He also said they operated under a non-existent housing estate scheme in Abuja and Nasarawa State.\nNta further said: ”Impressed by the action of the Commandant-General of the Corps by reporting his own officials for alleged wrong-doings and demanding an independent investigation while other heads of agencies or organisations will be covering it up if it were to be in their organisations.\nI commenced an immediate investigation by directing the Special Squad I set up on land matters to swing into action and the team even started with some officers who came with the C-G.\n“We made findings, we also made efforts to get additional information from other government agencies and banks which assisted us immensely in the course of our investigations. In the course of the investigation, we established that six different companies were used in the scam, and the bank accounts of certain officers and the companies used were frozen while we seized several property including 61 houses, 45 plots of land and a duplex traced to some of the officers.\nInterestingly, the 61 houses are made up of 40 units of three bedroom flats, 20 units of two bedroom flats and a duplex were seized from a single officer”.\nHe further stated that the company through which the NSCDC officials carried out the illegal deals were not among the six other companies that were investigated, even as he promised to commence another round of investigation on it.\nWhile stating that all the interrogated officers had been released on administrative bail except an official who was on the run, Nta said that investigation had revealed that the affected officers used the NSCDC’s Co-operative Society to swindle members of the public who thought it was a genuine transaction especially when it involved the name of the organization, the transactions taking place within the premises of the FCT Command of the Corps located at Gudu district and the officers wearing NSCDC uniforms during such illegal transactions.\nAsked if there would be any compensation for the 186 victims of the scam since the property of the perpetrators had been seized, Nta said: “That is beyond our power, the final decision rests on the court. Ours is to arrest, investigate and prosecute, but as we speak, we have established abuse of office against some of the officers investigated, it is the court that will now decide their fate, but the law recognizes the interest of procurer”.\nElated by the testimony, the Committee chaired by Hon Bimbo Daramola expressed gratitude to the ICPC boss, saying the revelation will help put an end to land scams in the capital city.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"http://www.vanguardngr.com/2013/11/icpc-recovers-61-houses-nscdc-officer/","2":"875","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999790192"},{"0":"Eyitayo Jegede and Jimoh Ibrahim\nBy Ikechukwu Nnochiri\nABUJA – The Supreme Court, Tuesday, gave the Justice Ibrahim Saulawa-led panel of the Court of Appeal in Abuja the nod to deliver judgment on dispute over who should be the flag-bearer of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, in the Ondo governorship election billed for November 26.\nThe apex court, in a unanimous ruling by a five-man panel of Justices led by the Acting Chief Justice of Nigeria, Justice Walter Onnoghen, declined to disband the the three-man Special Panel constituted by President of the Court of Appeal, Justice Zainab Bulkachuwa, to resolve the dispute.\nAside dismissing motions to stay proceedings of the appellate court, filed by six chieftains of the PDP in the South West led by Chairman of the party in Ondo State, Prince Biyi Poroye, the Supreme Court, awarded a cost of N1million each to the three Justices of the appellate court.\nPoroye and his group had joined the three appellate court Justices, Salauwa, Igwe Aguba and George Mbaba, as 5th to 7th Respondents in the appeal before the apex court.\nThe Acting CJN, Justice Onnoghen who delivered the lead ruling, ordered that counsel to the appellants, Chief Beluolisa Nwufor, SAN, should personally pay the cost from his pocket.\nThe apex court further ordered the appellants to pay N500, 000 cost to the four other Respondents in the matter among whom included a contender for the PDP governorship ticket, Mr. Eyitayo Jegede, SAN.\nJustice Onnoghen held that it was wrong for Poroye and his group to drag the appellate court Justices into the matter knowing that they were only carrying out a judicial duty that was duly assigned to them.\n“The 6th to 7th Respondents who are Justices of the Court of Appeal were constituted by appropriate authority to hear and determine the case were not parties before the lower court and whatever they did was in their official capacity as judicial officers”, Justice Onnoghen noted.\nHe stressed that joining them as Respondents in the matter “was not only an attempt to intimidate and scandalise the judiciary, but to put it in a mild way, an action in bad faith”.\nJustice Onnoghen also noted that the appellants (Poroye and his group), had also petitioned a previous panel of Justices of the appellate court that handled the case.\n“If the applicants are allowed to continue with this prank, there will be no end in sight and it will not augur well. In the circumstance, there is no merit in this appeal and it is hereby dismissed”.\nWhile concurring with the lead ruling, another member of the apex court panel, Justice Kumai Akaahs, held that action of the appellants was “capable of bringing anarchy”.\nHowever, the apex court panel fixed Thursday to hear the substantive appeal challenging leave that was granted to Jegede to appeal the June 29 judgement of Justice Okon Abang of the Federal High Court in Abuja which recognised Mr. Jimoh Ibrahim as flag-bearer of the PDP for the November 26 governorship poll in Ondo State.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"http://www.vanguardngr.com/2016/11/ondo-s-court-awards-n3m-court-justices-okays-verdict-jegedes-appeal/","2":"729","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999828339"},{"0":"Mrs. Helen Mark, wife of Senator David Mark, presents gifts to members of Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) camp in Agatu to celebrate the 68th birthday of the former Senate President.\n…… as life gradually returns to war ravaged communities\nFormer President of the Senate, Senator David Mark yesterday marked his 68th birthday with the Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) in Agatu local government area of Benue State rendered homeless aftermath of the massacre that left hundreds of people dead.

I think he needs to undergo a test for codeine and tramadol abuse to think that Nigerians can be fooled that Zakari’s recent appointment is not a back door move to make her relevant in caring for Buhari’s interests during the Presidential elections,” Frank stated.\nHe observed that even though Buhari benefitted from a free, fair and credible elections in 2015, he is not ready to advance the nation’s democracy by sticking to free and fair elections this time.\nFrank said: “This is largely why he has refused to signed the amended Electoral Act 2010 and has now shopped for his Neice to oversee the hatchet job of rigging him back to power.\n“Buhari is running away from a free and fair election. He is depending on INEC and the security forces to allocate votes to him. That is why he refused to sign the amended Electoral Act.\n“As a perpetual law breaker, he has again broken the law by refusing to allow the Inspector General of Police, Ibrahim Idris, to go on retirement after spending his ‘overly doctored 35 mandatory years’ in the service of the country as a Police Officer.”\nHe insisted that Nigerians are hopeful that Buhari’s desperation will not set Nigeria ablaze post elections but lamented that “the way he (Buhari) is going, crisis will definitely engulf the country because the opposition is determined not to accept any rigging or compromised electoral process during the next election.\n“If Buhari has any iota of integrity, let him demonstrate it now by allowing for a free, fair and credible elections in February and March. We know he has no integrity and the opposition is ready to meet any of his shenanigans with equal and greater shenanigans.”\nThe Bayelsa-born political activist called on all patriotic Nigerians including the NLC, TUC, ASUU, NASU, ASUP, NBA, NMA, traditional and religious leaders to speak up in order to avert Buhari’s rigging plot capable of plunging the country into a bitter and violent crisis.\nHe also called on the United Nations and Nigeria’s allies in the advanced democracies – as members of the international community -working to sustain peace across the world to come to the aid of Nigeria at its most trying times.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"https://www.vanguardngr.com/2019/01/timi-frank-calls-for-inec-chairmans-resignation/","2":"1119","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999542236"},{"0":"By JIMITOTA ONOYUME\nThe Archbishop of the Niger Delta North Diocese of the Anglican Church, Most Reverence Ignatius Kattey, kidnapped by some gunmen, was released Saturday night, according to the police.\nPublic Relations Officer of Rivers State Police Command, DSP Angela Agabe, in a telephone chat, said the cleric had been freed.\nIt could not be confirmed if any ransom was paid.

He claimed that he had been working for the church for some time now adding that the last job he did was not paid for and that his intention was to actually get the attention of the pastor for financial assistance.\nAhmed said: â€œI am somebody who learnt things by intuition, and so I was always browsing the net and because I have special interest in explosive I learnt how to make them.\nI actually made three explosives, it was the smallest one that exploded at Logemo House and got me injured. Like I said, I was in a financial mess after the lady in one of the branches terminated my contract with them. The church did not even pay me for the one we did earlier for them let alone the latest.\nSo I was frustrated and wanted something to do to feed my family. My mission at the Superscreen was to ask how much they pay for the shooting of soap operas and other things and not to hurt anybody.\nBut it happened that the man I met said the person who was in a position to give me some of the informationÂ was at the seventh floor. It was when I was going up that the explosive went off..â€\nRegretting his action, the failed bomber who spoke flawless English Language quoted some scriptures like â€œtouchÂ not my anointed and do my prophet no harm.â€\nThe incident which prompted yesterdayâ€™s confession, began, December 22, 2009, following an explosion on the fourth floor of the a nine-storey building at Onipanu along Ikorodu express road, where the bomb carrier was affected.\nThe explosives which was neatly wrapped as Christmas gift, was taken to Superscreen Television, on the ninth floor of the building when it exploded mid way, rocking the entire area.\nAt first, no one could give detailed account of the exact cause of the explosion, as there were varying accounts as to how the explosive got to the building.\nBut the following day, the Lagos Police Command boss, Mr. Marvel Akpoyibo, told anxious journalists that the victim of the blast was actually the messenger, adding that two additional explosives detonated by policemen from the Bomb Disposal Unit, were also discovered at the scene of the blast.\nAlthough Akpoyibo was silent on other salient issues concerning the explosion, he, however, promised to do so at the appropriate time, noting that when the suspectâ€™s abode, which he failed to disclose for what he described as security reasons, was searched, more items that aided the commandâ€™s investigation were discovered.\nVanguard, however, learnt that the suspect lived at the Fola Agoro area ofÂ Shomolu, where he occupied a room apartment on the ground floor of the two-storey building. He wife also was said to have hurriedly left the house, holding two polythene bags and a sac, with a baby strapped to her back two days before the incident.\nAfter the incident, security measures such as rigorous search of visitors into any of the companies in Logemo house was carried out. Vanguard gathered that the incident prompted the rejection of wrapped Christmas gifts from unknown persons, particularly by Supercreen Television staff.\nMeanwhile at the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital where the 30-year-old Olayinwola Ahmed was initially admitted at the intensive care unit, security was tightened as only designated doctors were allowed to attend to him.\nSome police nurses were also detailed to take care of him and also kept an eye on any visitor that requested to see him.

People have accused your government of lethargy.\nCritics have pointed to a streak of favouritism, if not nepotism, in the precious few appointments you have so far managed. Some, even of your own political party – the All Progressives Congress (APC) – have openly expressed doubts as to whether the change promised to dawn with the inception of your administration is in any way remotely resembled to what is so far self-evident. None of these is of immediate concern to me here.\nMy interest, Mr. President, is more fundamental since it touches on the very soul of Nigerian democracy, which you solemnly promised to nurture and enhance.\nIt was former US President Harry S. Truman who often admonished that, “If you can’t stand the heat,get out of the kitchen.” His context was political, an arena in which blackmail, disinformation, excoriation and scaremongering aggregate as the common fare of partisanship.In that regard, any politician worth the name takes the cue and delivers as much as he receives, if not much more.\nIn my view, however, ournation’s fight against the cankerworm of corruption should, first and foremost, be a patriotic national service, not a schedule for partisan dogfights. Unfortunately, the indiscriminate and groundless invectives currently being spewed by your political apostles are in dissonance with the democratic ethos you promised Nigeria.They boil down to hysteria. And they are guaranteed to be counter-productive because they promote the fallacy that to be of service to one’s fatherland is mutually exclusive with malfeasance.\nPlease permit me, Mr. President, to quote a famous mantra of yours: “If Nigeria does not kill corruption, corruption will kill Nigeria.” The fight against corruption is many-pronged. But it does not include the demonisation of the innocent.\nUnfortunately, some of your teammates have been on the rampage, leveling unwarranted and unsubstantiated charges against top functionaries of the administration you succeeded. For instance, Governor Adams Oshiomhole of Edo State has been vitriolic in his attacks against a Minister in the Jonathan administration whose offence, so far, appears to be her agreement to serve her country of birth.\nDoes Oshiomhole not appreciate the possibility of the truly guilty escaping justice via the highway of distraction he is busily generating by his wild apportionment of guilt with neither concrete evidence nor rudimentary trial in a court of competent jurisdiction?\nI raise for your consideration,and reversal, the interminable pillorying of Dr. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, the immediate past Coordinating Minister of the Economy and Minister of Finance by, not the wayward social media, but GovernorOshiomhole and a few others associated with him. Nearly thirty years ago, the inappropriateness of lumping guilt and innocence in a single category of censure and penalty was roundly denounced in circumstances that can only remain vivid in your memory, dear Mr. President.\nThefollowing is apart of President Ibrahim Babangida’s inauguration speech of August 27, 1985, the day he toppled your military junta: “While this government recognises the bitterness created by the irresponsible excesses of the politicians, we consider it unfortunate that methods of such nature as to cause more bitterness were applied to deal with past misdeeds. We must never allow ourselves to lose our sense of natural justice.\nThe innocent cannot suffer the crimes of the guilty.”\nHow can we, in all sincerity, find ourselves again at the point of reminding Your Excellency that “We must never allow ourselves to lose our sense of natural justice”? Really, how can we, especially bearing in mind your solemn declaration at your inauguration on May 29, 2015, to wit: “Having just a few minutes ago sworn on the Holy Book, I intend to keep my oath and serve as President to all Nigerians. I belong to everybody and I belong to nobody.”\nI crave your indulgence to briefly examine a religious aspect of the dreadful thing that is going on because, it is not at all certain that GovernorOshiomholeand his coterie have looked at all sides of everything. I am not a Muslim. I am a Christian (Catholic). But Islam is a religion I hold in high esteem. I understand that the basic principle of Sharia is that one’s testimony must be based on knowledge, clarity and trust.\nThe Noble Quran [43:86] says ”…But only those who testify to the truth [can benefit], and they know.” The Ninth Commandment of the Christian faith is a compelling injunction: “Thou shalt not bear false witness against your neighbour!”\nGovernor Oshiomhole’s smear campaign against the government of former President Jonathan may be down to personal grudge against some functionaries of that administration. His tenancy of the Edo State Government House expires in a year. When he vacates office, would the Comrade-Governor rather prefer a kind of treatment whereby, instead of examining his legacy with a sense of duty and balance, a band of critics would rise and drown out every other sound with incessant and mordant attacks on his name and person? The way things are going, it seems safe to suppose that the profession of faith is rampant among politicians who, nonetheless, consider the upholding of their religious tenets as the tiniest of concerns.\nThe penchant to heap every imaginable sin in the world on Dr. Okonjo-Iweala does not wash. Many Nigerians see this as unwarranted persecution. In so far as definitions go, Coordinating Minister does not mean Supervisory Minister. Ministers in the Jonathan administration did not report to Dr. Okonjo-Iweala. Why, then, is she being asked to account for all the Ministries in the last dispensation when all others who held down ministerial portfolios are alive and available? Anti-corruption fights often fail because people distract themselves chasing shadows. Mr. President, you should please prevent yourself from falling into this trap. The focus should be on priorities. Thank you, Mr. President, and may your administration represent a spell of God’s abundant blessings on Nigeria.\nAn educated and respectable lady, who claimed some presence around today’s corridors of power, averred that you recently said that yourpresidential tenure would be a loadstar and a legacy for the rest of African leaders to emulate. This moved me greatly, to the point that I offered an instant prayer for God to strengthen and direct your hand to the objective of meaningful and purposeful leadership. Now, Mr. President, you will not inhabit Aso Rock forever, even if you served multiple terms. The day will eventually come when you will become former President Muhammadu Buhari. How would it feel, if after you have done your bit and passed the baton, a rabble rises and scripts the lyrics of a scathing swansong for you that is antithetical to your presidential pedigree?\nWe pray, Mr. President, that commentators will not, in the ultimate, have cause to pronounce anathema on your administration. I am one of those persuaded that you mean well for Nigeria. For this, I recall again that the central platform of your campaign for the presidency is the fight against corruption.\nIs this fight now being prosecuted by the virulent attacks on the personality and integrity of Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, by Oshiomhole and company? Oshiomhole has, among many other indiscriminate charges, accused Dr. Okonjo-Iweala of spending $2.1 billion from the Excess Crude Account (ECA) without authorization! How can it be said that there was expenditure without authorization, when the evidence is there that authorization is undeniable?\nHow are we sure that the attacks on this woman is not down to the fact that she published details of the Excess Crude monies paid to the Governors most of whom cannot now pay salaries of their civil servants, or show to what useful purpose they put the funds they readily collected? Isn’t it obvious that there are high costs to pay for shadow chasing – like when wild allegations are concentrated on the innocent, while an expressway is paved for the escape of those who may have some explaining to do?\nIn your inaugural address, you paid tribute to President Jonathan for his statesmanship in “graciously accepting defeat” at the presidential ballot. With the most profound respect, I urge you to keep to that path of rectitude.I put it to you, Mr. President, that the fight against corruption, which you are leading, can do with one imperative, namely, the putting of an immediate end to unwarranted and unsubstantiated accusations that can only divert attention from the real culprits of corruption, if any?\nMr. Chuks Iloegbunam, a commentator on national issues, wrote from Lagos.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"http://www.vanguardngr.com/2015/07/open-letter-to-president-buhari/","2":"1913","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999656677"},{"0":"ABUJA—PPRESIDENT Goodluck Jonathan’s run for the 2011 presidency took another major leap, yesterday, with Igbo leaders in the 19 northern states endorsing his candidature for Saturday’s presidential election.\nAt a courtesy call on the President in State House, the delegation of over forty leaders of Igbo community associations in the 19 northern states commended President Jonathan for stabilizing the nation at a critical juncture of its history, noting that his administrative dexterity and egalitarian posture had endeared him to the hearts of not only the Igbo people but all Nigerians nationwide.\nMr. Oge Ogechukwu of the FCT chapter who spoke on behalf of others said the President’s detribalized stance has opened a vista of equal opportunities for all Nigerians.\nWhile assuring that Igbos in the northern states and nationwide will vote en masse for the President come Saturday, Ogechukwu said: “We will go to the hinterland to mobilise all our people that Mr. President must be made to stay in Aso Rock.”\nThe group urged the President to take more stringent measures to ensure security of lives and property of all Nigerians.\nPresident Jonathan thanked the delegation for endorsing him and said his administration in a fresh four year mandate will engender a nation where all Nigerians will pursue their aspirations without fear of molestation or discrimination.\nThe President promised to pursue the unity and development of the country at all times, noting that “development and poverty do not speak ethnic languages.”\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"http://www.vanguardngr.com/2011/04/igbo-leaders-in-north-back-jonathan/","2":"338","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999046326"},{"0":"Afrigroove.com is more than just a domain name; it's a statement.

So it is not debatable, it is something we have to addressed and we are working towards that with vigour. But if I’m voted into power within the next four years, the issue of power will become a thing of the past. Four years is enough for anyone in power to make significant improvement and if I can’t improve on power within this period, it then means I cannot do anything even if I am there for the next four years.”\nJonathan said this while interacting with Nigerians mainly diplomats working in the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa, UNECA, and the African Union, AU, in Addis-Ababa.\nWhile fielding questions from those present at the interactive session on whether Nigerians abroad will vote, Jonathan said: “I would have loved that the Nigerians in Diaspora vote this year but to be frank with you, that is going to be difficult now. Presently, the law does not allow the voting outside Nigeria and so this year Nigerians in Diaspora will not vote but I will work towards it by 2015 even though I will not be running for election.”\nOn the issue of security, Jonathan said the government was doing everything possible to arrest the situation. He disclosed that all those involved in the October 1 bombing had been arrested and were being prosecuted. He, however, said he ordered the release of the car dealers because they were just businessmen who could not have known that the vehicles were to be used for such heinous crime.\nOn education, the President said, the nine new approved universities were to be specialised and to be headed by at least three Nigerians experts in Diaspora.\nOn the concerns raised of having a database of Nigerian experts in Diaspora, President Jonathan assured that he was working on creating a forum for interaction between them and government and also develop a database, where experts needed to address the various challenges of the economy will be drawn. He hinted that this was why the Diaspora Commission was being set up as the bill was already before the National Assembly.\nThe President also disclosed that the government is looking towards reviewing the country’s foreign policy to ensure that Nigeria gets maximum benefit from its roles and contributions to international organizations like the AU, UN and ECOWAS.\nHe lamented that right now Nigeria’s contributions were not being recognized adding that “there is need for Nigeria to have something in return for our investments. We are investing so much but it is not being noticed and there is need to reverse that trend.\nOn the concerns about road network and transportation in the country, President Jonathan assured that the railway system will be revamp because presently heavy duty vehicles were destroying the roads. “Why we cannot have continuous road maintenance for now because no contractor wants to go into it because of the continuous pressure on the road by heavy duty vehicles. That is why we are working to ensure that we revamp the rail”.\nThe President also assured that Nigerians working in international organization and institutions would be issued diplomatic passports. He directed the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Odein Ajumogobia to submit the list of those qualified within the shortest possible time to him.\nOn the 35 per cent affirmative action implementation and the domestication of protocols signed, he assured that he will present before the National Assembly within the shortest possible time\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"http://www.vanguardngr.com/2011/02/i-ll-not-contest-2015-election-jonathan/#sthash.TaENhMD8.dpufThat","2":"817","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999885559"},{"0":"What becomes of Jonathan’s women?\nIn the past few years, the administration of outgoing President Goodluck has given women more voice in government. While some of the women were humble with power, others became burdens to the government. In this piece, YUSUF ALLI, MANAGING EDITOR, NORTHERN OPERATION looks at what next for Jonathan’s women.\nDisputably, the outgoing government of President Goodluck Jonathan prided itself as having increased women’s participation in government from 10% to above 30 %. In a foreword to a book, Goodluck Ebele Jonathan, Champion for Women, the controversial Minister of Petroleum Resources, Mrs. Diezani Alison-Madueke, said: “This is indeed, not just historic, but something special in the history of Nigeria! Half the world’s population is female but the international average of women in elected office is only around 20%. Look at the top office-holders, and the figure is lower still; in Nigeria, however, one in three members of the Federal Executive Cabinet is a woman. It is a fact of which all Nigerians, male and female, can be justly proud.”\nSome of the key appointments bestowed on women in the last four years were the Chief Justice of the Federation, ministerial appointments, Directors-General / Executive Secretaries of key parastatals, the first female Rear Admiral, and the enrolment of female regular combatant into the Nigeria Defence Academy among others.\nBut the most contentious had to do with the appointment of female ministers. It was a motley crowd with mixed grill results. From the self-styled mother of the nation, First Lady Dame Patience Jonathan, whose grammatical blunders were theatrical, to the untouchable ex-Minister of Aviation, Stella Oduah.\nThe women in Jonathan’s team regaled the nation with different scenarios. Miffed by the absurdity of some of the women in government, ex-President Olusegun Obasanjo at a point said there were five presidents in Nigeria, referring to President Jonathan, the First Lady, Minister of Petroleum Resources, Mrs. Diezani Alison-Madueke; ex-Minister of Aviation, Stella Oduah; and the Minister of Finance and the Coordinating Minister of the Economy, Dr.(Mrs.) Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala.\nTheir unexpected disengagement from power leaves a question: what becomes of them? The list includes the first female Minister of Petroleum Resources, Mrs. Alison-Madueke; the Minister of Finance, Mrs. Okonjo-Iweala; the Minister of Water Resources, Mrs. Sarah Ochekpe; Oloye Jumoke Akinjide; the Minister of Communication Technology, Mrs. Omobola Johnson; Minister of Women Affairs and Social Development, Hajiya Zainab Maina; Minister of State for Education, Prof. Viola Onwuliri; and Minister of State for Agriculture, Hajia Asabe Asmau Ahmed.\nOthers are Minister of Land, Housing and Urban Development, Mrs. Akon Eyakenyi; Minister of Environment, Mrs. Lawrencia Laraba-Mallam; Minister of Information, Sen. Patricia Akwashiki; Minister of State for Niger Delta Affairs, Mrs. Hauwa’u Lawan Bappa; ex-Minister of Aviation, Stella Oduah; ex-Minister of Environment, Mrs. Hadiza Ibrahim Mailafia; ex-Minister of Lands, Housing and Urban Development, Lady Amal Pepple; ex-Minister of Education, Prof. Ruqayyatu Ahmed Rufai; ex-Minister of State for Power, Hajiya Zainab Ibrahim Kuchi; ex-Minister of State for Defence, Erelu Olusola Obada.\nThe 61-year old, Minister of Finance since 2011 had occupied the same office between 2003 and 2006. For a brief period, she was also Minister of Foreign Affairs. Her second missionary journey into the Federal Executive Council has been lack luster, riddled with controversies and largely a disaster. Right from the onset, she assumed the unconstitutional status of the Coordinating Minister for the Economy to the consternation of her colleagues in the cabinet. In spite of the constitutional aberration of the office as conferred on her with fiat by the President, she pretended all was well while usurping the position of Vice President Namadi Sambo, who is naturally in charge of the coordination of the economy. Besides most Ministers go cap in hand to her for budgetary allocation, the implementation of the nation’s budget had hardly reached 60 per cent implementation in the last four years. To her credit, the economy grew to become the largest in Africa, following a rebasing exercise, with little impact on the standard of living of Nigerians. Although Okonjo-Iweala serves on the Advisory Board of Global Financial Integrity, it was amazing that under her nose there was fuel subsidy scam and about $20b oil cash could not be accounted for. All manner of consultants were imported to manage the economy in one form or the other. There can be no better verdict on the state of the economy than the 10-page treatise of a former Governor of Central Bank of Nigeria, Prof Chukwuma Soludo, who said: “Our public finance is hemorrhaging to the point that estimated over N30tn is missing, or stolen or unaccounted for, or simply mismanaged.” Certainly, this her second coming has affected her rating as a development economist. She is likely to return to her NGO, NOI Global Consulting after a troubled tenure. But no one will listen to her shriek voice anymore. Above all, she has a job to clear her name of the financial sleaze in President Jonathan’s government.\nBorn in December 1960, the Queen of the oil sector has set a record of being the most powerful minister Nigeria has ever produced. Her words were law in the Federal Executive Council and no Minister could oppose her memo. Doing so will incur the wrath of the powers that be.\nMinisters dote on her because that is the surest way to win the hearts of forces at the Presidential Villa. Once at a session of the Federal Executive council (FEC), she banged the phone to the consternation of all. Yet, there was no reprimand because she towers above all. In his bid to get reappointment after cabinet dissolution, a former Minister allegedly once prostrated for Alison-Madueke in her home.\nA mermaid with her unique beauty, the minister who grew up in Mubi had been a trail blazer with many firsts including the first Nigerian woman to be on the board of Shell Petroleum Development Company, Nigeria; the first female Minister of Petroleum Resources; the first female Petroleum Minister to work with five Group Managing Directors of Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC); and the first female OPEC President. The fuel subsidy scam under her care led to a nationwide shut down in January 2012 and the protest almost brought the Jonathan administration to its knees. Apart from the local content development initiative, it is difficult to point out any spectacular achievement of her in office. The failures were like anthills: over $20b oil funds unaccounted for; disinvestment in the oil sector by International Oil Companies (IOCs); fall in the sale of crude oil; non-passage of the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB); increase in oil theft; award of N4b pipeline protection contract to ex-militants and militia leaders. Although she still has an assignment in OPEC, it is likely she might step aside as the cartel’s President because the slot is usually for a country and not an individual. What next is being a player in the oil sector. But before she becomes an oil baroness, she may appear before many panels to defend her tenure. She will have rough days ahead but she has the gut to survive the odds.\nThe Minister of Communication Technology was born on June 28, 1963 to the family of the late High Chief Bayo Akinnola, who was the Lisa of Ondo Kingdom. Born into a family noted for its integrity and hard work, she was the Country Director of Accenture (a Management Consultancy Group) before she emerged as a Minister. Though on the quiet side, she has been able to achieve an increase in ratio of mobile subscriptions from 68.49% in 2011 to about 85% in 2015. Also, the mobile phone coverage which stood at 40% in 2012 might increased to about 55 to 60 per cent before the end of the year. Her greatest weakness is the inability of her ministry to address epileptic GSM service by telecoms firms. Though the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) imposed over N1.17billion on some telecoms firms, the sanctions were like mere slap on the wrist. Mrs. Johnson might return to the private sector after leaving office.\nSARAH RENG OCHEKPE\nA quiet and highly religious Minister, Mrs. Sarah Ochekpe was born in October 1961. A trained journalist and holder of Master’s Degree in Public Administration from the University of Jos. During her tenure, Nigeria has been able to achieve about 69-70 per cent access to potable water; constructed or rehabilitated 33 dams and 28 earth dams nationwide; and executed 15 irrigation projects which could create two million jobs when fully utilized. The ministry also secured a N2.4billion grant from Japan for water supply to five states. She was also able to address annual flooding in the country by developing Flood Control and Early Warning System (FEWS). For the first time in the history of the Ministry of Water Resources, she ran a trouble or scandal free tenure. Soft spoken and brilliant, Mrs. Ochekpe ran into political storm when she coordinated the controversial campaign dinner for the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and President Goodluck Jonathan where about N21billion was raised beyond the N1billion campaign limit in the Electoral Act 2010 (as amended). Before she could be consumed by the campaign fund crisis, former Minister of Information, Prof. Jerry Gana came to her aid by claiming that the funds were meant for the completion of PDP National Secretariat. After May 29, Mrs. Ochekpe will remain a key grassroots player in Plateau State from where she was catapulted into national limelight. She used to be a member of Afri Foundation seeking to tackle poverty in Africa. Definitely, she will return to local politics because she is rated as “loyal”.\nA product of Harvard Law School, the 56-year old Oloye Jumoke Akinjide is often judged in the shadow of her father, Chief Richard Osuolale Akinjide (SAN) who was known for the controversial 12 2/3 politics at the Presidential Election Tribunal in 1979 which led to the upholding of the election of ex-President Shehu Shagari. Oloye Akinjide’s vision was for the FCT to be “among the top 20 capital cities in the world.” But she is leaving a decrepit city whose master plan has been abused by Abuja land grabbers. All the six Area Councils she superintends are gradually turning into slums where nothing works. She has spent the last two years preoccupied with politics in Oyo State because of her deferred governorship aspiration. She is likely to return to her Newman Legal Office after her tenure has elapsed. But take a bet, she will not stop playing politics in Oyo State because she thinks she is a force to reckon with.\nA Professor of Biochemistry, she was a shadow minister under the administration of President Goodluck Jonathan in the last four years.\nHer devastating moment in office was when she lost her amiable husband, Prof. Celestine Onwuliri in the DANA Air crash of June 3, 2012. A mother of five and grandmother of three, she was born in June 1956.\nWhile as a Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, she was in charge of bilateral agreements and the coordination of Bi-National Commission with the United States. She burnt her political fingers recently when she was involved in a protest march with some widows in Owerri, Imo State. With the way she was panting after a raw deal in Owerri, she does not have a strong heart for politics. She has the choice to return to the Faculty of Medical Sciences at the University of Jos or engage in NGO and church activities which have earned her more than 200 recognitions.\nOne of the oldest in the cabinet, Hajiya Maina was born in 1948. A caterer par excellence, she has spent a greater part of her life as an advocate for women. Apart from being a former National President of the National Council for Women Societies of Nigeria, the climax of her career was in 1994 when she was appointed as the Executive Secretary of the Adamawa State Women Commission. During her administration, she has been able to prevail on 23 states to pass the Child Rights Act; she launched the National Database for Vulnerable Children; promoted Affirmative Action which led to more positions for women beyond the 20% target set by the UN and establishment of skill acquisition schemes in 20 VVF Rehabilitation centres nationwide. She is going back to the grassroots for more women advocacy after May 29.\nDespite the fact that she is no longer in President Jonathan’s cabinet, Princess Stella Oduah is one of the five mighty hands behind the wheels in the presidency. In and out of office, she remains an unseen hand. While in office, she embarked on the remodeling of Lagos New General Aviation Terminal, and airports in Kano, Maiduguri, Sokoto, Ilorin, Katsina, and Akure. She also renovated Hajj terminals in Kano, Kaduna, Abuja and Sokoto. Hardworking but rated as power drunk, the 53-year old ex-Minister was one of the “untouchables” in Jonathan’s cabinet until she was indicted for the purchase of two bulletproof (armoured cars) at a cost of N255million for use as a Minister. The scam led to her unceremonious exit from the cabinet.\nPresident Jonathan’s foot-dragging on Oduah’s fate almost created a moral problem for his administration. After sullen period, the princess has regained her track. She is now a Senator-elect from Anambra State.\nAfter May 29, she has a date with history because she is still being investigated by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC).\nUntil she was suddenly sacked by President Goodluck Jonathan, she was one of the most experienced female ministers Nigeria has ever produced. Armed with a First Class Bachelor’s Honours from University of Ife (now Obafemi Awolowo University), she was a Clerk to the Senate, ex-Permanent Secretary in seven Federal Ministries. As a Minister, she developed National Housing Policy and National Urban Development Policy. Her early exit from the cabinet was due to her audacity in telling the President to settle his political differences with Governor Rotimi Amaechi. Not minding her age, she knelt down for President Jonathan in order to avert the inevitability of losing his re-election bid. She was booted out of the cabinet. But today, she can walk tall because she has been vindicated by the defeat of Jonathan. She is a good chorister in church. She might bounce back to power soon.\nBorn on November 2, 1953, Patricia Naomi Akwashiki, once representing Nasarawa North as a Senator. Though she is presently the Minister of Information, she was yet to settle down when her boss was defeated during the Presidential Election. As a Senator, she sponsored a bill to amend the Code of Conduct Bureau Act. As a politician, she had defected from the defunct All Nigeria Peoples Party (ANPP) to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). She may likely return to politics which has entered her blood.\nASABE ASMAU AHMED\nBefore her appointment, she has had a brilliant career in the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) and what a source described as a “rewarding experience” in the private sector. A reputable town planner, Asabe is also respected for her frankness, honesty and devotion to duty. She will surely go back to the private sector.\nA former Commissioner for Industry, Commerce and Tourism in Akwa IbomState, she is a nominee of Governor Godswill Akpabio.

We must rise as a people and carry our destiny in our hands.\n“We will never allow somebody who does not have the interest of the people of the North to dabble into its politics in 2015.\n“In any case, if Obasanjo cannot win a ward in his local government area ofOgunState, is it inKanoor Sokoto that his candidate can win?”\nObasanjo is a political liability to the North\nThe political commentator made it clear that those who were being bandied as Obasanjo’s candidates in the North should work hard and win the confidence of the people if they wanted to be elected rather than go to sleep with the erroneous impression that the former leader could guarantee them easy access to the Presidential Villa.\nHe said: “It appears to me that Obasanjo is more of a political liability to the North and anyone who puts his hope in him in 2015 is doing so at his/her own peril.\n“The irony is that some uninformed persons still believe that Obasanjo has what it takes to put them in certain political offices inNigeria. That is not possible particularly in the North.”\nThe medical doctor-turned politician said the North would devise a more democratic means than zoning to elect its leaders in 2015 to heal the wounds of the past political mistakes and move the people of the region andNigeriaforward.\nIgbo Presidency not feasible in 2015\nMohammed said Igbo Presidency would not be feasible in 2015 given the penchant of the people of the region to pull down their own rather than speak with one voice to achieve their set goal.\nHe maintained thatNigerianeeded a leader who could pull it out of the present predicament and take the people to a new level of socio-economic and political prosperity.\nThere have been reports that Obasanjo is in support of two northern governors to run as President in 2015.\nOf the two, Governor Sule Lamido of JigawaStaterecently told Vanguard that he was flattered by the link of his name with the 2015 job. He did not deny nor confirm the claim.\nThe man he was touted to be running with, Gov.

When I was appointed the Minister for Transportation, the president warned–do not start new contracts, go and complete old ones.\n“We met Itakpe –Warri Rail line which had been in existence for 34 years uncompleted; it would have been the first Standard Guage line in Africa if it was completed.\n“Based on the president’s instruction, I did a memo; I thought we will borrow money from China; but the president refused. He said we should use our internal funds to execute the project.\n“People saw me on social media on Train service from Warri to Itakpe. I got to Warri 8pm because I was going from one station to the other—almost all the villages and most prominent members of PDP made sure that train stations were in their villages.\n“So, I am compelled to do those stations in villages of members of PDP; it is okay; it is the instruction of the president that you must go and finish the old work.’’\nHe said that the tradition in the past was that once one was elected, one left the old things for the old people and awarded new contracts.\nAccording to Amaechi, the ministry will start commercial service from Itakpe to Warri.\nOn PDP’s argument that it started the projects, Amaechi said that Buhari made it clear on commissioning the Abuja –Kaduna rail project that the project was started by the former government of President Goodluck Jonathan.\n“We completed it but two things are remarkable—we borrowed 500 million dollars to start that project at the time oil was selling at 114 dollars per barrel.\n“ We should not have borrowed; you mean this country could not have afforded 500 million dollars?\n“I will show that we can; when I wrote a memo to the president and to the cabinet requesting that he should allow me borrow 500 million dollars from China to buy locomotives and coaches for Lagos-Ibadan, the cabinet under the directive of the president refused.\n“He(the president) said 500 million dollars; we can get from here and we are funding it from here; so we did and completed Kaduna to Abuja quickly.\n“We spend N56million per month and we get N16 million; so we are augmenting for both rich and poor—N40 million per month under the directive of the president because he fears that the poor might not be able to afford it. So, everybody is using it.’’\nAccording to him, Lagos to Ibadan railway is almost complete—a distance of 156kms.\nThe minister said that application had also been made to construct Kano to Kaduna railway as approval for funds is being awaited.\n“We are about to award the central line from Abuja to Niger to Baru from Baru to Itakpe to Warri; the president had approved a new seaport in Warri. We are negotiating with a Chinese company which will build it.\n“Do not forget that N2.7 billion dollars is N1 trillion. So, we are looking for money to commence already awarded work on the coastal rail.\n“The coastal rail starts from Lagos, from Lagos; it passes through Ogun State, Ondo, Benin, Asaba, and Onitsha. From Benin again, it passes through Warri, Sapele, Ughelli, to Bayelsa, in fact, it goes to Utuoke. From Otuoke, it goes to Port Harcourt.\n“ Then from Port Harcourt, it goes to Aba, Uyo, and ends up in Cross River State.\n“We are almost ready to award Port Harcourt to Maidugiri.

The Encyclopaedia Britannica defines genocide as “the deliberate and systematic destruction of a group of people because of their ethnicity, nationality, religion, or race. The term, derived from the Greek genos (“race,” “tribe,” or “nation”) and the Latin cide (“killing”), was coined by Raphael Lemkin, a Polish-born jurist who served as an adviser to the U.S. Department of War during World War II.\nThe term was coined in 1943 by the Jewish-Polish lawyer Raphael Lemkin who combined the Greek word “genos” (race or tribe) with the Latin word “cide” (to kill).\nThat such an unprovoked gruesome mass murder of hundreds of people took place at Asaba, is not in question anymore. What really happened that October 1967? As Emmanuel Andrew Chukwuedo Nwanze, BSc. MSc. Ph.D. DIS, Professor of Neurobiochemistry and former Vice-Chancellor, University of Benin said in a lecture: “Asaba people came out from their homes and places of other engagements in response to a call to come out and welcome and receive the conquering Federal troops. When the troops requested them to separate into groups of males and females, they naively complied, never having ever witnessed such an event before. The men were marched away to the more secluded axis of Ogbe Osowe- Ilo-Umuaji-Ogbe Ilo. When the guns started blazing it was too late to escape. The staccato over, only the groans of those on the throes of death could be heard with blood flowing freely: indeed ‘blood on the Niger’. The few alive or not completely dead who had been clobbered to the ground by the falling dead could be heard calling on the soldiers to come on and finish the job. Hence the weak cries of “See me, I never die o”\nMr. Chiedu “Cassy” Juwah was about ten years old then. He recalled that “People were dancing in a welcome party at OgbeIlo field. Then soldiers stopped the music and a grim business began. That was how Asaba became a town of landladies. My cousin who had survived the pogrom at Kano, his dad and two elder brothers, were shot. I hid and returned home. The following day, 7th, we were rounded up and shepherded to Oma, opposite today’s Grand Hotel, That’s where we were separated. At Ogbe Osowe, the men were separated from the boys and the women, and I, a boy, joined the women in going to the Convent, now St. John Bosco’s Church at Nnebisi Rd, and Ogbe Osowe became a killing field. My brother, Augustine Juwah, who passed out of St. Anthony’s College in 1964, pretended to be dead and hid among dead bodies there as a machine gun belched fire and death. By 8.pm he made his way home and we started our flight; first to Achala, and from there to Ubulu-Uku. Some people returned home days later and were still killed in the house-to-house combing by the military.”\nThe Federal troops thundered into Asaba on the 5th. The Biafrans had melted away as the immediate commander, the late Col. Joe Achizia (a son of Asaba), opted to retreat to Onitsha as a lorry load of cutlass was all he was given to defend Asaba with. He blew up the Niger Bridge. Then, the indiscriminate killing started. It turned horrendous on the 6th and became hellish on the 7th.\nAbout 1, 000 persons died in Asaba in those gruesome three days. Yet, more died later as the town’s folks fled into the bush, trying to escape to the nearby towns and villages. Many were caught outside the town while escaping and were decimated, others died from hunger and unhealed wounds inside the bush.\nIn fact, the killing spilled into Ogwashi-Uku, and several other towns in the Anioma Delta North Senatorial District. In Ishiagwu, a coastal village to which Biafrans would travel to from around Oguta to buy food stuff, having crossed the lordly River Niger by canoe, the Federal troops visited one night and simply killed 400 people who failed to escape and burnt down the village – even as a General Cyril Iweze, a son of Ishiagwu, was fighting on the Federal side. Ibusa suffered genocide and the entire surviving population fled into the bush.\nREAD ALSO: Boko Haram sacks two communities in Borno\nAs late into the war as 1969, the killings were still on. A Benin-City based medical Doctor, Patrick Anyafulu said: In 1969, a company of Federal troops was ambushed and decimated by Biafran troops on the road leading to Asaba from Oko. That incident brought the horrors of war to my sleepy, rustic village. The whole village was razed to the ground. We escaped death through Providence…a heavy rainstorm the previous night delayed their advance from Asaba, and fishermen who had gone to check their nets saw them and alerted the whole village. Shells were already landing in the village and the air was filled with the whine of bullets. We escaped into the forest and lived there until 1970!”\nSo, why has the Federal Government, which has recently acknowledged the evil inherent in denying the late MKO Abiola his June 1993 electoral victory, refused to even recognise the atrocity committed against Asaba and other Anioma towns? As hard as that insult upon injury is difficult to swallow, it is pertinent to remember that for years the Asaba massacre was a totally hushed up topic.\nA London Times correspondent, Bill Norris, who passed through Asaba in mid-October 1967, sent back photos of hellish destruction there and noted that the town appeared to be largely abandoned. But he said nothing about the genocide. He explained in a 2012 interview that he did not know about the massacre. The first mention of mass killing in Asaba appeared in the London Observer, almost four months later, when Africa correspondent Colin Legum conûrmed that Federal troops took part in the killing. However, his (second-hand) account claimed that a group of ‘implacably hostile’ Igbo attacked troops by surprise as they watched the welcome dance, leading to retaliation.\nEven both pro-Biafra and pro-Nigeria writers of book on the Civil War left the Asaba massacre well alone. The Nigerian Army made no attempt during or after the Civil War, to investigate the Asaba Massacre. Yet, The London Observer commented on it on 21 January 1968, Le Monde, the French evening newspaper, wrote about it on April 5, 1968, LOOK, the British magazine, did same and even a Canadian Member of Parliament, who served as the UN Observer, Stephen Lewis, was mentioned in the London Observer on October 11, 1968. Yet, the then Nigerian High Commissioner to Britain, Brig. B. O. Ogundipe called the reports “wild rumours”. The Times of London reported in 1968 that Biafran propaganda had instilled fear of federal soldiers in Igbo people, but these fears were unfounded. A year later, the Times reported that an international observer team had “been unable to ûnd one single trace of mass killings of Ibos”.\nAn Asaba indigene, Sylvester Okocha, then senior civil servant in Benin, wrote to the International Committee of the Red Cross describing what had just happened. His letter was intercepted by the military, he was arrested, tortured and incarcerated in Lagos.\nNow, the truth is out…and it is horrendous. There are only two choices left for Nigeria: to keep ignoring this sordid fact and allow the sore to fester and become food for agents of national disunity or address it so that healing can begin. Yet, the silence has really ended, what continues is national self-deception. An Asaba indigene, and journalist, Emma Okocha published the book Blood on the Niger in 1994 (his father was a victim of that massacre). It lifted the lid off that story and has remained a condemnation on the government’s official silence on the Asaba massacre – that terrible blot on Nigeria’s history.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"https://www.vanguardngr.com/2020/10/asaba-massacre-terrible-blot-on-nigerias-history/","2":"1905","3":"Politics","4":"3","5":"en","6":"0.9999027252"},{"0":"By Ikechukwu Nnochiri\nABUJA—The Abuja Division of the Federal High Court will, today, determine whether or not the former Governor of Akwa Ibom State, Senator Godswill Akpabio is qualified to be appointed as the Minority Leader of the 8th Senate.\nThe suit, which was lodged before the court by two members of Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, from Rivers and Imo states, Alaye Pedro and Dr. Okechukwu Ibeh, respectively, has 18 Senators from the South-South geo-political zone as defendants.\nThe plaintiffs are praying the court to restrain the Senate President, Bukola Saraki, and members of PDP caucus from the South-South in the Senate from appointing the Senate Minority Leader outside the provision of Order 3(2) of Senate Standing Orders 2015 (as amended).\nThe aforementioned rule of the Senate prohibits the appointment of a first time Senator as a principal officer.\nThe plaintiffs maintained that whereas PDP is the leading minority party in the Senate and is entitled to produce the Minority Leader, they contended that in line with Order 3(2) of Senate Standing Orders 2015, ranking must be the basis for appointment of such principal officer.\nThey averred before the court that “ranking ensures that principal officers posses adequate experience and avoids promoting junior over senior,” adding that in zoning the position of the Minority Leader to South-South, PDP take into consideration the ranking of PDP senators from the zone.\nThe plaintiffs, however, decried that “a clique within the larger PDP caucus in the 8th National Assembly has concluded plans to subvert the mandatory provision of Order 3(20) of the Senate Standing Orders by selecting or appointing the Minority Leader by a procedure in breach of Order 3(2) of the Senate Standing Orders 2015.”\nConsequently, they urged the court to intervene by ensuring that the proper procedure was adhered to by the leadership of the Senate with regards to the appointment of Minority Leader.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"http://www.vanguardngr.com/2015/07/senate-minority-leader-court-rules-on-suit-challenging-akpabios-eligibility-today/","2":"435","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9998607635"},{"0":"Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue State has in an unusual fashion invited President Muhammadu Buhari to commission two newly constructed cell blocks at the Makurdi medium correctional centre in the wake of jailbreaks across the country.\nOrtom disclosed this at a meeting with the people of Ugondo, the host community for the correctional service, warning them against encroaching on land ceded to the service and any other federal agency contributing to the growth and security of the people of Benue.\nREAD ALSO: Wike Invites Buhari, Oshiomhole, Obi To Inaugurate Rivers Projects\nThe invitation is coming amid his disagreement with the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar which seems irredeemable.\nOrtom is also a prominent member of the PDP G5 led by his Rivers State counterpart, Nyesom Wike.

Jolla, a smaller Finnish start-up founded by former Nokia engineers, has only recently started selling its own handset aimed at a global audience.\nAt a kick-off event at the popular Garage Center for Contemporary Culture in downtown Moscow, the chief executive of Yota Devices, Vladislav Martynov, said the introduction of dual screens was “a revolution in telephone architecture” and would conserve battery life.\nMr. Martynov said that the electronic-ink display on the back of the Yotaphone would show information, including feeds from Facebook and Twitter, even when the phone is not in use. “Before Yotaphone, this space was useless,” he said.\nWhile Russian Internet companies like the Yandex search engine are popular in Russia and software companies like Kaspersky Lab, an antivirus developer, have found international success, there have been no breakout leaders among Russian consumer technology producers, a sector where the country has traditionally lagged.","1":"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/05/business/international/russias-first-smartphone-goes-on-sale.html?src=recgRussia","2":"372","3":"Phones","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9998664856"},{"0":"Buhari departs abuja for sochi, participates in Russia-Nigeria Summit\nBy Agency Reporter\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari on Monday departed Abuja for Sochi, Russia to attend a three-day Russia-Africa Summit holding from Oct. 23 to Oct. 25.\nThe News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that before leaving the presidential villa for onward journey to Sochi, Buhari carried out some official engagements where he was briefed by some cabinet ministers.\nNAN reports that the presidential aircraft conveying the president and some members of his entourage took off from the Presidential Wing of the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja (NAIA) at about 2.15 p.m.\nThe presidential aircraft is expected to arrive Sochi International Airport at about 22.30 p.m. (Local Time) with the temperature out at 22 degrees centigrade.\nAn earlier statement by the President’s spokesman, Malam Garba Shehu, in Abuja on Sunday said the summit would focus on exploring and expanding opportunities in security, trade and investment, science and technology, and gas production.\nDuring the summit, according to the statement, Buhari will meet with President Vladimir Putin of Russia to further strengthen relations between Nigeria and Russia.\nShehu said that the two leaders would hold bilateral talks on security, trade and investment, and building partnership that would enhance Nigeria’s huge gas potential following Russia’s remarkable success in gas exportation.\n“The summit, which will be attended by African Heads of State will bring fresh perspectives on some global issues and challenges like nuclear technology, energy development, digital transformation, environment, technical security, mining and steel, education, agriculture, infrastructure and development strategies.\n“An African Business Forum, which will bring together African and Russian business leaders will be held during the event to enhance Russian investments in Africa and promote African business interest in the host country,’’ he said.\nThose on the president’s entourage included governors Muhammad Yahaya of Gombe, Bello Matawalle of Zamfara and Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti state.\nOthers also on the trip are ministers of Foreign Affairs, Geoffrey Onyeama, Trade and Investment, Adeniyi Adebayo, Minister of Mines and Steel Development, Olamilekan Adegbite and Minister of State, Petroleum, Timipre Sylva.","1":"https://thenationonlineng.net/buhari-departs-abuja-for-sochi-participates-in-russia-nigeria-summit/","2":"505","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9996567369"},{"0":"The Nigeria Governors’ Forum (NGF) on Wednesday in Abuja said the task ahead of the incoming All Progressives Congress (APC)-led government was enormous.

The statement, signed by Mr Asishana Okauru, the forum`s Director-General, prayed that God would use the APC and Buhari to bring the desired change to the country.\n“We congratulate the APC for the emergence of Gen.

David Mark\nBY Emma Ujah, Abuja Bureau Chief\nSenate President David Mark’s quest for a vast land where he is said to be planning a university in his native Otukpo, Benue State, has pitted him against peasant farmers in Asa III, who claim that the retired military officer-turned- politician wants to deprive them of their farm land, their only means of livelihood.\nThe move was said to have started in the first quarter of the year when a delegation of the nation’s number three citizen, led by one Chief Obogo Alapa, met some Asa III elders to inform them of the proposed university which, it stressed, would bring development to the area.\nIt was learnt that the villagers told the delegation that they welcomed the development, but that they needed to know the exact size of land and in which area of the village before they could give their terms.\nConsequently, it was agreed that the delegation should take representatives of the villagers to the area and show them the location and size.\nThis was later undertaken, with a bulldozer setting out what represented the area of interest for the proposed institution. The said land, according Mr. Sam Obochi, measures about “4 x 4” km, covering the farmlands of many families. The area demarcated alegedly extended from Asa III to their boundary with Akpegede village on the one hand, and their boundary with Otobi on the other.\nHowever, trouble started when the villagers discovered that bulldozers were sent in to clear the vast farmland without any further discussions with them. “The Alapa delegation that went to show the villagers the area to be taken by the university project did not return to give the villagers any feedback”, the villagers claimed.\nSome of the villagers went to their farms and asked the bulldozer operators to stop work on the grounds that the said land belonged to their families and that at no time did they hand over the land to anybody for any project.\nAs learnt, the workers ignored the villagers which led to protests during which the villagers blocked the main road that passes through Asa III in their efforts to attract public attention to their plight.\nIf the villagers expected any form of sympathy, what they allegedly got was a rude shock as, rather than coming for negotiations, those taking their land were said to have mobilized persons from Igbanomaje, Otukpo, to attack them. The assailants were said to have invaded Asa III and shot six of the villagers, burnt down houses of those considered as the arrowheads of the alleged land-grab opposition, and looted every store in sight.\nThe villagers ran into the bush and kept away from their homes for four days. Those who ventured into the village were said to have been arrested by gun- wielding vigilante and policemen brought in from Otukpo. 18 persons were allegedly arrested including three minors. 15 were detained in Makurdi Police Station while the minors were detained in the Juvenile Detention Center, Gboko.\nAs learnt, six men were shot by the attackers and had to be rushed to the General Hospital Otukpo. But even at the hospital, the police went after them and attempted to arrest them. It took the resistance of the hospital staff to stop further action against the villagers who then sneaked out of the hospital that night to secret locations outside Otukpo to seek medical help.\nTwo weeks after the attack, leaders of the village, it was learnt, sent an emissary to Alapa, the alleged leader of Mark’s representatives, to express their disappointment over the attack on Asa III.\nA peace meeting was reportedly held with the Alapa group on June 21. The Chairman of Otukpo Local Government Council, Dr. Innocent Onuh, was one of the leaders that attended the meeting. That meeting was held at the palace of the Ad’ Alekwu of Asa III, Mr. Inalegwu Onche, where the villagers claimed to have told Mark’s representatives that due process should be followed if the Senate President wanted to acquire land for his university project.\nThe following day, the villagers said policemen from Otukpo Divisional Police Headquarters invaded the village at about 5.30 am to arrest some youths.\nThose who noticed the arrival of the policemen were said to have alerted others by phone. Those who could not get the information on time were arrested while those who escaped arrest had their Okadas (motorcycles) taken away. The villagers then mobilized and insisted that every villager must be taken to the police station. Overwhelmed, Sunday Vanguard was told, the police started firing into the air to disperse the crowd. In the process, one of the police constables was shot due to accidental discharge by a fellow police man.\nThis was said to have infuriated the policemen the more as they insisted on arresting as many of the villagers as they could. But the policeman behind the shooting allegedly reported himself to the police authorities in Otukpo. He was said to have declared that he could not bring himself to accuse the villagers of a crime they did not commit.\nThe policeman was arrested and detained, then transferred to the Benue State Police Command headquarters in Makurdi where he was detained, pending his orderly room trial. In spite of truth about who shot the deceased policeman, the team that left the village only reinforced with more officers, soldiers and armed vigilante, and stormed the village later that day. The raid was unprecedented, according to the villagers, as they could not resist the large armed team that stormed their little village. Several villagers were arrested with others running into the forests. At the end of the day, many houses were allegedly burnt down and shops looted, creating a scenario of a village at war.\nAfter the raid, Mr. Obochi, a senior civil servant in Makurdi, but whose family land is part of the parcel in dispute, decided to meet the Senate President’s representatives in Otukpo. He was arrested and detained for one week, in Makurdi, along with those earlier arrested.\nObochi told Sunday Vanguard, in an interview in Makurdi, that what was happening in Asa III since the beginning of the year was a clear case of intimidation of the peasant farmers.\nHe said he was arrested in the process of trying to resolve the issue between the Mark group and his brothers and sisters in his village. According to him, “my offence was that I bailed those who were arrested by a combined team of policemen, soldiers and vigilante”.\nNarrating the situation, Obochi said, “The Mark group claims that the villagers are strangers and as such will not receive any compensation for the land and their crops. Rather, they said that compensation will be paid to Otukpo indigenous people. Their informants misled them. They told them that those farming on the land in question are ‘Aalala’”.\nThose referred to as ‘Aalala’ are those from south of Idomaland, especially Ogbadibo and Okpokwu Local Government Areas.\nObochi insisted that those who own the land and even currently own farms on the land in question are aboriginal Otukpo people.\nHe added that most of the houses destroyed and the looted shops belonged to indigenes of Asa III and not strangers which made it difficult for any reasonable member of the society to comprehend.\nObochi said the villagers had no intention of fighting Mark but that they won’t allow anyone to forcefully take away the land which they inherited from their ancestors.\nEffort to see Mark\nAsked if the aggrieved villagers made any effort to meet the Senate President in person, he said, “I met Adakole Elijah ( an aide of the Senate President) and requested to see Sen. Mark. He promised to facilitate my meeting him. That was before the arrest and that was the last time I saw the man. I also had a chance meeting with one Onyilokwu Ekwo (said to be very close to the Senate President) and I told him that we don’t want bloodshed in our village and that he should arrange a meeting for us to meet Mark. There was no response and I cannot just walk to Senator David Mark’s house”.\nAccording to Obochi, the demand of the owners of the farm land is, “the Senate President should follow due process by coming to the owners of the land. If a dirty man has something which you need, the person cannot look dirty to you.\n“He should come to us and make a request, then we will decide whether to give him the land or not; or give him part of the land; but certainly not the whole land as demarcated. We don’t have any personal problem with Mark He chose the wrong process. Those he is working with are not representatives of the farmers who own the land. He should stop further work on the land in question until the issue is resolved”.\nNeither the Senate President’s media team nor his family members responded to inquiries by Sunday Vanguard, in spite of repeated calls and text messages.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"http://www.vanguardngr.com/2013/07/blood-tears-in-oturkpo-as-david-marks-men-villagers-go-to-war/","2":"1920","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999713898"},{"0":"By Bunmi Sofola\nWHAT sort of buzz, drives a man to one-night-stand, relationships?

I had never given him the impression I fancied him.\n“I tried to beat him off but he was too strong. Unfortunately, my knickers were already round my ankles and he raped me there and then. He was out of the toilet before I knew what had happened! I felt so used and humiliated and when I got back to the party, I thought every-one would know what had happened to me.

You may have heard those stories of Europeans and Americans shaming fellow African passengers on the planes on their way back home: how stupid many African leaders are. They are so stupid, they sell themselves short, too cheap and beg out of what is rightly theirs.\nThe first story was some years ago about an American traveling out of Kenya. Then, there was another one out of Ghana. Later, others stories along the same line have come from Nigeria, Senegal and other African countries. The closest way to relate African politicians’ foolishness is how some school boys conspired with bursars to defraud their own poor hardworking fathers.\nAnother was personal. One of our “small” uncle visited a “big” uncle. Small uncle was served with drinks and a full pack of cigarettes. As the big uncle stepped into another room for a moment, our small uncle stole half of the cigarettes in the pack. When he finished his drinks, he stood up to go. Before he stepped outside, big uncle reminded him that he had forgotten his cigarettes: yepaa, I had been stealing from myself!\nThe embarrassment these oyibo subjected their fellow African passengers to paralyzed most. They did not know whether to laugh or cry at the “jokes”. Some Africans pretended to fall asleep with the hope that these oyibo people would stop since other people were listening. There is nothing these expatriates were bragging about that were not known or discussed in the African communities.\nIt is the glee with which foreign investors expressed the fact that they made a killing in their deals that is both embarrassing and annoying. You cannot fight them on the plane or counter what you know is true. One of them actually summarized African leaders’ negotiation skills to be stupidly selfish and dirt cheap: natural resources, land, royalties, tax-free zones, exorbitant finished imported products eagerly brought in with incredible concessions at tax-free zones and allowed to do whatever they want in Africa.\nWhat do these African leaders get back? Peanuts! Gold for mirrors like past century. Everything they get back is usually less than five percent of what is given away. Actually, they know African leaders are so greedily stupid, they usually keep back about one percent because they know Africans would come back to beg for less than one percent more, of the bargain. Once they are thrown the bones like dogs, they would dance and worship their foreign portfolio investors.\nPlease note that Congo is rightly renegotiating cobalt price with foreign investors. The fact is, most leaders have no idea or do not care about the value of what they are negotiating away. They go to their people and brag about how much foreign investments they bring into the country since nobody asks them how much is flying out of the country. When African experts lecture or write about business and economics, it is never from the perspectives of Africans.\nAll their authorities and quotes are from International Monetary Fund, World Bank and of course foreign universities. Any contrary opinion and authority inside or outside Africa like OXFAM that points out the one sided deals they negotiated for their countries is dangerous to their ability to get kickbacks in foreign currencies in their self-interests.\nAfrican and foreign businesses that generate sales outside each African country, are surprisingly the biggest looters of foreign reserves. If these companies are selling products like chocolates, coffee, beer, automobiles and cement outside their country, they should be a good source of foreign or hard currencies for their own government. No! They dip into limited foreign reserve locally, fighting for it like every Momoh, Emeka and Tunde or small businesses.\nWhat they promise is that by the year - when we are all dead and gone - they will be generating foreign cash for their home countries. Think about it. Those selling sugar and water in the name of Coca-Cola, Pepsi, Fanta etc. claim they need our limited foreign reserve to import sugar from our sugarcane and Pierre water that cannot be readily made available at home. So they have to obtain them with our foreign reserve, haba!\nThough ignoramus when they are negotiating with multinational corporations, when buying their finished products, they know these manufacturers make more money from after sales from maintenance and of course from training their own staff, not African staff on technical details. This was the bone of contention between the British and Americans in the early century when British accused Americans of stealing their innovations. Now it is the turn of American claiming Japan and China are stealing American innovations.\nWhen are Africans going to steal British, American, Japanese and Chinese technologies? If these leaders were not so book-educated like a robot, we would think they would play the same game after their Independence in the late fifties and sixties. Sometimes one has to wonder which is more painful, African telling our leaders daily that they are selfishly stupid or Asians, Europeans, Americans, Lebanese and Arabs telling us our leaders are a special case of morons.\nSomeone said Africans are good at diagnosing their problems when writing or out of power. Once they are put in the position of authority, they all mess up big time. This may be true in many cases. But please, give some credit to those that worked tooth and nail to make their countries better than we met it; against all odds. There are hard workers in every African country that will never be given the opportunity to rule, even if they contest.\nWe all know the hard workers, five different types of professors, the sincere and patriotic Africans in each country. It is unfair to claim that people you know and refused to elevate to the position of power are just rogues like the rest of them. You shun them and prefer to celebrate rogues and vagabonds that give you “stomach infrastructure” and foreign motors/bikes while stealing you blind. Do not lump everyone together. Respect the dignity of labor. Even as gutter cleaners and farmers, we all have a role to play in life. Everyone cannot be a politician.\nWhen Prof. Soludo said the Paris Club odious loan could have been negotiated better by anyone, it was not out of spite but out of indignation. We had two Obasanjo and two Audu Ogbe we know very well. On their first outing, they worked diligently for the country but left office almost bankrupt and were humiliated by people for going back home broke up to today.

Why can’t this government, if not that they are partisan, bring those people out for trial?” he asked, corroborating calls from several quarters for the Federal Government to make good its promise.\nHe claimed that the government has developed cold feet in fighting the insurgency because some of those backing Boko Haram are now top-ranking government officials.\n“I can’t come on air and start mentioning names of people that are presently in government that the boys we arrested mentioned,” he said, referencing his time as a member of the military intelligence team in 2017.\n“Some of them are governors now.

A man of excellent performance and integrity, analysts say Dakwambo could readily appeal to the electorate in the 2019 presidential election.\nPrior to the loss of the 2015 election by former President Goodluck Jonathan, allegations of fraud and manipulation hung on the neck of the PDP like the sword of Damocles.This was the more reason Nigerians elected to seek an alternative in the All Progressives Congress, APC. Now that the ruling party has demonstrated its inability to offer better governance, many people believe the PDP cannot afford to seek the trust of Nigerians with a candidate who is seen as not to be above board in the poll.\nIt is evident that the long suffering Nigerians have had enough of gerontocracy while majority of them are prepared to do away with this unworkable idea in 2019. What the nation needs at this time of untold economic hardship and insecurity is a young President who is fresh with new ideas and innovative concepts. This appears the only path to tread if the country is to experience true progress beyond 2019. PDP being the major opposition party could not have hoped for a better opportunity and time to return to power than now. Dakwambo, a man of proven record of achievements and who has never had an appointment with any of the anti-corruption agencies, can get the votes of Nigerians in any presidential poll.\nThe great, 55, would have only turned 57 by 2019. Our youths who dominate the nation’s population must resolve never to submit the leadership of this country to any man whose age is above 70 years. The youths need to wake up from their slumber and rescue this nation from retrogression with their votes in the forthcoming election. The ruling class comprising mostly of the elders has held the nation down for too long and there cannot be a better time to rescue her from their firm grip than now. The elders have been given all the chances but they simply cannot give what they do not have. Their lack of modern ideas and innovative concepts has sadly manifested in their archaic policy plans that have consigned the nation’s developmental vehicle to a permanent reverse gear.\nAside the fact that Dakwambo is a relatively young man, he is also roundly experienced, exposed and educated. He is educated to the level of PhD and passed through the qualifying examinations of seven professional bodies. He was awarded the membership of the professional institutions after attaining success in their examinations. He is BSc holder from Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria where he graduated with second class upper division in accounting. The result was the best obtained by any individual in then Bauchi State at the time the governor graduated from the institution. He is also a holder of master’s degree in economics from University of Lagos and a post graduate diploma in computer science from Delta State University Abraka. He obtained his PhD from Igbinedion University, Okada.\nThe career achievements of Dakwambo in the private and public sectors is another major attribute that cut him out as the ideal presidential candidate of the PDP. He began his glowing career at the Coopers and Lybrand International, now PriceWaterHouseCoopers, as a chartered accountant from 1985 to 1988. It is on record that he became a chartered accountant at a record time of one year after his graduation from the university. He later joined the Central Bank of Nigeria in 1988 and worked with the apex bank until 1999 when then Governor Abubakar Habu Hashidu appointed him as the Accountant General of Gombe State . From there, former President Olusegun Obasanjo appointed him as the Accountant General of the Federation in 2005. Before this, Dankwambo had served in various committees on the Federation Account where his resourcefulness became evident.\nIt was during Dakwambo’s tenure as Accountant General of the Federation the he introduced the Integrated Payroll Personnel Information System (IPPIS). Central payment of salaries of staff in all the ministries, departments and agencies using an automated system was also introduced. He was part of the revolution in the public sector that brought e-payment system.The use of cheques has since been eliminated in the government transactions at the federal level. Courtesy of this innovation, contractors, staff and service providers now get their accounts credited automatically through e-payment. He also ensured that the financial statements of the federal government which were in arrears were brought up to date, prepared, audited and published before he left office.\nDakwambo equally completed the Treasury House. The Treasury House stands out today in Abuja as one of the most magnificent edifices.\nIt was against the backdrop of these achievements that he contested the governorship of Gombe in 2011 and the story of the state changed dramatically on his assumption of office. He was recently adjudged the best performing governor in the northern part of the country. In his first four years in office, he revolutionized agriculture in Gombe. He procured 225 tractors and constructed several markets to encourage cotton farming in the state. Dakwambo has practically turned around the fortune of education in Gombe. He constructed over 502 classrooms and recruited well over 1,000 degree and NCE graduates to teach students among other achievements in education.\nThe solid credentials Dakwambo has earned in the public and private sectors will obviously speak for him in the contest for the PDP presidential ticket and it will amount to a disservice to Nigerians who are yearning for effective leadership, after the APC administration has failed them, if the party allows this opportunity to slip away. PDP needs not look beyond Dakwambo if it expects Nigerians to submit their collective destiny to it in 2019.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"https://www.vanguardngr.com/2017/12/pdp-dakwambo-2019/","2":"1226","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999504089"},{"0":"Stand out from the crowd, build brand authority, and instill trust with your customers.

But it would happen if they remain tenacious.\nSo, although the youth generation would make significant impact in 2023 elections ,as l had enunciated in my media intervention widely published on 21 June, 2022 titled:Converting Youth Bulge To Positive Force For Politics in Nigeria,my prognosis then is that either Turaki Atiku Abubakar or Asiwaju Bola Tinubu would prevail in the upcoming presidential contest. And that position has undergone further adjustment.\nIn any case, one of the three of them would be the one to receive the hand over notes from president Buhari on 29th May 2023.\nAnd l can fortell what the policies and programs of the duo, perhaps a trio, would look like when one of them takes over the reins of governance.\nBasically,most of what is known about them and which l will rely on in my analysis are derived from their period of stewardship or time in public office .\nWith respect to Tinubu,he has served for two terms as governor of lagos state from 1999 to 2007 and left footprints with respect to spreading his political tentacles nationally after he co-founded the now defunct Action Congress of Nigeria, ACN, and he has made significant efforts at providing infrastructure that has steered lagos state towards becoming a mega city, which remains unsurpassed.\nRegarding Abubakar that was Vice President to former president Olusegun Obasanjo, who also served from 1999 to 2007, he has giant imprints in both the terrains of politics and economy nationwide.\nLeveraging the network of People Democratic Movement,PDM,inherited from his mentor,late Shehu Musa Yar’adua, he is easily one of the most widely known political actors in Nigeria. Apart from serving as Vice President, 1999-2007, he has contested for the presidency of Nigeria a whooping five (5) times with significant impart nationwide.\nFor that reason, the PDP candidate is believed to already have in his kitty about 13 million voters which he earned during his last contest for the office of president in 1999 with incumbent president,Mohammadu Buhari who received a couple of millions more votes than him.\nI will not dwell much on Peter Obi because everything about his service in public office,including documents that are supposed to be classified,plus the ones concocted by the denizens swirling around in his orbit or netizens that have colonized the cyberspace on behalf of Obi are already over exposed in the public domain.\nSo,without further ado,it is pertinent that we get down to the brass tacks by shining the light on the private sector background of the likely candidates that would become president of Nigeria next year.\nIn any case,with the economy and security likely to occupy the left and center of the political debate when Independent National Election Commission,INEC, officially opens the space for campaigning on 28th September,Bola Tinubu and Atiku Abubakar who are thankfully not economic illiterates would be going head-to-head.\nRemarkably ,the terrific and encouraging thing about the candidates is that both of the APC and PDP candidates, Bola Tinubu and Atiku Abubakar respectively, plus the LP candidate Peter Obi can read the balance sheet because they are all business savvy, having been private sector practitioners.\nWhile Tinubu is an accountant, with interest in tax collection,Atiku is an astute entrepreneur with investments in oil/gas as well as education, while Obi is a commodity trader.\nFor lack of space and time , we will not going into granular details about their businesses.\nNow,Tinubu’s supporters would aver that it is his blue print for the development of Lagos state that has remained the play book that has been subsequently been relied upon by three governors-Babatunde Fashola, Akinkunmi Ambode and Jide Sanwo-Olu-for the advancement of the state.\nBy the same token,the former Vice President Atiku Abubakar shares in the credit for the giant developmental strides taken in our country under the presidency of Olusegun Obasanjo for eight (8) years . It was during that period that Nigeria’s debilitating debt burden of about $30 billion(which has reportedly sadly tanked up to an estimated $90 billion under the present regime) was substantially written off ($12billion) by the Paris Club of creditors. It was also a time that Nigeria witnessed economic reforms including privatization of public utilities such as the telecommunications sector that ushered in the current mobile telephone revolution.\nAnd there are credible reasons to believe that if president Obasanjo had succeeded in serving a third term (as pundits aver that he was desirous of doing) the petroleum sector would also have been privatized.\nThat means that Nigerians would not have been going through the agony of paying for the commodity literally through their nose, and basically going through hell and back to even find the commodity to purchase, an ordeal they are currently grappling with.\nSo inevitably ,the candidates that would likely emerge as president are pro-private sector and therefore likely to be able to pull Nigerian economy out of the abyss where it is currently mired due particularly to the monumental and unprecedented levels of insecurity in the country and poor economic policy decisions ,especially petroleum subsidy which is expected to gulp about four (4) trillion naira in budget 2022 , broken down as approximately N600 billion naira monthly expenditure,and still counting.\nBefore dwelling further on the likely economic policies of the potential Aso Rock Villa occupant after president Buhari exits next year, it is appropriate that we underline the qualities that Nigerians expect in their next president.\nDuring the launch of my new book: Becoming President Of Nigeria.A Citizen’s Guide, the keynote speaker, professor Mike Ikhariale, a Harvard University trained constitutional lawyer, outlined some qualities that an ideal president of Nigeria is supposed to posses in addition to the requirements in the 1999 constitution of the federal republic of Nigeria.\nThe expert in constitutionalism laid it bare by leveraging the work of an authority in constitutionalism, James Barber.\nHere is how he put it:\n“According to James Barber in his studies generally referred to as “Barber’s Research”, he laid out about 10 essential qualities which a President must possess in order to be successful. They include:\na. A strong vision for the country’s future supported by a plan of action.\nb. He must have the ability to put his own reign in historical perspective.\nc. A president must be a communicator who knows the importance of the so-called ‘Bullying Pulpit’.\nd. He must be prepared to make unpopular decisions, someone who is able to move beyond the orthodoxy and purposefully innovative.\ne. Must have crisis management skills, not passing the puck but accepting realities.\nf. Must be a person of remarkable character and integrity.\ng. Even though he has the constitutional power to hire and fire, he must make his key appointments wisely in such a way that he can use his employment prerogative to bolster his own political reach. This in modern times would mean gender balance and in the particular case of Nigeria, the requirements of Federal Character principle. He must avoid cronyism and nepotism.\nh. Must have the ability to relate with the Legislators,\ni. Needless to say, that charisma and a welcoming aura are great assets for a President.”\nHaving arrayed the qualities of an ideal president, the question now is: does the antecedents of the two candidates of the ruling party APC – Bola Tinubu and main opposition party, PDP -Atiku Abubakar and the distant third candidate, Peter Obi of LP , who are the front runners in the race to Aso Rock Villa, indicate that they posses most or all of the qualities enunciated in ‘Barber’s Research’ earlier cited by professor Ikhariale?\nIf readers would indulge me, l would like to respond to the forgoing poser against the backdrop of the public office records of the candidates that l earlier highlighted.\nAs l pointed out ab initio, it is Tinubu of APC that successfully steered lagos state into becoming a functional mega city and of which a coterie of his protégé has continued to hold sway.\nOn the other hand , it is Abubakar of PDP that set the agenda for leap frogging the economic growth of Nigeria when during their first tenure in Aso Rock Villa ,then president Olusegun Obasanjo, entrusted him with the management of the economy during which the privatization of the telecommunications sector,(held up as a global model for privatization) led to the introduction of GSM telephony amongst other positive phenomenons that occurred in the Obasanjo/Abubakar era.\nIt is also worthy of note that both Tinubu and Abubakar have the knack for identifying talents, by spotting and reaching out to them, even if they are in the private sector. Hence the duo often achieved commendable levels of success in leadership in their assignments in public office .\nAs for Peter Obi, he attracted a brewery to the Anambra state and took a stake in it as well as saved N75 billion naira which he left behind for his hand picked successor, Willie Obiano in banks, one of which is fidelity bank,where he is a major share holder, and Obiano was once an executive director before Obi made him governor of Anambra state in 2014.\nWhile being cognizant of the blithe on the characters of both Bola Tinubu and Atiku Abubakar based on recent scathing reports by Financial Times of London and Bloomberg news that alleged that they have been indicted for corruption in the USA; it is noteworthy that the frontline presidential candidates were never convicted of the crimes that they were alleged to have committed.\nNonetheless, there have been a lot of buzz locally about their character flaws which frankly, can not be discountenanced.\nBut at the same time, we must recognize that no man is perfect.\nPersonally, if l am faced with the option of choosing between an economic illiterate who would do nothing to grow the economy because he is not trained to do so,and rather dissipates a lot of energy in chasing perceived corrupt people to no avail ; or save up the income of government in bank accounts instead of investing it in employment and tax generating ventures that would boost the GDP and living standard of Nigerians: l would choose the alternative which is an enterprising personality that would seek out all possible legitimate ways to improve the economy and also make our country a better place, prosperity wise and socioculturally for harmonious co-existence of the multiple ethnic and religion groups.\nThe mindset expressed above is underscored by the parable of the three talents in the holy Bible? Those familiar with the parable would recall that the story is about three servants who were entrusted with talents (funds) by their master prior to embarking on a long trip. And the two who invested their talents wisely, were commended by their master upon his return.\nBut the one who dug up the ground to hide his own talent,so that he would return same to his master was chided and the talent was taken off him and given to those who invested the funds left in their care.\nIn the light of the above,if a personality with the ability and capacity to robustly grow the beleaguered economy of our beloved country and has engaged in the risky venture of trying to stimulate growth via transactions,and have in the process been accused of graft in the past,both here in Nigeria and abroad without conviction,so be it; because regardless of their past, so long as such candidates are not ex-convicts who the Nigerian constitution excludes from running for public office,l would chose the latter than the former.\nAs we all may be aware,by and large,risk is an integral part of business or transactions and graft is always in the mix. Accordingly, the most efficacious panacea to graft is to set up robust institutions to prevent it.\nCertainly, not of the hue of EFCC and ICPC, thank you very much.\nIncorporating measures to eliminate corruption is akin to organizations , (particularly banking institutions) building firewalls around their data bases to fend off cyber criminals that are constantly seeking ways to breach the security of corporations in order to gain access and steal vital data of targeted organizations.\nSo it behoves of the legislature and judiciary to enact and enforce laws that would prevent corruption.That is what is obtainable in advanced democracies.\nAnd l make bold to state that the position that l have espoused above would not be far from the mindset of private sector practitioners most of whom are already echoing such sentiment because it is in tandem with their belief that the economy should be unshackled especially by ending petrol subsidy.\nWe need not be rocket scientists to figure out that the reason for seeking a president that has business attitude is that the better part of seven years of this administration invested in anti corruption misadventure has pulled, not only the economy of our country into a black hole, but the fabric of unity of our country has also been shredded to the extent that it would take a very long time to mend.\nAnd that is not a good thing ,no matter how spin doctors working for government try to white wash the dire atmosphere in our country which is basically comparable to the experience of a patient in an Intensive Care Unit,ICU of a hospital where life is so precarious that it is only a tiny thread separating life and death.\nSo,despite the false claim that our country is better off than what it was seven years ago,majority of Nigerians recognize such revisionism as sheer farce and deceit of the electorate , as such they are resolved to effect change, if the current activism by our youths engaged in Permanent Voters Card,PVC registration and collection, is anything to go by.\nAlthough,somehow unorthodox,my non nihilistic or liberal assessment of both Bola Tinubu and Atiku Abubakar as well as Peter Obi ,is guided by the truism and conventional wisdom , ‘ there is no paean without pain’.\nThat broadly implies that sacrifices must be made in order to achieve success.\nBuoyed by that reality,l am convinced that Nigerians are willing to vote for the candidate who would move the nation forward into the orbit of progress and prosperity,than those that would lead them into a blind alley and quagmire where the ship of state is currently anchored and waiting to ,at the slightest stress test, tip over or remain moored in a cul de sac where it is currently located ,rudderless .\nIn that regard, and for sure ,Tinubu, Abubakar and Obi will receive caustic criticisms when emotions start running high as the campaigns begin from 28 September which is basically a couple of months from today.\nBut one thing we must recognize is that things are never as bad as they first seem or as good as they first seem.\nSo,after the anticipated hurly burly, one of them would end up in Aso Rock Villa on 29 May 2023 and that person will be adept in reading and understanding profit and loss account a skill that is critically needed for the robust management of our country especially at a point like this when it is on the verge of bankruptcy.\nAnd l would like to urge skeptics who hold contrary view to the assertion above,to recall the gale of criticisms that was visited on then candidate,Mohammadu Buhari when he was a presidential candidate in 2015. Yet,he won the presidency, simply because there was a pervasive sanctimonious attitude of ‘anyone but Goodluck Jonathan’ prevailing in Nigeria at that point in time.\nIt is trite to state that a similar sentiment is currently prevailing in Nigeria’s political space, as Nigerians are craving a rebirth or reset in 2023.\nApart from the candidates of APC and PDP that are besmeared, Peter Obi, candidate of Labor Party, LP, who is a two term governor of Anambra state also had corruption toga tied to his persona .That is if the huge cash running into hundreds of millions of naira (about N250m )allegedly found in a vehicle in the governors mansion Awka during his tenure is taking into account. And it is in addiction to the alleged malfeasance arising from his patronage of an offshore tax heaven that reportedly helped him hide some of his wealth that he failed to disclose, to avoid tax in Nigeria.\nSimilarly ,the presidential candidate of the newly minted party, New Nigerian Peoples Party, NNPP Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso,who is a two term governor of Kano state, ex defense minister and senator of the federal republic of Nigeria has also at one time or the other been tarred with the black brush of malfeasance which was brought to the fore in the course of his duel with his predecessors and successors as governor of Kano state, lbrahim Shekarau and Abdulahi Ganduje.\nBut most of the candidates have gone to the law courts shorn themselves of such moral liabilities.\nMy point is that unlike in 2015,anti corruption will not be the center piece of any candidate’s campaign,since it has been demystified as a campaign rhetoric that would resonate with voters. In any case must of the candidates have shed the negative toga of corruption by discharging themselves of the allegations in courts of law.\nIn short ,right now ,there is fatigue on the fight against corruption because those who are supposed to be fighting it in the current dispensation have become more corrupt than those they are supposed to prevent from dipping their hands into our common treasury.\nThat is reflected by the allegations against lbrahim Magu ,the anti graft tzar who was recently sacked as the EFCC chairman and the immediate past Accountant General of The Federation, AGF, Ahmed Idris who got dismissed on account of bilking Nigeria of N80 billion naira diverted illegally from the treasury that he is supposed to be the custodian.\nAlso in the mix is Abdulrasheed Maina, the jailed chairman of Pension Reform Task Team , PRTT with responsibility for the reforming the corruption ridden pension funds system and he ended up re-looting the multi billion naira funds that he was assigned to recover.\nBe it Omoyele Sowore, the presidential candidate of Africa Action Congress, AAC, Dumebi Kachikwu , candidate for the presidency on the platform of Africa Democratic Congress, ADC or Young Progressive Party, YPP presidential candidate, Malik Ado-lbrahim , all of whom are running on the platforms of fringe political parties,not one presidential candidates is a saint by any stretch of imagination as they all also have scandals,not particularly of fraud or corruption dimensions,hugging them.\nAnd from 28 September, all of them would probably be literally stripped naked simply because muck raking goes with the territory of politics.\nAs salvaging the economy and reining in insecurity are obviously the most pressing needs of Nigerians in these present times , projecting into the development mindset of the next occupant of Aso Rock Villa seat of power as president in 2023, l am pretty convinced that if there were to be a three point agenda as a fulcrum or policy plank of the incoming government;one of them would be pulling our country out of economic doldrums which has seen government borrowing money from local banks to pay public servants salaries and utilizing about 98% of it’s income for debt servicing,and which by some accounts is in excess of ninety (90) billion dollars borrowed from local and international lenders.\nAlso , restoring security of lives and properties by government thus freeing the masses from the rule of bandits such as religious insurgents, herdsmen militias and unknown gun men currently be-spoiling Nigeria from the north, all the way down to the eastern corners of Nigeria ,as precious lives are being decimated with reckless abandon on a daily basis,would be the second in the agenda.\nThe third in the agenda would be to drastically cut down corruption which has become so entrenched in our political space and business environment that it is looking like it is embedded in our DNA and therefore part of our culture. Of course that is a false narrative that must be erased from the psyche of Nigerians.\nNow, PDP presidential candidate,Atiku Abubakar had picked his running mate shortly after the primaries.\nAlthough his choice of delta state governor, lfeanyi Okowa has been tempestuous, largely because the preferred candidate of PDP leadership and follower-ship appears to be governor of Rivers state,Nyesom Wike, who although is the presidential aspirant that garnered the next highest vote after the winner; and a veritable pillar of support for the PDP in the past seven years;got passed over for appointment as Abubakar’s running mate. That anomaly has precipitated the rumble that has culminated into the ongoing resistance by southern governors and key stakeholders in the main opposition party which still persists till date .\nAnd that glitch could slow down the otherwise fast moving train that had gathered the momentum for PDP to return to Aso Rock Villa after its unceremonious exit in 2015.\nPDP’s case is not as bad as that of the ruling party, APC where it’s candidate has taken more or less one month (8th June to 10th July) to pick a running mate.\nTinubu took long in choosing his running mate, Kashim Shetima, former Borno State governor and a fellow Muslim owing to the dilemma of being a southern Muslim who must nominate a running mate from the north, where incidentally, Muslims are in the majority.\nWith a Muslim-Muslim ticket ,Tinubu and the ruling party have a monumental and Herculean task of convincing southern and northern Christians to vote for him as president in 2023. That standpoint is simply derived from the fact that Christians have long been feeling marginalized under president Buhari’s watch,which although had a Christian Vice President in the person of Yemi Osinbajo, yet suffered exclusion from governance. How much more worse would it get ,if no Christian would be at the table inside Aso Rock Villa seat of presidential power from 2023,they may wonder. Tinubu seemed to have been left with no better option. The devil or deep blue sea.\nAnd it is the type of choice dilemma that Bukola Saraki could have been faced with, if was to have won the presidential primaries in PDP.\nOf all the major political parties,only the LP and it’s presidential candidate seem to have gotten the ethnic and religious balancing equation right.\nThat is simply because Peter Obi, the presidential candidate of the party, a Christian from Anambra state has picked Datti Baba-Ahmed a Muslim from Kaduna state. It is such a perfect combination in the ethno-religious calculus reminiscent of the Shehu Shagari and Alex Ekwueme combination in 1979 that it looking like a de-ja-vu.\nMuch as the pairing of President and vice Presidential candidates of labor party is an ideal combination,it is not really a critical factor, but it matters.\nThat is why a Muslim-Muslim ticket that Bola Tinubu has settled for is rubbing off roughly on members of the other faiths.\nApplying the analogy of a game of gulf, the APC Presidential candidate, Tinubu’s dilemma can be likened to a player who has hit the ball and it has fallen into a stream in the golf course which is a major bogey ; while Abubakar’s situation is like that of a player whose ball was struck with the club but it has landed in a bunker or bogey; just as LP’s candidate, Obi looks like a player that has made a powerful hit of the ball and it has landed out of the range of the hole, such that it is highly unlikely to be successfully potted into the hole in the number of times required by the rules of the game.\nIn conclusion,my take is that the PDP candidate, Atiku Abubakar has a better chance of potting the ball out of the bunker into the hole, if he is able to calm the brewing Wike storm swiftly and dexterously. PDP situation is still better than the circumstances in which APC candidate,Bola Tinubu find’s himself. He is highly handicapped as his ball has landed in a stream and he will likely not be able to retrieve it.\nThat simply means that his presidential quest may be in jeopardy of being dead on arrival after choosing his running mate, since a Muslim-Muslim ticket which worked in 1993 when Moshood Abiola,a Muslim philanthropist from the south west,like him, paired up with Babagana Kingibe,also a Muslim from Borno state to win the presidential contest in 1993 that is acclaimed to be the fairest and freest in the annals of Nigeria’s electioneering process.\nToday, in light of the polarization of the country along ethnic and religious divides in the past decade or so, such a prospect now looks like an anathema in Nigeria where a stanza in the old national anthem “ … though tribe and tongue may differ, in brotherhood we stand … appear to be so quaint and such an anathema due to the elevated level of politics of religiosity and ethnicity that have engulfed the political space and obfuscated the brotherhood spirit of yore.\nFor the reasons above ,APC and it’s Presidential torch bearer, Bola Tinubu have a perfect storm in their hands and Atiku Abubakar and PDP baring any more goofs or gaffes may be on the verge of singing joyfully into Aso Rock Villa.\nMagnus onyibe, an entrepreneur, public policy analyst ,author, development strategist, alumnus of Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, Tufts University, Massachusetts, USA and a former commissioner in Delta state government, sent this piece from lagos.\nTo continue with this conversation, pls visit www.magnum.ng\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"http://www.vanguardngr.com/2015/06/i-was-afraid-nigeria-might-be-like-somalia-says-buhari/Thankfully","2":"6178","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999923706"},{"0":"The Kwara State House of Assembly on Tuesday passed an amendment bill halting payment of pension to former governors, deputy governors and other officers holding political offices after their tenure in office.\nThe passage of the bill followed the consideration of the report of the House Committee on Establishment and Public Service at the Committee of the Whole House sitting in Ilorin.\nThe motion for the passage of the bill was moved by the Deputy House Leader, Segilola Abdulkadir and was unanimously adopted by members.\nThe Deputy Speaker, Matthew Okedare, who presided over the plenary, directed the Clerk of the House, Alhaji Mohammed Katsina, to prepare clean copy of the bill for governor’s assent.\nThe bill, which was forwarded to the House by Gov.

They had difficulty.”\nLagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry Director-General Muda Yusuf said although the private sector was paying above the current minimum wage, “there may be different challenges for the SMEs as they may adopt different models for engagement. Rather than keep all the staff, they may rationalise them by inviting only those that they need at a particular time. The big corporations have nothing to worry about as they are already paying the minimum wage.”\nHe praised the government for working successfully with the private sector and labour to arrive at an acceptable figure and averting a strike.\nWorkers were jubilating over the new wage.

NFF boss\nA Federal High Court, Abuja, on Thursday, restrained the Minister of Youth and Sports, Sunday Dare, and President, Nigeria Football Federation (NFF), Amaju Pinnick from conducting the NFF executive election scheduled for Sept. 30 in Edo.\nJustice Inyang Ekwo, in a ruling on an ex-parte motion moved by counsel for the claimants, Celsus Ukpong, ordered the the minister, Mr Pinnik or any person, acting on their instruction, to maintain a status quo pending the hearing and determination of the motion on notice for interlocutory injunction.\n“Counsel for the claimants informed the court that the defendants are taking action that will adversely affect the subject matter of this case.\n“Parties are hereby ordered to maintain status quo ante pending final order of this court,” he ruled.\nJustice Ekwo then reverted the matter to Oct. 31 for hearing.\nThe News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that, in the motion marked: FHC/ABJ/CS/1376/2021, Harrison Jalla, Chief Victor Rumson Baribote, Austin Popo and National Association of Nigerian Footballers (NANF) are 1st to 4th claimants respectively.\nIn the application dated and filed on Sept. 2, NFF, Pinnick and the minister are 1st to 3rd defendants respectively.\nIn the motion, the claimants’ sought an interim order restraining the defendants, his agent, employees, staff, officials or electoral committee from organising or conducting any election into any executive office of the NFF pending the hearing and determination of the motion on notice for interlocutory injunction.\nIn the affidavit in support of the motion deposed to by Fayenengigha Jacob, a lawyer in the chamber of Ukpong, he said the defendants had been served with processes in the case and that NFF and Pinnick had entered appearance in the matter, while the minister, though served with court papers, he had not entered appearance.\nJacob averred that one of the complaints in the matter was the undemocratic manner in which the NFF was being constituted resulting in depriving the majority of the stakeholders and members of the NFF from having a say or contributing to the development of football in Nigeria.\nAccording to him, the glory of Nigeria football has nosedived as a result of its undemocratic manner of the leadership of the said body.\nHe said the complainants were deliberately excluded from the last congress held in Lagos for no just reason.\n“That the claimant had legitimately call on the leadership of the said body to set machinery in motion to amend the 2010 NFF statute that was manipulated to deprive the majority of the NFF members such as the Professional Football Association, the league, the coaches body and the players from participating in any election let alone of winning same.\n“That the said leadership of the NFF, the 2nd defendant (Pinnick), his agents, privies refused or neglected to allow the due process to take place in amending the said 2010 NFF statute,” he said\nJacob said while this matter is still pending in court the defendants are going ahead to announce and purportedly try to organise and conduct an election of the said body in September, 2022.\nHe said the defendants had been served with the motion on notice for interlocutory injunction to restrain them from conducting any election into the executive offices of NFF until after the hearing and determination of the substance matter,\nAccording to him, while the motion on notice for interlocutory order restraining the defendants from disturbing the res in the matter, the defendants have drawn out a time table and set up an electoral committee to conduct an election to the offices in question on Friday 30th September, 2022 in Benin City Edo State.\nHe said the substance of the matter would be defeated should the said

Yahaya Bello\nBy Olasunkanmi Akoni\nAt least 600 women groups, drawn from different parts of the country have concluded plans to converge on Abuja next week Tuesday, in a solidarity walk for Governor Yahaya Bello of the Kogi State presidential quest.\nThe solidarity walk is tagged, “One Million Women March for GYB”.\nOperating under the auspices of Women United For Yahaya Bello (WUYABEL), the women groups, including Non-Governmental Organisations, civil society organisations, religious, professional bodies, women in media, politics, market women as well as top women entrepreneurs, among others, will storm Abuja to drum support for the Governor, ahead of 2023 presidential election.\nAccording to the organisers, the women groups, having come to the obvious conclusion that the nation requires one with pedigree, youthfulness and capacity to succeed incumbent President Muhammadu Buhari, have taken it upon themselves to collectively canvas support for Bello, who they said had demonstrated the ability to resolve the myriads of challenges confronting Nigeria.\nThe Global Coordinator of WUYABEL, Dr Hanatu Adeeko who announced this in Abuja, explained that the gathering will be the first of its kind “especially now that the political stage is almost set”.\nAccording to the women of a substance across key sectors of the Nigerian economy, “Bello, as governor, has redefined governance in Kogi State with sterling and verifiable performance, especially in the areas of women and youth empowerment, poverty alleviation programs, massive infrastructure development, and health care delivery among others,”\nDr Adeeko, a Physician, said, “He (Governor Bello) has empowered and supported women to grow. No state in Nigeria has given more positions to women than Kogi. And sincerely, the state is getting it right in critical areas. We want to encourage other Governors to walk the talk by standing with that one Governor that has made us proud. Governor Yahaya Bello must know that once he has women on his side, he can go to sleep. We believe in his capacity and will make it happen.\n“This will be the first in a long while that women on their own will come together in their numbers to speak with one voice.\n“We are coming to Abuja to demand that the status quo must be changed. This is the time for us to yield power to younger people, especially those who have given a good account of themselves in other places they’ve rendered service.\n“We have observed closely the people that are showing interest in the presidency and if we continue to keep quiet, the change we desire may not manifest. This is the reason different women groups are coming to Abuja to say it loud and clear that it is Yahaya Bello or nobody,” he stated.\nThe organisers further expressed optimism that Bello’s presidency would usher in a breath of fresh air while asking Nigerians from all walks of life to support the project as it would be “a clear departure from the old order.”\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"https://www.vanguardngr.com/2022/01/2023-600-women-groups-to-stage-one-million-women-march-for-yahaya-bello/","2":"669","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.999874115"},{"0":"The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, yesterday arrested the duo of Moghalu Maduakonam and Esho Femi David at the Nnamdi Azikwe International Airport, Abuja for attempting to smuggle $240,000 out of the country.\nWhile Maduakonam was travelling to Dubai, United Arab Emirates with $200,000.00 which he failed to declare;

In 2004, the Niger Delta was aflame with conflict. Asari, Ateke Tom and Tompolo were waging a fierce war against the Nigerian federal and state governments. Many people had been killed.\nNigerian military were having trouble contending with Asari’s guerrilla warfare. Small, highly mobile and heavily armed militant forces in fast boats struck across the Niger Delta targeting oil installations and military posts. Nigeria’s oil output at one point dropped to as low as 600,000 barrels per day and on average was halved to one million barrels per day.\nThis was a devastating blow to Nigeria’s economy and the operations of the major international oil companies. Apart from the economic impact, communities were suffering from the conflict with many innocent people killed in military efforts to purge the communities of militants.\nMy wife and I were living in Port Harcourt and, in 2004, I explored the idea of a peace deal with an Ijaw friend, Von Kemedi. As an Ijaw, he knew Asari who was also Ijaw. Von was able to make contact with Asari who agreed to meet with me.\nVon and I subsequently travelled through the swamps in a speed boat to Opurata village to see the damage to villages before transferring to a canoe that we paddled to another village from where we were met by Asari’s men in another fast boat. With a blindfold on we were taken to another island where we waited until another boat escorted us to Asari’s camp. A vigorous discussion took place that night surrounded by Asari’s well-armed fighters. By the end of the night, the foundation of a peace deal has been set down.\nI subsequently took the peace proposal to President Olusegun Obasanjo and found him ready and willing to support peace and disarmament. The deal also encompassed demobilisation and a programme to reintegrate the militants back into the communities. This required a skills training programme which President Obasanjo supported. A final essential element was weapons surrender and destruction. The protocol used was that set down by the UN and was agreed by both sides.\nAt the Villa\nI stayed in close contact with Asari by satellite phone each evening around 5pm. We worked out the details of the peace process. The first step was a ceasefire. The ceasefire was set in place on September 8, 2004, but in the following days was broken three times and each time it was the Nigerian military that broke the ceasefire. Even when under fire during a ceasefire breach Asari, honoured his word and withdrew, firing only for self-protection.\nTo complete the peace deal, President Obasanjo directed me to oversee the extraction of Asari and his key commanders in September 2004. I travelled to the Niger Delta with a handful of SSS men headed by Fubara Duke, an Ijaw man known to Asari and trusted by President Obasanjo.\nAt 1am on September 29, 2004 Asari, and his commanders met us at Abonnema Landing in the Niger Delta and we proceeded to Port Harcourt airport where we boarded a plane at dawn to take us to Abuja and direct to President Obasanjo in the Cabinet Room. That day was punctuated with amazing revelations as Asari recounted events that led him and his men to defy the government and launch a guerrilla style campaign.\nAsari always kept his word to me. He gave me an undertaking on the ceasefire and kept it even in the face of breaches by the military. When it came to time for weapons surrender, he asked me how many weapons I wanted him to surrender. I said, ‘ Asari you have 3,000 men, so I want 3,000 weapons.’\nAsari gave a commitment to hand over 3,000 guns, 100 general purpose machine guns and some rocket launchers which were subsequently destroyed in a series of public destructions to UN standards overseen by the Army at Bori Military Camp in Port Harcourt in mid-November 2004.\nPresident Obasanjo kept his word and on October 1, 2004 the peace accord was announced and Asari and his commanders returned to the Niger Delta.\nAsari is correct is saying I never paid him anything. I never paid anyone and no one paid me either by way of funds or favours. President Obasanjo did not offer to pay me for the Niger Delta peace accord and I did not seek payment. The peace deal was built on trust. I went to Asari’s camp unarmed and without any security.\nAsari and his key commanders travelled with me and the small SSS contingent totally unarmed. We trusted each other with our lives and that built trust. There can be no peace without trust. Without trust, there is merely a ceasefire which will eventually be broken and the fighting resume.\nAsari said in his interview with the Daily Post that President Obasanjo broke his word. I am not so sure of that. What I think Asari may be referring to is the demobilisation and skills training that did not materialise after the peace accord. Funds were to be set aside to train the ex-militants for employment and to reintegrate them back into their communities. This phase of the work was to be undertaken by the state governors.\nBy March 2005, a full six months had passed without any sign of training and reintegration. It was no surprise then to find 200 Niger Delta ex-militants had been recruited by foreign mercenaries to participate in a coup attempt in Equatorial Guinea. The ex-militants were intercepted as they departed Warri in a ship bound for Guinea. They had each been promised $5,000 and an AK47.\nHad the promised skills training and reintegration been implemented, these young men probably would not have agreed to join the coup attempt in Equatorial Guinea. So Asari is right but it was more likely that the governors were not sincere and not former President Obasanjo. It was the governors that had armed, promoted and used the gangs for political purposes in much the same way that former Governor Modu Sheriff was alleged to have done in Borno State..\nIt was this failure to honour the agreement to demobilise by providing skills training and reintegration that fuelled discontent and provided the conditions that formed MEND which added bombing and kidnapping to its mode of operation.\nContrary to Asari’s understanding, former President Obasanjo did not bring me to Nigeria on my recent trip to seek the release of the Chibok girls or for any other purpose. Nor did President Jonathan or anyone else. I came to Nigeria in April this year to seek the release of the Chibok girls at my own expense and of my own volition because I could see no progress on the release of the kidnapped girls.\nGirls horrifying rape\nWhile Asari may not believe any girls were kidnapped, let me assure you that hearing the stories of some girls who have escaped from Boko Haram camps is a sobering experience. There are many girls who have been kidnapped apart from the girls from the Chibok school.\nThe kidnapping of girls by Boko Haram has been going on for at least a year. Initially Boko Haram kidnapped girls because the fighters could not go back home to their wives. They used the kidnapped girls. Girls tell how they were raped every day, week after week.\nOne girl was raped every day, sometimes several times a day by groups of men. Some did not survive the ordeal. The escaped girls tell harrowing stories of rape and abuse. They are traumatised and require medical treatment and counselling. These girls are testament to the horrifying truth about the kidnappings.\nBut the Chibok kidnappings were only the start of my recent journey to Nigeria. It soon became apparent the (alleged) sponsors did not want any interference in their plan. The “political Boko Haram” which (allegedly) started out as Sheriff’s ECOMOG (so named after the military peace keeping forces operating in Liberia at that time because an SDP – Social Democratic Party- candidate was protected from an angry mob in Bama by a group of youths supporting the SDP) that targeted his political opponents in the 2003 and 2007 elections have since mutated into the Boko Haram we see today that terrorises through beheadings, butchering innocent villagers, bombing innocent people at shopping malls and in churches, raping and kidnapping.\nIt is true that Sheriff fell-out with Yusuf and the allegation stands that when the military captured Yusuf in late July 2009 and handed him over to the police in Borno State, he was allegedly executed on Sheriff’s instruction. Thus the root of the perception that Sheriff cannot be a sponsor but a hated enemy of Boko Haram. But the core of the old Yusufiya is no longer part of Boko Haram.\nBoko Haram is a mutation of political Boko Haram and Shekau’s Ansaru. The Yusufiya grew out of the Izala movement and had great respect for Izala. Boko Haram now beheads Izala followers. The “slaughterers” work with the political assassins and suicide bombers.\nThe sponsors of Boko Haram do not care how many innocent Nigerians are slaughtered, how many women are raped, how many girls and boys are kidnapped, how many villages are plundered. I have met too many victims to say, “It is not my problem”.\nWe are each diminished if we allow such crimes against our fellow citizens to persist. The Nigerian military is diminished if it uses Boko Haram tactics to address the problem. Evil will flourish and triumph if good men and women do nothing.\nMany Nigerian politicians have said little and done nothing to curb the slaughter of Nigerians that is being supported by the sponsors. While fathers die to protect their daughters and wives are raped and butchered the sponsors of Boko Haram are accorded privileges and protection.\nThey fly in private jets and are accorded military protection. Are the sponsors of Boko Haram so far above the law? Have the citizens of Nigeria lost the right to bring these men to justice? Who will stand up for the poor and oppressed who are being slaughtered and raped in their hundreds? By the grace of God we trust that good men and women will stand up and justice will prevail.\n*Davis, an Austrialian, is a negotiator\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"http://www.vanguardngr.com/2014/09/when-i-met-asari-and-agreed-a-peace-deal-stephen-davis/#sthash.tBTej3JR.dpuf","2":"2228","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.999994278"},{"0":"Don’t leave host community in ruins, Tinubu warns lithium investors\nPresident Bola Tinubu has advised lithium investors to prioritise environmental protection and community engagement, warning them not to leave the host community in ruins in their exploration activities.\nReceiving a delegation from Avatar New Energy Materials Company Limited and Canmax Technologies led by Nasarawa Governor Abdullahi Sule, Tinubu commended the inauguration of Nigeria’s largest lithium processing plant in Lafia, Nasarawa State.\nAccording to a statement by Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Ajuri Ngelale, Sule was accompanied on the visit to the President by Mr. Hi Yongwei, Chairman of Avatar New Energy Materials Company Limited, and Mr. Zhenhua Pei, Chairman, Canmax Technologies.\nTinubu, however, emphasised the need for responsible mining practices, saying, “You must not leave the community in ruins as you explore for our high-grade minerals. You must be concerned with cooperation and always care for the community.”\nThe President urged the companies to prioritize environmental protection, community engagement, and corporate social responsibility initiatives, ensuring that their operations benefit the local population and minimize ecological damage.\nAvatar New Energy Materials Company Limited has invested $500 million in the lithium processing plant, which produces about 4,000 metric tonnes daily. Canmax Technologies has announced a new investment of $200 million for another lithium processing plant in Nasarawa State.\nHe, however stated his administration’s commitment to ensuring that Nigeria becomes a key player in the global lithium market and a solar panel and EV battery manufacturing hub in Africa.\n”There are other aspects of lithium that you are exploring in the country, especially in battery production. Nigeria is a huge market for solar panels. Africa is a major consumer of solar technologies. I do not see why these panels and batteries cannot be produced here.\n“The labour is cheaper. Our youths are vibrant and skilled. Our people are brilliant and adapt to new technology. The economy is increasingly more vibrant, and Nigeria is dependable. We have the consumption capacity and a surplus of steady-handed citizens with gifted minds and an innate drive to work and produce.\n”We are caring partners. We want your investments to succeed so that you can expand further. Whenever you call on us, we will help you. You can, in mutually-beneficial collaboration with us, dominate the solar panel market as part of a revolution in Africa and the West African sub-region.\n”You can always promote the interest of China and Nigeria as the best place in Africa to do business. We are preparing to produce in this country the solar technologies that the entire continent will use,” the President said.\nTinubu also applauded Sule and Minister of Solid Minerals, Mr. Dele Alake, for their dedication to ensuring environmental protection and value addition by mining firms operating in the country.\n”The Governor of Nasarawa State and the Honourable Minister of Solid Minerals, Dele Alake, also share in these congratulations.\n”It is a great joy to have you (the Chinese executives) in Nigeria. It is part of our campaign that Nigeria is open for business. We congratulate your courage in believing in us and the inauguration of the new factory.\n”I can assure you that we will continue to give you the necessary support and encouragement.

Tolulope Akande-Sadipe is the chairperson of the House of Representatives Committee on Diaspora. The lawmaker, who represents Oluyole Federal Constituency, Oyo State, under the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC), in this interview with VICTOR OLUWASEGUN, speaks of her person, past experiences, philosophy, committee and other issues. Excerpts:\nAS the chairperson of the House Committee on Diaspora, what would you say has been your greatest challenge?\nDiaspora is key to the development of the nation, but we need to align the priorities of the three arms of government. For example, prior to the motion raised by me on the floor of the House on the need to investigate Diaspora remittances, the issue of Diaspora remittances was not given the priority it deserved.\nMy other example of a related challenge is human trafficking with human trafficking, a large number of girls are often trafficked abroad and there is a need for sincere and progressive collaboration between the relevant ministries and agencies – NAPTIP, NIDCOM, Nigerian Immigration Service and Ministry of Foreign Affairs. However, it is NAPTIP’s sole responsibility to deal with such cases as they have to work closely with immigration to prevent the trafficking at the source. Once these cases are reported, it is the duty of NIDCOM, NAPTIP and Foreign Affairs to bring our fellow citizens back home. The Nigerian police must also investigate, arrest the unscrupulous agents and the judiciary must prosecute on a timely basis.\nMy other key concern is the mode of preparing our country’s budget, who determines the infrastructure priority projects that go into the budget each year? What is the involvement of the local government and each constituency’s representative prior to the envelopes going out? In my opinion as an accountant, constituencies and states need to be carried along in determining the budgetary items for their localities. For example, in a private company, each department sends its requirements to the budgeting unit, which collates and builds a budget around each department’s requirements.\nYou are versed in policy formulation, business analysis, strategy development and implementation. Do you think this government is doing well in terms of Ease of Doing Business?\nThe policies are awesome; the programme is being driven very well by the Vice President’s office, but that is not enough. For the programme to truly succeed, all arms of government must cooperate. The legislators, once they pass value adding laws, need the executive to implement the laws and policies, while the judiciary needs to adjudicate fairly and timely. The onus falls on our civil service; their cooperation is key as each policy or law is a piece of paper; the civil service is utmost for the proper implementation of these laws and policies.\nYou are also an expert in tax/financial management, is the Finance Bill the right thing at this time when most Nigerians are hungry?\nThe Finance Bill, 2019 was presented together with the 2020 Appropriation Bill to the National Assembly by President Muhammadu Buhari and has been passed into law. The Bill, among other things, seeks to promote fiscal equity, align local laws with global best practices, introduce tax incentives for investments in infrastructure and the capital market. It also supports small- scale businesses in line with the ongoing Ease of Doing Business reforms and it has its pros and cons, good and bad. Small businesses with turnover less than N25 million to be fully exempted from Companies Income Tax (CIT) & entities with less than N25 million in turnover are exempted from VAT registration. Efficiency must also be built into the system such that VAT paid is completely remitted and in a timely basis to government coffers. We need focus on blocking loopholes that encourage diversion by creating barriers to diversion.\nHate Speech Bill, what do you think of it? Should it be passed in the House, especially as your constituency is against it?\nWhat does the term hate speech mean to you? Hate speech is an abusive or threatening speech or writing that expresses prejudice against a person or particular group. Why do you think we have so much hate speeches on social media platform? This is because Nigerians are disgruntled, Nigerians are unhappy. The platform creates an opportunity for Nigerians to voice out their opinions to be heard.\nWhile I condemn any form of abuse against the human race, I cannot say that the social media has not made positive impact; it has given an opportunity for positive news about the country to travel across the world. It is very informative and has aided prompt resolution on national issues raised. Persons are now more than ever being held accountable for crimes committed against humanity and the nation. As legislators, we understand that there are more pressing issues pertaining to the nation that need to be addressed, issues like unemployment, security, power, socio-economic development, infrastructural development Thus, priority in legislation should be to address these key issues and to create an enabling socio-economic environment for citizens of the country. This would resolve the prevalence of hate speeches, as citizens will be less likely to talk ill about the country when this occurs. Not that I am in support of hate speeches, some are malicious and untrue that have resulted in many lives, reputations and marriages etc. being ruined.\nHate speech itself is a tort under common law when it results in injury to whom it is targeted. Injury can be either emotional distress, physical or bodily harm or can even lead to death. All any such law does is to only codify it and put what already exists under common law into statutory form.\nThat being said, may I add that if need be, let us think of ways to regulate the social media rather than enacting draconian laws with strict penalties such as death is indicative of a dictatorial regime. Although if death should occur as a result of hate speeches, murder charges then may apply.\nHow useful are Diaspora remittances as a developmental tool for the country?\nLeveraging Diaspora Resources for National Development is aimed at creating an avenue for prospective, meaningful and sustainable diaspora investments, which if well realised will boost growth and development of our great country.\nWhat dictates your dressing?\nI am not a fashionista; I focus more on what suits my body type. I hardly follow trends not because I can’t afford it but because I find contributing to humanity more exciting. On a lighter note, I remember many friends calling me an ‘Ijebu’ as far back as my 30s as I wouldn’t spend money on frivolous things.\nKnowing what my income was at such a young age, they couldn’t understand why I wasn’t heavily into designer labels all the time nor could they understand why I wasn’t having shopping sprees on my trips abroad.\nHow do you unwind? What constitutes leisure to you?\nI love the quietness of nature; unwinding, for me, means spending quality time with my family and friends; a day at the beach;","1":"https://thenationonlineng.net/aspiring-female-politicians-shouldnt-marry-a-day-soup-men-house-panel-chair-akande-sadipe/","2":"1485","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999790192"},{"0":"President Buhari addressing the guests during the launch of the National Re-Orientation Campaign “Change Begins with Me” at the State House Conference Centre (SHCC) in Abuja.\n•Says Nigeria’s democracy is now endangered under a partisan cloud\nBy Emmanuel Aziken, Political Editor\nThe People’s Democratic Party, PDP has faulted President Muh-ammadu Buhari for quickly congratulating Mr. Godwin Obaseki on his declaration as winner of the Edo State governorship election, saying it is a reversal of his Inauguration Day declaration not to be beholden to anyone.\nThe PDP’s comment came in the face of strident condemnation by the state chapter of the PDP of the declaration of Mr. Obaseki as the winner of the election. The PDP’s candidate, Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu in a press conference in the hours leading to the declaration on Thursday had alleged subterfuge on the part of the Independent National Electoral Commission and the All Progressives Congress, APC saying that the results were cooked up ahead of the election. He also asserted that the results did not even reflect the huge turnout of the people on the premise that those who cooked the result did not envisage the huge turnout.\nEdo PDP in a statement also issued by its spokesman, Chris Enehikare noted several incidents of disruption of collation in places where PDP showed strong dominance, the open inducement of voters with money to vote and the willing collaboration of some electoral officers to allow what the party described as an electoral heist.\nThe assertions were denied by APC officials who challenged the PDP to prove its case in court.\nMeanwhile, the national spokesman of the PDP, Prince Dayo Adeyeye in a statement issued yester-day faulted President Buhari’s congratulation saying the president had not shown himself to be a father of all especially given that he had in the past not congratulated PDP candidates who won governorship elections.\nHe said: “President Buhari’s congratulatory message to Godwin Obaseki has finally revealed his hand in the Edo Guber Election imbroglio. We note with sadness that he had never extended similar congratulatory messages or goodwill to PDP candidates who were victorious in various Elections since he assumed office.\n“In Bayelsa State where his Party with the support of security agencies virtually declared war on Governor Seriake Dickson and the people of Bayelsa, the President refused to congratulate the PDP Candidate who against all odds managed to survive the APC onslaught. His aides claimed then that the President was not in the business of congratulating election winners.\nWhy the sudden change of heart now if we may ask? The only plausible explanation is that the President was eager to confer legitimacy on an otherwise badly flawed Election in which his Party acted like Shina Rambo, the notorious Armed Robber. Only that this time they were robbing the people of their votes.\n“The action of the President belies his statement that he belongs to nobody but belongs to everybody . The President has shown where he belongs. We recall that President Jonathan dutifully never failed to congratulate opposition candidates who won elections during his tenure including Adams Oshiomhole. That is what is expected of a statesman.\n“We did not lose the Gubernatorial Election in Edo State. We can therefore not be described as “bad losers” according to the APC State Chairman in Edo State, Anselm Ojezua. We were robbed by very shameless election riggers.\n“We fully support the Edo Chapter of the PDP in the total rejection of the election results. We also fully endorse their determination to employ all legitimate means to reclaim their stolen mandate.\nFinally we wish to warn Nigerians that our democracy is in grave danger.\nSince the advent of this administration, no election has been free and fair. We go for elections as if we are going to war; and virtually all elections conducted by INEC have been either inconclusive or blatantly rigged.\n“Today Rivers State has no representation in the National Assembly. No thanks to the powers that be. If we do not collectively rise to resist this anti people onslaught we might as well say bye bye to democracy.”\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"http://www.vanguardngr.com/2016/10/pdp-faults-buhari-obaseki/","2":"922","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.999917984"},{"0":"The Edo State Governor, Godwin Obaseki, has called on the Federal Government to help in funding the National Sports Festival, scheduled to hold in the state.\nObaseki said the state is ready to host the 20th edition of the sports event but does not have the financial capacity to host 11,500 athletes and officials.\nObaseki, who received members of the Main Organising Committee from the Federal Ministry of Youth and Sports Development in Benin City on Tuesday, said COVID-19 had taken its toll on the finances of the state.\nHe said: “Since March last year, you know the financial strength of most states, sub-nationals and countries. For us as a state, we are ready to host but don’t have the funds at this point in time to host the Games; this is the plain truth.\n“If the Federal Government however in its wisdom decides to bring the funding for the Games, we will be too willing to host the country. We have to live with COVID-19 because it has come to stay; even with the vaccination, the virus will still be around. Canceling the Games is not the solution to this issue. We have to sit down and look at all these issues critically before reaching a final decision.”\nObaseki added, “Beyond the Games itself, which is an instrument of unity and a way of engaging the youths, there is the Tokyo Olympics to prepare for. But how do we prepare for the Olympics without Edo 2020? Can we afford to expose our young people to the dangers of COVID-19 or would there be other Olympics in the future?

Nigerians have since independence complained because most public office holders lacked true leadership qualities.\nSo, I was genuinely pleasantly surprised when I encountered the Gombe State Governor, Ibrahim Hassan Dankwambo, Talban Gombe. This is because for once in a long while, I saw a public office holder who exemplified the real attributes that define what sound leadership is all about in contemporary Nigeria.\nFirst I discovered that in all his dealings, he has been able to distinguish himself by his academic, professional, public service and political careers. More remarkable is the fact that he had in the process, exceeded all expectations while shattering all known precedents and records set by his predecessors or peers, be it at the state, federal, regional or international level.\nHis distinguished career began from Coopers & Lybrand and continued at the Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN, from where he was appointed the Gombe State Accountant- General. And on account of his unrelenting hard work, perseverance, dedication and commitment to duty as well as displaying the highest level of professionalism which translated to notable achievements, he has received numerous awards, laurels and commendations. So, it was not surprising that he was soon after appointed the Accountant- General of the Federation before he answered the call of his people to contest the 2011 gubernatorial election which he won to the joy of his numerous supporters.\nParticularly worthy of note is the fact that Dankwambo’s commitment to excellence and exemplary performance is only matched by his honesty and sense of integrity. For instance, while most public office holders delight in looting the public till, Talban Gombe continued to demonstrate that he is not in that infamous category. And it is this trait which has endeared him to his peers, colleagues, underlings and political superiors alike.\nAs events continue to play out in the country, his watchword has remained strict neutrality and a rigid stance that did not favour many partisan interests. This adroit posture has earned him tremendous admiration and even grudging respect from all factions of the political class in Gombe State and beyond.\nHaving cut his teeth in turning around the Gombe State accounting system for the better, Dankwambo wasted precious little time in applying the same principles at the Office of the Accountant-General of the Federation as he had successfully formulated viable policies and financial strategies that the financial system of the country is today relying on.\nAfter this, his next port of call to serve humanity was nearer home, Gombe State, after he succumbed to his people’s pressure and agreed that it was time to change the prevailing status quo for the better. The Jewel of the Savannah was then in the grip of political godfathers, potentates and crown princes who regarded the state as their personal fiefdom and its resources to be squandered and apportioned as they and their acolytes and cronies thought fit.\nTherefore, armed with his awesome credentials as a highly reputed and tremendously regarded public servant, Talba, had within days of being sworn in as the Executive Governor, kick-started a series of working visits across the state to see for himself the hitherto shambled and dilapidated government structures and abused public service system encapsulated by shady dealings, financial mismanagement and marginalisation of the majority by those who felt they owned the government and considered same as their personal estate by doing and undoing things to favour them to the detriment of the masses.\nAfter properly diagnosing the state, Dankwambo had later come up with an 11-sector base committee of relevant professionals with terms of reference centred on formulating a working template and blueprint for the development of the state and rescuing the formerly abused public service. Consequently, following the submission of the various committees’ reports, Dankwambo swung into action and soon executed all the viable recommendations with preferential considerations to the education, health, agriculture, and infrastructural sectors of the state.\nToday, under the stewardship of the Talban Gombe, the state has turned out to be the most developed and transformed in the whole of the North-Eastern zone as evidenced by numerous state-of-the-art infrastructure made possible by workable administrative policies and strategies. Indeed, a visitor to the state cannot help but notice that thousands of kilometres of roads have been constructed all over the state, including model primary and secondary schools in all the 11 local government areas of the state.\nAt the same time, old ones are fully renovated and equipped with state-of-the-art facilities. There have also been notable interventions to upgrade hospitals and other health-related facilities; farmers have also benefited from government interventions as they have been provided with subsidised fertiliser, tractors and other farm implements.\nAt the same time, tens of thousands of women and youths have been trained in different skills acquisition programmes and also provided with start-up capital. Indeed, the giant International Conference Centre, Petroleum Tankers Parking Bay, Gombe Mega Motor Park are projects that can only be found in Gombe State despite the lean resources at the disposal of the administration.\nIn fact, it bears repeating that Dankwambo has transformed Gombe State into the industrial and agrarian hub of the North-East zone, a position that it enviably occupied in the past. In the process, he has changed the infrastructural, developmental, industrial and manufacturing landscape of the state for the better while drastically reducing its poverty, maternal and child mortality rates.\nIt is, therefore, not a surprise that many political activists, leaders of thought and influential pundits have called on Dankwambo to throw his hat in the ring by declaring his interest in the presidential contest so that Nigerians will have the opportunity of reaping the countless democratic dividends that he has been rendering to Gombe State and its people.\n*Mr. Yusuf, a political analyst, wrote from Damaturu,Gombe State.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"https://www.vanguardngr.com/2018/04/dankwambos-eyes-presidency/","2":"1309","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999752045"},{"0":"Yuan sale by CBN excites traders\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria sold yuan at a range of N49-51 at its first auction of the Chinese currency last week, traders said yesterday.\nThe auction, which is part of an attempt to encourage the use of an alternative trading currency, particularly given the high level of imports from China, sold the yuan for immediate value and for 15-day settlement, traders said.\nSome lenders got as much as 60 per cent of the volume they applied for, while one bank got just five per cent.

His armoured official car saved his life.\nVanguard further gathered that the activities of these moles may have been responsible for the recent shooting of the Nigerian Airforce Alpha Jet on September 12 which took off from Yola airport and was reported missing until Boko Haram terrorists said they shot it down and killed one of its pilot, which was confirmed by the Facebook account of friends of the military.\nSpeaking under condition of anonymity, a reliable source said Commanders on the field had for long wondered how information on strategies for deployment, type of weaponry and fall back tactics easily filtered out to the terrorists to the extent that soldiers’ movement, timing of deployment, and routes to take, became known to Boko Haram insurgents.\n“The situation became so bad that there was mutual suspicion among fellow commanders, the Brigade headquarters and even the Division headquarters. But at last, the moles were found out to be some of the orderlies and aides of Commanders. What they do is that after operational briefings and troops take off, these moles immediately pass on the information through calls.”\nAsked why it was difficult to discover the traitors before now, the source said, “Who will suspect that an orderly or the ADC of a Commander will be the one giving out information. He does everything for the Commander and he is with him all the time. He is the last person that would be suspected. But thank God, they have been exposed; the truth is now known”.\nAlready, the source noted that a Board of Inquiry (BOI) has been set up to carry out further investigations into the activities of the traitors and to try to find out if there were fellow fifth columnists still existing among the troops, after which a General Court Martial will be constituted to try the soldiers for Criminal Conspiracy among others.\nAlso, Vanguard was told at the weekend that six officers taking part in the offensive to flush out the terrorists from the Adamawa axis recently shot themselves in parts of their bodies that were not life threatening with a view to escape being drafted to the battle field to confront Boko Haram terrorists.\nAfter allegedly shooting themselves in the arm, hip, foot and making sure that the bullets did not affect any bones in these parts of their bodies, the officers ran to a military hospital and claimed that they were shot by terrorists.\nMedical experts attached to the hospital in Vintim, after carrying out several checks and x-rays on the gunshot wounds, discovered that the officers had ‘clean gunshot wounds’ which meant the injuries were 99% self inflicted.\nVanguard gathered that the Army High Command ordered that further medical tests be carried out to be doubly sure and that the x-rays were sent to Abuja where experts did further analysis and came out with the same results of ‘Clean Gunshot Wounds’ .\n“In one instance, an officer expertly shot at his arm from the front and the bullet came out from the back without touching any bone neither did it destroy any artery that would endanger the treatment of the hand. In another instance, an officer just opened fire on his foot but made sure no toe or dangerous part of the foot was affected,” a source said.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"http://www.vanguardngr.com/2014/10/military-arrests-soldiers-moles-boko-haram/#sthash.N1Pxqwmv.dpuf","2":"854","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.999956131"},{"0":"BY GBENGA OLARINOYE\nOSOGBO — OBAFEMI Awolowo University, OAU, Ile-Ife, has been rated the first and best university in Nigeria and 14th in Africa by the Webometric Ranking of world universities.\nIn the last rating, the university was ranked eighth in Nigeria and 79 in Africa.\nAccording to Webometric ranking released on February 6, 2013, OAU was rated above other universities in the country for its intellectual, academic, research and administrative supremacy.\nA release by the Public Relations Officer of the University, Mr. Abiodun Olarewaju, said this latest ranking reflected the success of the current University Administration under Professor Bamitale Omole.\nThe Vice-Chancellor, Professor Omole pledged to do all within his administrative power and academic experience to further reposition the institution to meet with the standard expected of a world class University within the context of 21st century intellectual market.\nMeantime, staff of the OAU have been advised to set a new road map to pursue research effort more vigorously with a view to continually impacting positively on the socio-economic, political and technological landscapes of the society.\nProfessor Omole gave the advice at a one-day retreat organized by the Staff Training and Development Unit of the Institution at Iloko-Ijesa, Osun State.\nIn the keynote address titled: “Moving This Leviathan: New Paradigm, New Strategies: 50 years of OAU and Beyond”, the Vice-Chancellor enjoined the participants not to dwell too much on the past achievements but strive to break new grounds in research and development.\nOmole reminded the participants not to forget the best practices, ethics and ethos as well as the institutional core values which made the university “past scientific achievements possible and which had made OAU a centre of Academic Excellence.”\nWhile expressing serious concern over administrative and academic malpractices which have bedeviled the Nigerian University system, the VC added that vices like admission racketeering, examination malpractices, misuse of research grants, misallocation and misappropriation of funds, sexual harassment, financial or material inducement before services are rendered should be discouraged and eradicated in the University.\nAccording to him: “As an Institution, we should, at all times, consider it an aberration to protect and defend our colleagues who are found in indecent behaviours and a variety of corrupt practices.

You very well recall that the leaders of our own party – whether ACN and all of that and the governors were missing from that conference.\n‘’To make matters worse, the confab was heavily criticised but the Goodluck Jonathan administration went on with it. This (the confab) was lopsided in terms of representation, ethnically, religiously, regionally; and they were insensitive to all of these things and then they want to force it down the throats of everyone. That is why it’s a problem.”\nPresident Buhari and his administration had called on aggrieved people in the country to take their grievances to the National Assembly which it said had the constitutional backing to address such concerns.\nBut there had been concerns that it would be impossible to get the National Assembly to make laws in line with the desires and wishes of Nigerians, especially as such laws may be detrimental to interests represented by the lawmakers.\nShehu is not bothered by such concerns. Reason: “The members of the National Assembly are not aliens and they don’t come from the moon. They are Nigerians and they are representing definite constituencies in some of the states. So, they are serving the purpose of representation. Why can’t they be trusted?”\nThe Presidential aide suggested that those behind the agitation in the country were those who had failed the nation in the past. “It is not like I have no respect for older people. But there are people who think that they have messed up this country so much that they now want to resolve the problems that they created and they are in a hurry to do that,” he said.\nHard knocks for Shehu\nShehu’s views attracted hard knocks from some delegates to the confab and leaders who insisted that the country must be restructured urgently to accelerate socio-economic growth and development.\nThose who picked holes in the Presidency’s stance were Leader of the National Christian Elders Forum, NCEF, Chief Solomon Asemota; Elder statesman and Afenifere chieftain, Chief Ayo Adebanjo; Elder statesman, Chief E.K. Clark; Ogoni activist, Mr. Ledum MitEe, Mr Yinka Odumakin; and former President of Trade Unions Congress, TUC, Mr. Peter Esele.\nHowever, Second Republic lawmaker, Dr Junaid Mohammed, said the 2014 confab was doomed from the beginning and some of the recommendations were smuggled in.\nNo joining issues on this– Asemota\nChief Solomon Asemota, SAN, a member of Presidential Advisory Committee on the 2014 National Conference, said there was no going back on restructuring of the country to ensure justice and equity, adding that the NCEF would not join issues with Malam Garba Shehu on the 2014 Confab recommendations.\nHis words: ‘’The NCEF has a collective view. We are talking about restructuring that encompasses everything. We are not going into any debate with Garba Shehu on the implementation of the confab report.\n‘’We have been operating a faulty constitution and those who have gained so much from it will not like to let go.’’\nPresidency can’t pull wool over our eyes – Ayo Adebanjo\nA delegate to the conference, Chief Ayo Adebanjo, took a swipe at the Presidency, saying it would not pull wool over peoples’ eyes on its objection to the 2014 National Conference report.\nAdebanjo said: “Does he want to organise his own which will be all-inclusive? We have passed the stage where a person can pull wool over our eyes. Is that the reason he is jettisoning the report? What is their objection in the recommendations of the confab? I have told him (President Buhari) that he should stop this talk of throwing away the Confab report. Who are the people that forced the current constitution we are operating now? This is the question. He should stop drawing wool over our eyes.\n‘’You can never get the composition in the county that produced the recommendations of the 2014 National Conference. We had quality people there, we had judges there, workers and lawyers; it was all inclusive.\n‘’What is the non- inclusiveness he is talking about? It is just pretence because we passed 600 resolutions unanimously. How many people drafted the constitution that was forced on us? Is it not the military?\n‘’They gathered about 50 people to draft the 1999 constitution and they put aside the one the founding fathers gave us in 1960, agreed to by Chief Obafemi Awolowo, Sir Ahmadu Bello and Dr Nnamdi Azikiwe.\n‘’The Presidency has not been able to talk about that. If you say the confab is not all inclusive, what is the problem of going back to the 1960 constitution? What do they have against that?”\nFG must restructure Nigeria – Odumakin\nAnother delegate to the conference, Mr Yinka Odumakin, said though the President could dump the outcome of the confab in the archives if he had issues with the report but he must be committed to restructuring the country.\n“We are not fixated on the 2014 National Conference as an event but the federal spirit that the outcomes engendered. If the President has issues with the conference, he can leave it in the archives but he must start to steer the country in the direction of true federalism promised in the APC manifesto. We acknowledge his acceptance that agitations for restructuring are legitimate. He must walk the talk.”\nGarba Shehu should define inclusiveness\nAlso speaking, a former President of Trade Unions Congress, TUC, who was at the conference, Comrade Peter Esele, said: ‘’It is important for Garba Shehu to define what he meant because every section of this country was represented.\n‘’We had Igbo, Hausa and Yoruba. All the political parties in the country were also represented except the APC that declined to attend. We even had representatives of the military at the conference. He needs to define inclusiveness.\n“We are not saying that the Confab report is the panacea to all our problems. But there are certain things this government can take from the report. It does not matter whether it was convened by PDP or another party. What matters is that Nigeria’s money was used to organize the conference in the interest of this country.”\nConfab doomed from inception – Junaid Mohammed\nSecond Republic lawmaker, Dr Junaid Mohammed, who was also a delegate at the conference, said the 2014 Confab was doomed from the beginning.\nHe said: “Garba Shehu is too insignificant for me to start arguing with but I can confirm that the outcome of the Confab was also rigged because some of the recommendations made after the Confab were not agreed on.\n“Issues like that of State Police and many others were never agreed on at the Confab yet it is contained in the recommendation. I believe it is within the rights of President Buhari’s government to refuse to implement the outcome of the 2014 Confab.”\nHe said he was not surprised by the stance of the Presidency because “from day one, the All Progressives Congress, APC, dissociated itself and they never sent anyone to the conference. APC also maintained that if they win the elections, they will not implement the report of the Confab. So I am not surprised at their unwillingness to implement the report.”\nIt’s proper to look at the report — Calrk\nChief Edwin Clark on his part said: “I am pleading with him (Buhari) to have an open heart. If the party can look at restructuring, it is only proper for the administration to look at the report of the conference because a lot of money was put into the project and everybody was involved. We made over 600 recommendations and we had 20 committees which had the northern delegates chairing more committees than the southern delegates.”\nIt’s a sad day — Anenih\nAlso speaking with Vanguard, former Minister of Women Affairs and a delegate to the conference, Iyom Josephine Anenih, said if government fails to implement the report of the all encompassing conference, the progress of the country will be set backward.\nAnenih said: “It is a sad day, the day the Presidency will make such a statement that it will not look at the report of the 2014 Conference. We do not know which other conference can be as inclusive as that of the 2014 Confab.”\nIt’s unfortunate — Bishop Bogobiri\nOn his part, the Bishop of Catholic Diocese of Kafanchan and a delegate to the conference, Bishop Joseph Bogobiri, condemned moves by the Presidency to jettison the report of the conference.\nAccording to him, 2014 conference report contains all the wishes and aspirations of Nigerians, adding that if the present agitations in some parts of the country must be nipped in the bud or curtailed, it has become very imperative for the government to implement recommendations of the conference.\nHis words: “It is unfortunate that we have a government that is doing things its own way; the government should put in place things that will reduce tension and discontent in the land. It is really unfortunate. If the statement had come from the government, it is really unfortunate that the government is listening to a few people.”\nGovt should look at the report —Ledum Mitee\nFormer President, Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People, MOSOP and a delegate to the conference, Ledum Mitee said to throw away the entire report because of the excuse that the composition was not all inclusive was not healthy for the country.\nHe said: “It is more important to look at the content of what came out of the conference and not the number. To throw away everything because of that flimsy excuse is not healthy.”\nIt’s unfortunate, says Salami\nFormer National Chairman of Labour Party and delegate to the 2014 National Conference, Alhaji Abdulkadir Salami on his part, described as unfortunate, the rejection of the report.\n“It is unfortunate for them to say they will not implement the report of the 2014 National Conference because of it not being all inclusive in participation.\n‘Let him set up another one that he thinks is all inclusive.”\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"https://www.vanguardngr.com/2017/10/why-fg-wont-use-2014-confab-report-presidency/2014","2":"2407","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999656677"},{"0":"The embattled Acting Chairman of Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, Ibrahim Magu, was on Wednesday confronted with more allegations.\nThe Justice Ayo Salami-led Presidential panel asked him to account for 380 houses and seven vessels loaded with crude oil.\nThe probe panel also grilled on him on the disposal of assets worth N37 billion.\nMagu is being grilled, following allegations raised against him by Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami(SAN).\nThe panel started quizzing Magu on Monday after his arrest by detectives in Abuja.

They should be bold enough to say that they do not want to be part of Nigeria any longer and stop talking about what does not make sense anymore in the country.\nNo longer ideal — Kaita\n“Regional autonomy and parliamentary system of government can no longer serve a complex society like Nigeria and our founding fathers were wise enough to jettison the system and adopt the present Presidential system, which to all intent and purposes, remains the best for a country like ours,” he noted.\nAccording to the founding member of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, neither the granting of autonomy to any region in the country nor a return to parliamentary system of government would solve the socio-political problems of the nation.\nKaita said that all that was needed to make the presidential system more useful was to strengthen the institutions of government to serve the citizens better and reposition the country as a strong, united nation in the world.\nAdding his voice to the debate, National Secretary of the Congress for Progressive Change, CPC, Buba Galadima, described any call for regional autonomy as an invitation to the dissolution of the country.\n“If they make the mistake to allow the kind of regional autonomy requested by the Yoruba, it is a recipe for the country’s disintegration because of the kind of politics being played in Nigeria. Our political immaturity would lead to dismembering the country as soon as any region is granted autonomy,” the politician noted.\nGaladima warned that the country could disintegrate if urgent steps were not taken to address the growing sense of injustice and marginalisation of sections of the country by the government.\nHe maintained that demands for autonomy and other issues were borne out of perceived injustice and inability of the administration to provide the basic needs of the people.\nIt’s retrogressive — Haliru Mohammed\nIn his submission, immediate past Minister of Defence, Dr. Bello Haliru Mohammed described calls for a return to regional structure as retrogressive.\nAccording to him, states replaced the regions because of demands by ethnic nationalities for self-determination, adding that a u-turn to the old structure would be a repeat of the scenario where major ethnic groups like Hausa, Yoruba and Igbo were in total control of the regions and marginalised other groups.\nThe former Acting National Chairman of the PDP said rather than advocate regionalism what was required of the country now was to sit down and work out the modus operandi of our federation to accommodate all the ethnic diversities without any section feeling dominated.\nHis words: “Going back to regional structure is going to be retrogressive because states were created because of the demand by ethnic nationalities for self determination. To go back to regional structure where the major ethnic groups like Hausa, Yoruba, Igbo were in complete control of the regions is dangerous.\n“General Yakubu Gowon responded to the demands of the minority groups and created states to allow for some level of self-determination for ethnic nationalities. Going back will make major ethnic groups to continue to dominate the minorities. Now, there is some level of equality between the nationalities regardless of the number and size.\n“What Nigeria needs now is to sit down and work out our modus operandi of a federation that would accommodate all our ethnic diversities without one section feeling a sense of domination by others. Federating units should be different ethnic nationalities as we have in states. If there is need for creation of more states like in the case of South-East and also to break some of the larger and more populated states in the North and South, that can be accommodated rather than going back to regions.”\nHowever, a former Senator from Kano State, Usman Kabiru Umar, stated that he would support any political restructuring that would bring about a strong, united and progressive Nigeria, where every citizen would have a sense of belonging. “Now, if they say that autonomy and return to parliamentarism would guarantee the promotion of peace, development and a united Nigeria, so be it,”\nIndeed, Eya, who spoke in his personal capacity as a public commentator, said the South-West clamour for six regions was sound.\n“Before the Presidential system was introduced, we had four regions. The North accepted the regions and we had Parliamentary system. The presidential system is very expensive; if we continue with it, we will soon go bankrupt. The parliamentary system worked for us. Then, if you did not win an election you cannot become a minister. Now the president appoints ministers from everywhere and they are not accountable to the people.\nNoting that Ohanaeze had prepared a document on the constitution amendment, he said: “We agree with the South-West on six regions, which should become the federating units. The Federal Government should have nothing to do with state or local government creation.\n“There is constant demands for new states and local governments because the military made them avenues for getting more allocation from the centre. Local governments should be states’ creation; they are not federating units. We stand for equity, fair-play and justice. The military gave North undue advantage and they do not want to relinquish it,” he said.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"http://www.vanguardngr.com/2012/09/north-tackles-yoruba-leaders-on-autonomy/","2":"1509","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9998283386"},{"0":"Kogi 2019: Wada rejects outcome\nBy James Azania, Lokoja\nEven before final announcement of the results of Saturday’s governership election in Kogi State, the candidate of the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Musa Wada has rejected the likely outcome.\nAddressing a press conference, in Lokoja on Sunday, which coincided with the collation of results from the 21 LGAs of the state at the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) office in capital, Wada alleged that the results were all false.\nHe said that what happened in the state over the weekend was neither democracy nor a reflection of the wishes of the electorate.\nHe said that the wishes of the people did not prevail at the polls.\nHe lamented that the police colluded with INEC to undermine the will of the people of the state.\nHe said there is no need allowing for election, “if Okene that had forty thousand accredited voters, now came up with a hundred and twelve thousand.”\nHe described it as a sad day for Kogi people, who he said are in mourning mood.\nRead Also: BREAKING: APC’s Yahaya Bello leads in Kogi\n“Do you see anybody rejoicing?

He wants to be recognised as the one directing the affairs of the nation at every stage: from the time he was military Head of State, civilian President, through (the late President Umaru Musa) Yar’Adua’s time to (former President Goodluck) Jonathan’s period. He has the feeling that he knows it all.\n“I cannot recognise any invitation from Obasanjo. He described Abiola as not the messiah we were looking up to. Is Obasanjo the messiah now? I think he should retire. I know Obasanjo well. He cannot enjoy my support.”\nThe former Federal legislator advised Yoruba to be steadfast and support President Buhari in next year’s poll.\nUrging the Afenifere leader, Chief Rueben Fasoranti and Ayo Adebanjo to ignore Obasanjo’s antics, Fsanmi said the former President was trying to sow new seeds of discord in the group.\nHe added: “Fasoranti and Adebanjo are my good friends. We were in the Jos convention of the Action Group (AG) together. We were followers of the late Chief Obafemi Awolowo. Obasanjo is not sincere. We should not allow Obasanjo’s politics to divide us.\n“We should be careful about Obasanjo. I have my reservations about him. Yoruba must come together, but not behind Obasanjo; Obasanjo can’t lead us. He was a minister, military Head of State and civilian President. The honour that was conferred on Abiola by President Buhari should have been done by Obasanjo. He did not do it.\n“We thank President Buhari for doing this. We should support him and not Obasanjo’s agenda. Obasanjo should go into retirement. He only wants to be seen and heard.”\nFasanmi also lauded the All Progressives Congress (APC) for the success of its national convention.\nHe said: “Contrary to expectations that things would fall apart at the convention because of the rancour that attended the earlier congresses at the ward, local government and state levels. There was also the issue of the complaints by the New Peoples Democratic Party (nPDP) members that had dominated the media for some time.\n“So, all eyes were on the party last Saturday as it went into the convention. But the leaders were able to manage these issues maturely and the convention ended well. This is highly commendable.\n“President Buhari, APC governors, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu and some other leaders of the party particularly deserve commendation for displaying sagacity in successfully managing those tough issues. It is hoped that the party will build on this feat as it faces the 2019 elections.”\nSenator Fasanmi also congratulated Adams Oshiomhole, saying: “The ‘no losers’ attitude of the chairman (Oshiomhole) is the way to go.”","1":"http://thenationonlineng.net/fasanmi-to-afenifere-ignore-obasanjo/","2":"1031","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9996729493"},{"0":"Desmond Eliot…makes a u-turn\nBy Ben Njoku\nAs the protest over fuel subsidy removal rages, many Nigerian entertainers who initially supported Goodluck Jonathan during his presidential campaign last year have eventually dumped him to his fate.\nTop on the list of these entertainers is actor Desmond Elliot. He was one of the many Nollywood stars that endorsed Goodluck Jonathan months before the April 2011 polls.\nSurprisingly, the same actor on Wednesday, made a U-turn on his support for the president, while speaking at the mass protest against the fuel subsidy removal, in Ojota, Lagos.\nThe baby-face actor said the action is not only meant to inflict untold hardship on the innocent masses but also, it is a harsh decision on the part of the government.\nHe took to his Twitter account to express his disappointment in the incumbent administration. He tweeted:\n‘We have lost everything we met on the land. Cocoa, palm oil, groundnuts, cotton, cashew and rubber have been forgotten and are better produced by nations who came to learn from us. We have lost our moral compass, our society is fractured, our statehood is threatened.\n“Our citizens are in all prisons around the world. Some of them prefer foreign prisons to coming back to Nigeria. Our passport is treated with disdain everywhere you present it. Why should our government be this big with special advisers on cassava and beans affairs.\nDo we need 36 ministers? Why would our president spend close to a billion on food while close to eighty percent live on less than a dollar a day? Why should he budget a billion for generators and diesel when he is urging us to believe in his power sector reform? Why should we believe the government when it says the subsidy gain will be properly reinvested. Bad leadership and coruption must stop.\nAlso Dickson Iroegbu who campaigned for Jonathan has equally dumped him. A notable film maker cum writer, Iroegbu last year relocated to Abuja, all in the bid to campaign for GEJ. “Goodluck for Nigeria” and “It’s Possible” was his slogans then.\nLending support to the President last year, Iroegbu said “like many actors, we have seen Jonathan improve by the day. I personally trust him. I can fight for him to shine like a star. He said he will ensure that no Nigerian goes to bed hungry, it is not about crying, he has started taking actions already.\nMr. President is in dire need of all of us to drive away the hawks in power, and as our leader, he has shown the right direction so far. A little benefit of doubt can solve the “Ifs” theory in film making. If he continues this way, then soon, very soon we shall be united.”\nIronically, speaking against the fuel subsidy removal, the notable film maker accused President Jonathan of being insensitive to the plight of the poor masses.\nHis words “I have said it before, it is an insensitive action. It is anti-masses. Personally, I don’t care what government thinks they are doing in the name of palliatives. First and foremost, government should go back to status quo. I feel aggrieved. I feel sad. This deceit must stop.”\nThis government is losing credibility too fast. The price of goods, transportation, medical, and everything else has skyrocketed. People who traveled to various places can’t return to base, we can go on and on. It is quite disheartening.\nI am also suffering it. People have called me names I don’t deserve, just for supporting President Goodluck Jonathan.”\nOn his own, Segun Arinze urged the president to listen to the voice of the masses and do well to revert the fuel price. He faulted the government for not building trust in the Nigerian citizens before implementing such policy.\nArinze whose faction of the Actors Guild of Nigeria(AGN) recently organised a “Nollywood Roundtable on Deregulation” at Eko Hotel and Suites to drum support for the federal government on the removal of the controversial fuel subsidy was speaking at a television show monitored by HVP.\nOther Nollywood stars who should bury their faces in shame included Francis Duru who co-ordinated Naija Artistes for Goodluck project with an umbrella body called Goodluck Campaign last year alongside Richard Ossai, veteran actor Olu Jacobs, Monalisa Chinda Ramsey Nuoah Susan Peters, Genevieve Nnaji, Ufuoma Ejenobor, Ngozi Nwosu, Nonso Diobi, Clem Ohameze and Femi Brainard.\nOthers are; Linc and Yul Edochie, Yemi Blaq, Mercy Aigbe, Ejike Asiegbu, Uche Iwuji, Chinyere Winifred, Uche Obodo, Emmanuella Njudigbo, Maureen Solomon, Tony Umez, Emeka Enyiocha, Benita Nzeribe and several top Northern based actors who trooped into the audio visual of the MSquad crew to shoot a video for a song, which was produced by Asuquo. Today, these entertainers are singing a different song.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"http://www.vanguardngr.com/2012/01/nollywood-stars-who-dumped-gej/","2":"1129","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9998912811"},{"0":"MY father was kidnapped in Nigeria on a Saturday morning in early May. My brother called to tell me, and suddenly there was not enough breathable air in the world. My father is 83 years old. A small, calm, contented man, with a quietly mischievous humor and a luminous faith in God, his beautiful dark skin unlined, his hair in sparse silvery tufts, his life shaped by that stoic, dignified responsibility of being an Igbo first son.\nHe got his doctoral degree at Berkeley in the 1960s, on a scholarship from the United States Agency for International Development; became Nigeria’s first professor of statistics; raised six children and many relatives; and taught at the University of Nigeria for 50 years. Now he makes fun of himself, at how slowly he climbs the stairs, how he forgets his cellphone. He talks often of his childhood, endearing and rambling stories, his words tender with wisdom.\nSometimes I record his Igbo proverbs, his turns of phrase. A disciplined diabetic, he takes daily walks and is to be found, after each meal, meticulously recording his carbohydrate grams in a notebook. He spends hours bent over Sudoku. He swallows a handful of pills everyday. His is a generation at dusk.\nOn the morning he was kidnapped, he had a bag of okpa, apples and bottled water that my mother had packed for him. He was in the back seat of his car, his driver at the wheel, on a lonely stretch between Nsukka, the university town where he lives, and Abba, our ancestral hometown. He was going to attend a traditional meeting of men from his age group. A two-hour drive. My mother was planning their late lunch upon his return: pounded yam and a fresh soup. They always called each other when either traveled alone. This time, he didn’t call. She called him and his phone was switched off. They never switched off their phones. Hour after hour, she called and it remained off. Later, her phone rang, and although it was my father’s number calling, a stranger said, “We have your husband.”\nKidnappings are not uncommon in southeastern Nigeria and, unlike similar incidents in the Niger Delta, where foreigners are targeted, here it is wealthy or prominent local residents. Still, the number of abductions has declined in the past few years, which perhaps is why my reaction, in the aftermath of my shock, was surprise.\nMy close-knit family banded together more tightly and held vigil by our phones. The kidnappers said they would call back, but they did not. We waited. The desire to urge time forward numbed and ate my soul. My mother took her phone with her everywhere, and she heard it ringing when it wasn’t. The waiting was unbearable. I imagined my father in a diabetic coma. I imagined his octogenarian heart collapsing.","1":"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/31/opinion/sunday/chimamanda-ngozi-adichie-my-fathers-kidnapping.html?_r=1","2":"607","3":"Politics","4":"2","5":"en","6":"0.9999523163"},{"0":"Order of elections: Bribe claims rock National Assembly\nLawmakers may have dumped their agreement with party chiefs to pull the brakes on their plan to override the President’s veto of the Electoral Amendment Bill reversing the order of elections, The Nation learnt yesterday.\nUnless the National Caucus meeting of the All Progressives Congress (APC) slated for today at the Aso Villa and the National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting billed for tomorrow can convince Senator Bukola Saraki and Speaker Yakubu Dogara to get their colleagues to back off; the Senate and the House of Representatives are likely to proceed with the plan, a source said.\nSupporters of the bill have alleged that “some powerful individuals sympathetic to the President” at the weekend perfected a plan to bribe National Assembly members.\nThe allegation is that pro- executive senators might receive $50,000 each. House of Representatives members sympathetic to the President will each receive $30,000 to “kill the amendment”, which was initiated by the lawmakers.\nThis could however not be independently confirmed. Pro- Buhari senators described the allegation as “hogwash”, saying if there was any such move, those pushing that the National Assembly should override the veto were plotting to induce “ those in their camp financially.”\n“They are diverting attention from their plan, “a pro- Buhari senator said at the weekend.\nLawmakers in support of the bill said the plot to bribe National Assembly members was perfected at “some high profile meetings “in Abuja at the weekend. The meeting was also said to have resolved that “anti-executive lawmakers who have cases with anti-corruption agencies should be threatened with prosecution in days to come”.\nThose said to have attended were some pro-Buhari governors from the Northwest , the Northcentral and the Northeast. A “minister from Southsouth” was also said to be present.\nThey said they learnt that “some key members of the executive who have been spearheading strategies for President Buhari’s re-election in 2019 were unequivocal that the National Assembly must be stopped from going ahead with plans to veto the President on the electoral bill as amended by us, particularly the order of the 2019 national elections. “\nIn withholding assent to the bill, the President argued that the amendment by the lawmakers infringed on the constitutional powers of INEC.\nThe President also said that the passage of the bill could lead to a situation where the National Assembly would be seen as legislating for the states on local government management.\nThe Legal Department of the National Assembly, however, faulted the points raised by President Buhari to withhold assent to the bill.\nIt advised the lawmakers to go ahead with overriding the veto if they so wished.\nThe President’s action has further polarised both chambers of the assembly, with those in his support claiming that 54 out of the 109 senators have indicated their intention to vote against overriding the veto.\nAn anti – Buhari senator rejected the claim that 54 senators might vote against overriding the veto. “But for the death of Senator Ali Wakili (Bauchi South) the Senate would have voted on the veto last Thursday. And all this would have been laid to rest, “ he said.\nA source at the weekend insisted that the plan to override President Buhari’s veto was “still very much on”.\nThe National Assembly has continued with mobilising for signatures in support of a possible override of the President’s veto.\nThe source claimed that 67 senators had signed “a pro-Senate register to override the President’s veto.\nThe number, said to have been in a register kept by a Northeast senator, the source claimed, swelled to 67 from last week’s 63.\nAccording to the source, “the number of senators might rise far beyond 80 if the more than 20 others said to be sitting on the fence sign up this week”.\nIt was also learnt that pro-Buhari senators are unrelenting in their push to stall the plot to override the President.\nThe source said: “The Pro-Saraki group has encouraged some of its members to infiltrate the rank of the Pro-Buhari group to give them a false sense of hope that they are greater in number. That makes the pro-Buhari group have a false sense of improvement but the senators know where they really belong.\n”A meeting of the pro- Senate group held in Lagos after the wedding party of the daughter of Africa’s richest man, Aliko Dangote, at the weekend. The meeting afforded the Pro-Senate Senators the opportunity to review the register and it was affirmed that 67 senators have so far signed,” the source said.\nHe noted that about 20 senators believed to be sitting on the fence who had been neutral in the meetings of the Pro-Senate and Pro-Buhari so far are set to sign the register.\nIt was learnt that three Senior Advocates of Nigeria (SANs) joined the Senators at the Lagos meeting.\nThe Lagos meeting, it was gathered, adopted the interpretation of the law that the two-thirds majority required to override the President’s veto are “those present in each chamber and not two-thirds majority of all members of the Senate or the House”.\nThe source noted that baring last-minute changes, “the plan to over ride veto may start this week because the Senate leadership is sure of sufficient number to act and get the desired results”.\nSenate Committee on Police Affairs, Senator Abu Ibrahim insisted that the Electoral Act amendment 2018 is Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) agenda aimed at frustrating the APC during the 2019 election.\nThe Katsina South lawmaker, who spoke in Abuja, insisted that those plotting to override the President’s assent on the Bill will fail.\nTo him, it is practically impossible for those plotting to override the assent of the President to secure two-third majority on the floor of the upper chamber.\nIbrahim described the adoption of the conference report which placed presidential election last in reordered sequence of elections as an afterthought that will be defeated on the floor of the Senate.\nHe said: “I am sure there is no way we can override the President on the floor of the Senate. They cannot get the two-third required to override Mr. President. I am against the Bill. You cannot just come now and say you want to change the election sequence. I will not for vote for it. I will stand up to oppose it even if it is only me alone. I will oppose it. I am from Katsina State. Whatever happens, I will oppose it.”\n“Even if the National Assembly has the power to reorder election sequence, it remained an afterthought coming when it did.\n“The PDP has no president, APC has. From the totality of the Bill, this Bill is working for the PDP, not APC. The Bill is PDP agenda.”\nOn the legal advice which dismissed the premise upon which President Buhari withheld assent to the Bill, Ibrahim noted that whatever the legal advice might be, it will still come to the floor of the Senate for consideration.\nIbrahim asked Nigerians not to worry about the Bill since “it will die a natural death”.\nNigerians, he said, should rather worry about the inability of the National Assembly to pass the 2018 budget months after it was presented.\nHe also said that Nigerians should be worried about the inability of the Senate to confirm many nominees forwarded to it for consideration and approval.\nOn the insinuation that the leadership of the National Assembly is divided on the Bill, Ibrahim said that might not be far from the truth since the leadership has not spoken openly about the Bill.\nHe said: “As an experienced senator, I can see there is a problem somewhere, which we have to address. Part of it is what the President did the other day by meeting the leadership of the two chambers to find a meeting point.”\nIbrahim insisted that Senate President Bukola Saraki and House of Representatives Speaker Yakubu Dogara must, at all times, be mindful of what their members wanted “because we are the people who put them in office”.\nThe lawmaker who described the National Assembly as the melting pot of different realities noted “everything we do, there will be differences because individual, ethnic, religious and political affiliations”.\nThe differences, he said, remained the live wire of the National Assembly, which should not surprise anybody.","1":"http://thenationonlineng.net/order-elections-bribe-claims-rock-national-assembly/","2":"1819","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999198914"},{"0":"By Johnbosco Agbakwuru\nGOVERNOR Dave Umahi of Ebonyi state, Monday prayed that God should give Nigeria a president “who has good heart like President Muhammadu Buhari for the good of this country.”\nThe governor also said that the people of South East are grateful to President Buhari for what he described as mega projects the President was doing in the zone.\nGovernor Umahi, who spoke to State House correspondents after meeting with President Buhari at the Presidential Villa, Abuja, condemned the sit-at-home order declared by the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, describing it as the worst thing to happen to the economy of the area.\nHe said those observing the IPOB’s sit-at-home order even when the separatist group had cancelled the order were doing so out of fear.\nHe advised those holding federal positions from the zone to always visit their states and identify with their people so in order to help to determine whether the people are marginalized as claimed in some quarters.\nThe governor commended President Buhari on some landmark projects in South East especially the Second Niger Bridge which he said was becoming a reality, the award of the eastern corridor of the railway line which he said would fast track commercial activities in the area.\nOn why he was at the State House, he said, “I came to see, Mr. President. One is to thank him very highly for a number of mega projects that he is doing in the southeast. The second Niger bridge is fast and fast becoming a reality. Each time we visit that bridge location it is always like a dream.\n“So we the people of South East are very grateful to Mr. President for this. We also thank him for the award of this Eastern corridor of the railway line. This is a project that is going to fast track the commercial activities of our people.\n“I recall that when I was in school, I used to join train from my state, Ebonyi, and then get up to Maiduguri where my brothers were staying for my holidays.\n“Mr. President is about restoring that hope. We are deeply very grateful. But I also reminded Mr. President that one of his cardinal objectives is to integrate in South East or the state capitals, but in putting together the project through South East that the capital of Ebonyi state, which is Abakaliki, and capital of Anambra state, which is Awka, were omitted.\n“And I reminded, Mr. President that the South East governors had requested that I write which I did, but not yet approved by the Honourable Minister of Transport, which Mr. President said he will find out why they were omitted in the first place.\n“I am very, very hopeful that Mr. President is going to give approval to those two locations. And also the limestone grants to fast track the fertiliser presidential initiative, which has helped the country Nigeria so much in food sufficiency.\n“Let me point out that without the effort of Mr. President, through this fertiliser initiative and other programmes in agricultural sector, it would have been a very difficult time for this country. And so that project is supposed to produce a large set of granules to enable us produce fertilisers to serve the South-South, South East, and part of North Central.\n“Mr. President has already approved the funds and released to Solid Mineral Development Fund. But part of the requirement is that there must be SPV integration or private sector initiative. They have applied to Mr. President for approval through the Chief of Staff. So we had to remind Mr. President.\n“Lastly, four years back, Mr. President was in Ebonyi state about November to commission a number of projects and lay foundation stone to others. I reminded Mr. President that we are expecting him four years later, which would be November for him to come to Ebonyi State. The last time he spent one night but this time we are asking him to spend three nights.\n“We have over 20 different projects that we consider good enough for Mr. president to commission. We have completed the Muhammadu Buhari light tunnel bridge complex, the first of its kind in Africa. for Mr. President to commission.\n“We have gotten to the stage of completing the best medical center, King David University of Medical Sciences, the best in Africa. We have completed the largest mall, the most beautiful mall you can see anywhere in West Africa.\n“We have completed additional six twin flyover bridges, well decorated and beautiful. We want Mr. President to commission it. We want Mr. President to commission the St. Margeret international market, the largest market in West Africa.\n“We have over 200 kilometre concrete roads in Ebonyi state, some of them federal roads, some concrete roads. We have over 1000 kilometre road completed, since my first tenure. Of course, the list can be unexhaustive here. Even the three agric Industrial clusters are ready for Mr. President to commission.\n“We also have a number of ongoing projects. Most of them will terminate at the end of the 2021. Like the International Airport, which Mr. President two years ago gave approval. Now we are the first in the whole Nigeria to build a an international airport runway with concrete that is going to be ready for Mr. President to lay the foundation stone. I will invite him next year to commission it.\n“We have the first flight about May 29 2022. We also have a number of road projects, especially the 199 kilometre of Abakaliki ring road, of which the state government has completed with 53 kilometre of it.\n“And of course, the limestone granules is Mr. President project and he has to lay the foundation stone.\n“But I think after Lagos and Abuja, Ebonyi remains, another state with the highest numbers of flyover and Ebonyi Airport remains the largest after Lagos and Abuja.\n“So this is why we came and I’m happy that Mr. President, is quite disposed towards visiting us again.”\nAsked the South East leaders were working together to make sure that the two major political parties have one candidate from the zone for presidency in 2023, he said, “Well, for me, I’m very much entrenched in completing my projects. And I will look into politics when my tenure is remaining one year, which is from May 29 2022. And I think it is the same thing with other governors of South East and by extension, governors of APC.\n“My position about what you ask is that our people that are in those political parties are making the efforts in selling the need for south East to produce the next president. But I think both the governors and Mr. President should not be distracted, when the elections are done and won, it should be governance.\n“But in this country, the moment the election is completed, the next one starts. It is the masses that are being cheated. So those whose job are politics and who are not into elected position, or appointed position have all the time and the opportunity to do this conversing.\n“But I continue to say that power rest in the hands of God. And God, will also give us the next president who has good heart like President Buhari for the good of this country.\n“We need God’s own anointing for our own anointed President for the interest and unity of this country.”\nFielding question on the position of the regional security network, Ebubeagu, he said,\n“Talking from Ebubeagu position, it’s quite formidable and doing a great job in synergy with all the security agencies. And if you read through the newspapers, you see a lot of exploits that are being done in the South East. It is quite tasking, security wise, and we are tackling it.”\nOn the promise to address the grievances of the youths over the alleged marginalization the Federal Government, he said, “In terms of the issue of youth protest and my asking as the Chairman of South East Governos to give the leaders six months, well, we are on that matter. We have met with Ohaneze and other Igbo leaders and they have set different committees to articulate the goal. We also as leaders, we want to hear from the masses and hear from those in political offices and appointive offices and, the civil service both at the federal and states on the areas of marginalization.\n“Some of them might be illusions, you know, but I continue to insist that our people that are occupying political offices at the federal level, and the civil service should also identify with our people, because a lot of our people in these places don’t identify with their people. And so we continue to shout marginalisation, we should start from them, they should be able to tell us what they have done. We need to see their faces, we need to identify with them so that the people will appreciate the level of marginalisation so to say. So, this is our position. We are still going to come with some points, if there are merits to meet with Mr. President, then have data to have a tet-a-tet over the matter, but I think things are getting better in South East. “\nAsked what he was doing on the continued Monday sit-at-home even though IPOB has suspended it, he said, “Well, I think it is not more or less complying to the directive of IPOB or no IPOB, suspended or not suspended. It is a question of fear.\n“You know, the easiest thing to do is to carry weapon and kill somebody, and that’s what happened in the past. And that’s why some people in South East are afraid of coming out. Even if you go now to the street and say that… or you hold AK 47. You see everybody will desert the street. So it’s not a question of compliance. It’s a question of fear.\n“If the security agencies can have enough personnel in the South East, you’ll find out that no South East man wants to miss a day of work. They like to work, they are into trade, commerce, and they want to earn their daily living.\n“So this is something that the nation Nigeria must know. And it’s something that security agencies must know. Security agencies must know that they owe south East people the duty to protect their lives. And this is the reason why it appears that in some states, there is a compliance of sit at home, even though like you said, IPOB has said, it’s suspended.\n“But it’s the worst thing to happen to south East because it will destroy the economy of South East.

A group of Nigerian youths not favourably disposed to going ahead with this month’s general elections,due to the inability of many registered voters to collect their Permanent Voter Cards,PVCs, protested to the headquarters of the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, yesterday,to demand postponment.\nThe group, under the aegis of Forum for Democratic Change,FDC, led by its National coordinator, Solomon Chuks, said going ahead with the election this month,will disenfranchise Nigerians.\nChucks,who presented the group’s protest letter to the INEC chairman, Prof. Attahiru

instruments of votes has not been fully separated around Nigeria.\n“Those people who actually remain under scorching sun to sign their names for these PVCs have not gotten these things, yet elections are fast approaching,”he said.\nHe said the action of the group was the demonstration of its anger against the commission to effectively and successfully distribute the items to their legitimate owners before the commencement of the polls,asking INEC to shift the elections so that it can take care of the situation before the elections commence.\nHe said: “I want to correct one impression. This is not a protest. It is a procession to register the grievances of the Nigerian masses as regards the coming election. The Nigerian masses believe that what is worth doing is worth doing well.”\nThey chanted for the polls postponement citing the challenges in the Permanent Voters Cards (PVCs) distribution and avoiding injustice to the large number of Nigerians who could not get their PVCs.\nThe group, which met at the Unity Fountain, in Abuja, matched to the INEC headquarters, holding banners and placards that advocate for the election postponement.\nSome of the placards raised by the marching youths had inscriptions such as: “An injustice to one is an injustice to all; “INEC do the right thing”; “We demand for the extension of election to allow Nigerians exercise their franchise”; “Election is for general participation, not for selective few”;Don’t disenfranchise Nigerians” among others.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"http://www.vanguardngr.com/2015/02/protesters-storm-inec-office-demand-election-postponement/","2":"515","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999847412"},{"0":"If men were God, I won’t be Governor-elect, says Abiodun\nWinner of the March 9, governorship election in Ogun state, Prince Adedapo Abiodun, on Sunday declared that if some “men were God,” he would not have become the Governor – elect of the state.\nAbiodun who revealed that what had kept him going in the journey of life despite daunting challenges is his absolute and unshakeable faith in God, saying such faith was anchored on the message of Christ in Mark 11:23, which assured that an unwavering faith could relocate a mountain from one point to another.\nThe successful entrepreneur, oil magnate and real estate player made this known at St. James Anglican Church, Iperu, his home town, during a Thanksgiving Service to appreciate Almighty God for protection and victory at the gubernatorial poll in the Gateway state.\nProminent personalities at Thanksgiving Service include former Ogun and Ekiti State governors, Otunba Gbenga Daniel, Otunba Niyi Adebayo, Kwara state Governor-Elect, Alhaji Abdulraheem Razaq, Senators Buruji Kashamu, Gbenga Kaka, Gbolahan Dada, Biyi Durojaiye, Senator Solomon Adeola (aka Yayi), Prof Toyin Ashiru and Otunba Bimbo Ashiru.\nAlso in attendance are Dr Femi Majekodunmi, Prince Segun Adesegun, Chief Toyin Okeowo, Ogun West Senator-elect, Chief Tolu Odebiyi, Otunba Rotimi Paseda, Hon Kayode Oladele, royal fathers, among others.\nThe Governor – elect on the ticket of the All Progressives Congress (APC), recalled that he was pained and heartbroken in 2015 when he lost in the contest for the Ogun East senatorial seat but kept pressing forward undaunted because an inner voice was telling him he still has a vision yet to be accomplished.\nHe pledged to run an equitable, just, accountable and a transparent government which would create a public, private partnership for the benefits of Ogun state, the citizens and residents.\nAbiodun said: “my victory has a hand of God. My friends and people around me were asking, “Dapo, what has kept you going ahead in your ambition? What has propelled you? But I remained focus in God and unshakeable. For you to succeed, you don’t have to have doubts in your mind.\nRead Also: OPC greets Sanwo-Olu, Abiodun\n“In my spirit, I have a mission for my country. I didn’t give up. For you to succeed, you should learn to get up and go. Also, you should have convictions.\n“I always refer to the book of Mark 11:23. Honestly if men were God I wouldn’t have been here. In the 90s when I came back from the university, I offered to serve the people of Ogun state but I came second in that contest.\n“Immediately after the primaries I joined Otunba Gbenga Daniel and campaigned for him, eventually he became governor.\n“Again, In 2011 I joined hands with the incumbent governor(Ibikunle Amosun) to win the election. In 2015 I offered to become the senator but I wasn’t successful in that race but I was pained and heartbroken but I didn’t give up because something continued to tell me that I have a vision which is yet to be unaccomplished.\n“Today, what I want you to take home from here is that we should never give up because many times when we meet disappointment, it is just an avenue to close a window for a double door to be opened.\n“I want to assure you that we would lead an equitable and a transparent government which will create a public , private partnership for all, so help me God.\n“I want to thank you all for been here today. We would have postponed this thanks given service until after inauguration but we want to quickly acknowledge the fact that this is an act of God.\n“Few days ago, I was with one of the paramount rulers in the state to thank him for his support and that which was rendered by his people and he said to me that, even the leafs are singing and dancing over your victory.\n“I pray may all of us enjoy this kind of victory in our individual homes in Jesus name.”\nIn his sermon, the Archbishop Ecclesiastical Province of Lagos, Olusina Fape, said it is God that made Abiodun Governor – elect for a purpose in Ogun state.\nFape said Abiodun’s value could only be determined when he begins to effect real and positive changes in the lives Ogun people and the state.\nHe advised the Governor – elect to shun sycophants and surround himself with people of integrity when assembling members of his cabinet, praying that God would help him to succeed.\nFape also advised him not to allow himself to be carried away by the excitement and euphoria of electoral victory, lest he forgets those who God used to help him to the position of a Governor after being sworn – in.\nThe Archbishop who also doubles as the Bishop of Remo diocese of Anglican Church, urged him not to turn his back on the structure of the All Progressives Congress(APC) in the state as it provided him the vehicle on which he rides to power.\nFape said: “A stream that forgets its source will definitely go dry. It is not that we don’t have people with credible character in this country, but our problem is nepotism.\n“And I will advise you to select able people of Faith to be able to be a ruler over hundreds and thousands of men and women.\n“There are many things yearning for attentions at this auspicious time you are coming in as governor.\nYour father and mother are your first destiny helpers. So, in your own case, as governor, you have become parent to all and sundry in Ogun state.\n“Ask God for destiny helpers to work with you to be able to take Ogun State to a greater height.\n“As a consumate entrepreneur, we know your antecedent, you have not come to steal the state funds to build your house, but have been blessed already.

She said to do a comparative analysis of President Goodluck Jonathan and General Muhammadu Buhari! Among her interlocutors, the suggestion instantly elicited an argument. How does one compare day and night? Is not the former resplendent light and the latter pitch darkness?\nThe conversation should actually be one of contrastive analysis, beginning with how both men appropriated political power. Dr. Goodluck Jonathan was elected President of Nigeria in a ballot declared by both local and international observers to be, in every respect, better and more credible than the ones that led Chief Olusegun Obasanjo and Alhaji Umaru Musa Yar’Adua to Aso Rock, the Nigerian seat of the presidency.\nIn contradistinction, Major General Muhammadu Buhari toppled the Nigerian Constitution on the last day of 1983 in order to become the Military Head of State. The common denominator here is that both men attained the political leadership of the country, Jonathan by the people’s mandate and Buhari through the barrel of the gun.\nThis makes Buhari a very lucky man indeed, given what obtains in other countries whose historical circumstances are afflicted by the aberration of military dictatorship.\nTake the example of the Greek Colonels who seized power on April 21, 1967 and made an elongated mess of the cradle of democracy until July 24, 1974 when, utterly discredited, they were forced from office. Less than a year later, the elected government of Konstantin Karamanlis had the members of the sacked junta arrested, detained and put on trial for high treason and insurrection.\nFour ring leaders of the Colonels’ Coup – Papadopoulos, Pattakos, Makarezos and Ioannidis were sentenced to death; the sentences were later commuted to life imprisonment. Hundreds of other officers were equally handed long stretches behind bars, to teach them that “the head is bigger than the body!” But, what do Nigerians have?\nThe longest streets in the major towns and cities are named after those who toppled the constitution, who went on to enjoy two pensions – one as retired military brass and two, as retired heads of government! That explains why Buhari is today running to be President of Nigeria – for the fourth unprecedented time.\nBut to return to the contrastive analysis. In March 1976, General Olusegun Obasanjo, as head of the military junta, appointed Buhari the Federal Commissioner (Minister) for Petroleum and Natural Resources. That same year the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) was created with Buhari as its Chairman; he held both positions until 1978.\nDuring his tenure, however, $2.8 billion allegedly went missing from the accounts of the NNPC. The allegation set off a major national controversy that, in 1980, prompted President Shehu Shagari to inaugurate the Crude Oil Sales Tribunal of Inquiry, headed by Justice Ayo Gabriel Irikefe, to establish the veracity or otherwise of the story. Although the Tribunal could not substantiate the allegation of the missing billions, its limitation lay in the unexplained failure to summon Generals Obasanjo and Buhari, who as Head of State and Oil Minister/NNPC chairman respectively, controlled oil sales during the period in question.\nFollowing that missing billions saga, Buhari had it in for the national media which he held responsible for introducing the story, using it almost to the pointof turning the country into something of a tinderbox. He got his pound of flesh back when he seized power in December 1983 and enacted the notorious Decree Number 4 of 1984 which comprehensively circumscribed and emasculated press freedom.\nPresident Jonathan, on the contrary, reacted with enlightenment and vision to negative press. During Buhari’s dictatorship, the social media did not exit. Not even in fictional works. But both the orthodox and social media descended on Jonathan with extreme prejudice, abusing, calumniating, castigating, denigrating, disparaging, lambasting and pillorying him on 24/7 basis.\nFurther, they homed in on the President’s wife, ceaselessly and incessantly ridiculing her, claiming that her English was not only atrocious but also rendered in accents unbecoming of a First Lady. Her traducers didn’t depose any reasons why Dame Patience should speak English with cadencies and tonal inflections of Queen Elizabeth ll.\nThey were wrong on her English because content analysis of the spoken English and grammar of her predecessors did not confirm that any of Mrs. Victoria Aguiyi-Ironsi, Mrs. Ajoke Muhammed, Mrs. Sefinatu Buhari, Mrs. Maryam Babangida, Mrs. Maryam Abacha and Mrs. Stella Obasanjo excelled her in those departments. Yet, not one of these blessed First Ladies was ever subjected to any disrespect or obloquy on account of perceived diffidence in diction and elocution.\nHow did President Jonathan react to all of the bad faith? Wearing a smile, he carefully skirted around the howls of execration to hand Nigeria its first and only Freedom of Information (FOI) Act. General Buhari told CNN’s Christiane Amanpour that “If Nigeria does not kill corruption, corruption will kill Nigeria.” How have both men been tackling the cankerworm?\nBuhari tried politicians in military tribunals and handed then sentences that ran into hundreds of “Calendar Years”! Not one of those afflicted with such Draconian backlash served up to a year in jail. They were all set free. Not a single one of them is perceived to be corrupt on account of their trial by Buhari’s kangaroo courts.All that may be three decades ago.\nToday, a key Buhari supporter is reported to own the following on account of having served as Governor: two massive hotels, many shopping complexes, an airline, a concession company, an amusement park, numerous estates and countless media organizations. What does Buhari have to say on this score, given that non-tolerance of corruption is a cardinal pillar of his electoral campaign? Nothing!\nBut President Jonathan has been fighting corruption with institutional reforms. His government introduced the Integrated Payroll System which employs the use of biometrics to check the scourge of ghost workers, 66,000 of whom had been fished out as at the last count,thereby saving the government some N139 billion in annual,phantom paychecks. The Jonathan government ended the 40-year old corruption in the fertilizer sector. The government halted the corruption by resolutely removing government from direct procurement of fertilizers.\nIn January 2012, President Jonathan also moved to wipe away the corruption tied to oil subsidies. But a very well-known opposition character fuelled daily protests in Lagos, paying and feeding vagrants and professional agitators to mass at the Freedom Square, to engineer instability.\nMany opposition voices claimed there was monumental corruption at the NNPC. They mentioned sums ranging from $10 billion to $50 billion as having been plundered. This immediately led to a national uproar. The Senate Committee on Finance, chaired by Senator Ahmed Makarfi, investigated the allegation and, despite being people by many APC members, concluded that it was devoid of truth as no money was missing at the NNPC.\nThe Committee described the allegations as “misleading and highly destabilizing.” Heedless, the APC ran with the narrative, generating so much pointless heat. Unlike Buhari who flew off the handle when $2.8 billion allegedly disappeared under his watch at the NNPC in the late 1970s, President Jonathan ordered a forensic auditing of NNPC’s books.\nDr.NgoziOkonjo-Iweala, the Finance Minister, appointed PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), one of the biggest and most renowned auditing firms in the world, to carry out the forensic audit of the NNPC. Like Makarfi’s Senate Committee, PwC also found that there was no truth whatsoever in the allegations of missing money at the NNPC, lending further credence to the Jonathan administration’s fight against corruption through reforms !\nWhat about the other contrasts – including those in the areas of the economy and national security – between Dr. Jonathan and Alhaji Buhari?

Sources confirm that anxiety in the church has risen to a deplorable level, putting everyone on their toes and further complicating reports of threats by the rebels that they are not only out to assassinate the image of the Dr Chris, but to bring the church to ruins.\nThe last one week has been one of uneasy calm as church members are on tenterhooks waiting for the bubble to burst. If the storm eventually breaks, it would not be a bolt from the blue, thanks to one of the rebellious pastors who unexpectedly broke ranks with his conspiring colleagues and spilled the beans, alongside another conspirator who opted out of the plot when those who conscripted him to give false testimonies against the prophet failed to honour the monetary terms of the engagement.\nDespite these setbacks, feelers from the camp indicate that the showdown will go on as planned.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"http://www.vanguardngr.com/2017/01/angry-pastors-plot-church-general-overseer/","2":"474","3":"Religion","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999885559"},{"0":"File photo; Tinubu and Buhari – leaders of ACN and CPC\nBy Femi Aribisala\nONE month ago, the APC had whipped its supporters into frenzy in believing it is bound to win an election it really has no chance of winning. In truth, if the election had been conducted then for chairman of the EFCC, Muhammadu Buhari would have been declared winner by a landslide. However, with postponement of the election, a lot of water has passed under the bridge. Even Buhari’s self-styled credential as Mr. Integrity has unraveled.\nBuhari’s entire campaign posture for the 2015 presidential election stands on two shaky grounds. He fashions himself as Mr. Integrity; the implacable enemy of corruption in Nigeria. He is the one who reportedly is going to ensure that corruption is a thing of the past in Nigeria. He is also the one who is going to destroy the Boko Haram in the twinkling of an eye; even though a number of months ago, he was negotiating for amnesty and golden handshakes for the insurgents, and they nominated him as their preferred middleman in any truce negotiation with Nigeria.\nThings have not gone too well for the Buhari campaign since the postponement of the election. He did not help things by disappearing off the political radar for virtually two weeks. By the time he re-surfaced, Boko Haram was toast. We no longer needed Buhari’s vain promissory notes to deal with the insurgency. One after another, town after town were recovered from the Boko Haram. In many respects, they have been routed as the Nigerian army came into its own after having received its new consignment of weapons.\nAs a result, we are no longer hearing anything from Buhari about whipping Boko Haram. All he had left was his anti-corruption mantra. But that one also came to grief with the airing of AIT’s tripartite documentary entitled: “The Lion of Bourdillon.” This alleged that Bola Tinubu, the self-styled national leader of the APC, is steeped in corruption. It claims Tinubu is the biggest landlord in Lagos, and maintains he has acquired so much property through very sharp practices.\nWhile the veracity of these allegations is yet to be ascertained beyond reasonable doubt, the documentary has brought to the fore the flies in the anti-corruption ointment of Buhari. The truth is that corruption in Nigeria is not the exclusive preserve of the PDP. It is also the chronic ailment of the APC. Neither is corruption only the malaise of the Federal Government; it is equally the malaise of state governments, including those ruled by the APC. Indeed, Murtala Nyako of the APC was impeached and removed as governor of Adamawa State partly because it was alleged that he had corruptly enriched himself with government funds.\nThe question then is this: Does Buhari’s so-called zero-tolerance for corruption extend to his APC colleagues? Will Buhari, in the unlikely event that he becomes president, go after APC thieves as well as PDP thieves? Or will he turn a blind eye to APC thieves and molly-cuddle them? Suddenly, the anti-corruption searchlight turned on to Buhari and his friends, and just as suddenly, we discovered what some of us have always known: that Buhari, the Emperor of Anti-Corruption, has no clothes.\nBuhari’s response to the issue of corruption in APC ranks reeked with sheer hypocrisy and double-standards. Like charity, Buhari’s anti-corruption must begin at home in the APC if it is to be credible. However, Buhari is not inclined to prosecute his friends. Instead, he came up with a pronouncement that virtually rubbished his anti-corruption posture. He said: “Whoever that is indicted of corruption between 1999 to the time of swearing-in, would be pardoned. I am going to draw a line, anybody who involved himself in corruption after I assume office, will face the music.”\nInsurance for corrupt supporters\nThis means as long as you steal money between 1999 and 2011, you have nothing to fear under a Buhari presidency. This is, of course, an insurance policy for his corrupt supporters, assuring them that they would have nothing to fear by giving him their vote. Buhari did not come out in strident support of Bola Tinubu. He did not come out to tell the world that, contrary to the AIT documentary, the Bola Tinubu he knows is a man of unimpeachable integrity. Instead, he told the world that if there are thieves among his friends, they can rest assured that he would pardon their thievery.\nWhen President Jonathan pardoned the former governor of Bayelsa, Diepreye Alamieyeseigha, a man who had been convicted of corruption and was a refugee from justice from Britain, Nigerians were incensed. This was rightly seen as the president condoning corruption. One would have thought this kind of thing would not occur with a man who talks anti-corruption day and night. However, in the case of Buhari, he would not only pardon one corrupt associate, he would pardon them all.\nWhen asked how he was going to get funds to revitalise the economy, Buhari stated that he was going to get all corrupt past leaders and officials cough out their stolen money. This was nothing but a nonsensical policy. It is bizarre and odd for Buhari to think he can run Nigeria, revamp the educational system for example, by recovering stolen money. Where will he get this money from? Who will give it to him? Would such recovered money not amount to a storm in the teacup?\nBut now that he has dumped this anti-corruption charade in favour of a blanket pardon for the corrupt, it is clear that political reality is beginning to erode Buhari’s highfalutin campaign grandstanding. It is equally significant that Buhari’s new stance on corruption comes coincidentally after AIT documentary on “The Lion of Bourdillon,” where one of his most important allies was accused of corruption. Clearly, it is high time Buhari stopped deluding Nigerians that he is genuinely anti-corruption and that he can eradicate corruption in Nigeria by sending corrupt politicians to jail.\nBuhari was Nigeria’s head-of-state for a period of 18 months in the 1980s. At the time, he ran so rough-shod over the Nigerian judicial system that the Nigerian Bar Association proscribed Nigerian lawyers from appearing in any of Buhari’s kangaroo courts. Buhari sent both corrupt and non-corrupt politicians to jail, sometimes for up to 300 years. Nevertheless, corruption was not eradicated. It continued unabated because it was not addressed structurally. Even the practice under Obasanjo of shooting armed robbers by firing squad in Bar Beach failed to stop armed robbery. All it did was to brutalise the Nigerian public.\nJonathan’s effective approach\nSurely, the more reasonable and effective method is to remove the avenues for corruption. This is what Goodluck Jonathan has been doing. He has sanitized the payroll system by removing some 50,000 ghost-workers, saving the country a whopping N200 billion in the first instance. He has removed the fertilizer middlemen; saving Nigeria hundreds of billions of naira. He has sanitized the electoral register. Over three million ghost voters have been removed; one million in Zamfara State alone. He is going after corruption in the oil sector with the Petroleum Industry Bill.\nIn the vainglorious case of Buhari, it did not help matters that he fought corruption with corruption. He interfered blatantly in the judicial process. The judge who sent Fela to jail later went to apologise to him in hospital afterwards that he did it under government duress. Nevertheless, some members of the Nigerian public, baying for the blood of corrupt politicians, hanker back to the high-handed days of the Buhari era, when the human rights of innocent Nigerians were violated on the altar of anti-corruption, and some Nigerians were even judicially murdered under heinous retroactive decrees.\nWhat Buhari is not telling them is that he has no power to do this under today’s democratic dispensation. Buhari goes on the stomp and says: “When we come into power, anyone who steals Nigerian money will end up in Kirikiri Maximum Prisons. We are going to make sure that Nigeria’s wealth belongs only to Nigerians.” But the truth of the matter is that, in a democracy, the president does not have the judicial power to send anybody to Kirikiri. If the EFCC does not prosecute, the president cannot become the chairman of the EFCC. If the judges do not convict, Buhari cannot transform himself into a judge.\nAll those who have been deceived into believing that Buhari will just become president and begin to lock up corrupt politicians left, right and centre are dreaming. In the unlikely event that Buhari becomes president, he will neither have the power to do so, nor the inclination to do so. The reason is simple: many of the thieves are his friends and allies in the APC. Buhari talks change, but he is running around with the old breed of politicians. You can always tell a lot about a man by the composition and character of his friends.\nBuhari fashions himself as Mr. Integrity, nevertheless, he was not averse to serve under Sani Abacha, one of the most corrupt heads-of-state in the history of Nigeria. Even more significant, Buhari insisted that Abacha was not corrupt at all. On the 10th anniversary of Abacha’s death, Buhari told incredulous Nigerians that all the allegations of looting the treasury leveled against Abacha were “baseless.” He said: “ten years after Abacha, those allegations remain unproven because of lack of facts.”\nBuhari held this position in spite of the millions of dollars of Abacha’s loot recovered from banks around the world, and in spite of the fact that the Abacha’s family signed a formal agreement to return over $1 billion of such monies to the Nigerian government. We can see therefore that, from the point of view of Buhari, only the PDP has the copyright on corruption. Every allegation of corruption leveled against his friends and financiers must surely be “baseless.”\nIt is this kind of double standard that prompted Buhari to jail Vice-president Ekwueme while only putting President Shagari under house arrest. Fela Anikulapo-Kuti poked fun at this in one of his songs. He said: “Driver commit accident Buhari lock conductor.” Given the many corrupt drivers that abound in Buhari’s APC’s, we can anticipate that he will only be interested in locking up conductors in the unlikely event that he ever becomes president.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"http://www.vanguardngr.com/2015/03/buhari-and-the-lion-of-bourdillon/","2":"2386","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999713898"},{"0":"By Ben Agande\nA major disagreement has erupted between the special adviser to the President on Media and Publicity,Dr. Reuben Abati and the Senior special assistant to the president on Public affairs, Dr. Doyin Okupe, as the former, yesterday, publicly disowned the later, over the reason for the establishment of the 176 Special Forces Battalion of the Brigade of Guards.\nWhile the senior special assistant to the president on Public Affairs, Dr Doyin Okupe said the establishment of the battalion was because of the threat posed by the fundamental Islamic sect, Boko Haram, the special Adviser to the president on media said the establishment of the Battalion of the Brigade of Guards was not established to protect President Goodluck Jonathan alone.\nIt would be recalled that Senior Special Assistant to the President on Public Affairs, Dr. Doyin Okupe, told journalists that the battalion was established to protect the president from the Boko Haram sect.\nBut speaking with Journalists yesterday, the Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Dr. Reuben Abati said that the new battalion, though part of the Brigade of Guards saddled with the responsibility of presidential protection, was not meant for Jonathan alone.\nAccording to him, the approval for the creation of the battalion preceded Jonathan’s Presidency adding that it was to meet the provision of the Nigerian Army Order of Battle which recommends that Brigades must have three battalions.\n“The approval by the Nigerian Army Council to establish that battalion was given on May 4, 2010.

Anybody that feels what they have done is wrong can go to court. They will meet the governors there. All the govs would have to do is to show them the law, the constitution, sections 24, 40, 45. That is it.\n“What the state governors have done is legal, so why should they bother? Let the FG try to go to court. It is a case that must fail if they go to court. They have not set up a parallel police outfit. No. the constitution says it is your duty to protect the interest of yourself and others and join together in doing so. So simple. The case will be so easy to win.\n“The Amotekun outfit is a protective and supportive outfit established by the governors of the Southwest. It has its roots in the 1999 Constitution and the previous constitutions before it – 1960, 1963.\n“Section 24 of the constitution provides that ‘it shall be the duty of every citizen to make positive and useful contribution to the advancement, progress and well-being of the community where he resides’. Well-being means security of life and property. How many Nigerians realise that they have a duty to assist and to protect the interest of the community and themselves?\n“Section 40 goes further that ‘every person shall be entitled to assemble freely and associate with other persons, and in particular, he may form or belong to any political party, trade union or any other association for the protection of his interests’.\n“When you put these two together, it shows that all of us have the duty to associate whether as Yoruba people or as state people to ensure that lives and properties are safe. The Amotekun outfit has its roots in the constitution. It is constitutional, it is legal, it is proper”.\nBabalola, said he was confidently sure that if the outfit had been established about 10 years ago, the issues of killings, kidnappings and other banditry actions could have been reduced drastically.\n“What I have just said is that it is to support the police, support the government in their duty to ensure that there is peace, there is safety of property, safety of lives. It is a good idea. It is belated but it is lawful and constitutional.\n“All that the AGF said is that Article 45 of the constitution, second schedule gives to the FG the exclusive power to manage the police, he did not say that sections 20, 40 and 45 are abrogated. They cannot abrogate it.\n“The sections I have quoted are superior to the schedule he is talking about and in any event, the governors have not set up a parallel police outfit, what they have done is to set up a supportive and protective organ to assist the police and in their communiqué, they said it would report to the police.\n“The law says you can join together in association to assist the police. How can the police or any government be angry about this? In fact, the FG should really thank the governors and blame them for coming too late because if this outfit has been on in the last 10 years, we would not have all these kidnappings, crimes.

From the threads of our regional, ethnic and religious diversities we must continuously weave a vibrant collage of values that strengthen the Nigerian spirit.\n“The coming National Conference should not be about a few, privileged persons dictating the terms of debate but an opportunity for all Nigerians to take part in a comprehensive dialogue to further strengthen our union.\nHe hoped that the conference will not result in parochial bargaining between competing regions, ethnic, religious and other interest groups but an objective dialogue for the way forward of Nigeria boost harmonious balance among the three tiers of government.\nOn terrorism he said: “My dear compatriots, as we celebrate our centenary, the security situation in some of our North-Eastern States, sadly remains a major concern for us. Just yesterday, young students, full of hopes and dreams for a great future, were callously murdered as they slept in their college dormitories in Yobe State. I am deeply saddened by their deaths and that of other Nigerians at the hands of terrorists. Our hearts go out to their parents and relatives, colleagues and school authorities.\n“We will continue to do everything possible to permanently eradicate the scourge of terrorism and insurgency from our country. We recognise that the root cause of militancy, terrorism and insurgency is not the strength of extremist ideas but corrupted values and ignorance.\n“That is why our counter-terrorism strategy is not just about enforcing law and order as we have equipped our security forces to do. It also involves expanding economic opportunities, social inclusion, education and other measures that will help restore normalcy not just in the short term, but permanently.\n“I want to reassure Nigerians that terrorism, strife and insecurity in any part of Nigeria are abhorrent and unacceptable to us. I urge leaders throughout Nigeria to ensure that ethnicity and religion are not allowed to become political issues.\n“I hope and pray that one hundred years from now, Nigerians will look back on another century of achievements during which our union was strengthened, our independence was enhanced, our democracy was entrenched and our example was followed by leaders of other nations whose ambition is to emulate the success of Nigeria; a country that met its difficulties head-on and fulfilled its promise.”","1":"http://thenationonlineng.net/nigerias-union-non-negotiable-jonathan-insists/","2":"754","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999828339"},{"0":"SPECIAL REPORT: How Disobedience of Court Orders Weaken Rule of Law, Human Rights In Nigeria\nNEWS DIGEST – Nigeria is most populous black nation in the world and has the largest economy in Africa. With independence gained in the year 1960, Nigeria has gone from one successive government to another , notably the uninterrupted democratic government enjoyed between 1999 till date.\nSince the return of democracy, there have been core issues regarding governance in the country and chief among the issues are respect for human rights and respect for the established and set-up constitution of the country.\nIn this report, Olanrewaju Oyedeji takes a look at how disobedience of court orders by government authorities has weakened the rule of law and also threatens human rights in the country.\nChief among the agencies often found wanting in the disobedience of court orders is the State Security Service, established on June 5, 1986, before coming the state security service, it was known as National Security Organization.\nThe security service is also a department of the Ministry of Defence.\nOne of the popular cases of such abuse is that of the leader of the Shiite Islamic Movement of Nigeria. The incident started after altercation members of the Islamic Movement of Nigeria and Soldiers escorting the Nigerian Chief of Army Staff, Tukur Buratai. The incident led to a reported death of over 300 Shiite members .\nAfter the incident, Mr El-Zakzaky and his wife Zeenah were detained on charges of murder, the Kaduna state government stated that during the incident that led to the massacre, a soldier, Corporal Yakuku Dankaduna, was killed.\nHowever, in 2016, a federal high court ordered the release of El-Zakzaky and his wife while ordering payment of N50m to Shiite leader and his wife for ‘violating their rights by being held in unlawful custody’ , this pronouncement was made by Justice Gabriel Kolawole. The SSS however failed to obey this court order, the basis for such was that keeping El-Zakzaky was for his own safety.\nIt was not until after about five years of illegal detention that El-Zakzaky and his wife were acquitted and discharged by the Kaduna state high court on 28th of July, 2021.\nAnother instance of disobedience of court orders is with Omoyele Sowore, a former presidential candidate and democracy activist, was held in detention despite a November 6, 2019 bail order by an Abuja Federal High Court. The Department of State Security Services (DSS) should promptly release him.\nThe detention led to public outcry and condemnations , the state security service had charged Sowore for treason after planning a protest tagged “#RevolutionNow”. The police said it already deemed the planned protest an act of terrorism .\nMr Sowore and other organisers of ‘RevolutionNow’ movement also condemned the federal authorities for lying against them that the protest, would be violent.\nIn Sowore’s case, the court had threatened to imprison the Directorate of State Security Director General.\n“In a “notice of disobedience to order of court” issued by the court and addressed to the DSS DG, the Federal High Court directed the boss of the secret police to comply with its directive or face grave consequences, which includes “commitment to prison”.\nAmnesty International also reported that the Nigerian Attorney General defied an Abuja Federal High Court order to hand over the soldiers who were allegedly responsible for killing three policemen in Taraba state in August 2019.\nAnother prominent case of such disobedience has to do with the former National Security Adviser, Sambo Dasuki. Mr. Dasuki is accused of diversion of $2.1 billion and illegal possession of fire arms.\nAlthough Mr. Dasuki was granted bail on at least six different occasions by various courts, the Nigerian government has persistently refused to comply with the court orders.\nIn 2015, the SSS failed to release Dasuki despite court order stating same.\nAfter over four years in detention, Dasuki was eventually released by the Buhari’s administration. The court of appeal in Abuja, noted that the DSS and its Director-General acted outside their constitutional powers on the long period of the detention of a Nigerian citizen and imposed a fine of N5 million on them to be paid to Dasuki as compensation for breach of his fundamental right.\nThe Nigerian government have also disobeyed other court others, in case of a human rights lawyer, Charles Ogbonna, a human rights lawyer held by the State Security Service. Ogbonna, a lawyer was arrested for posting articles criticising the Okezie Ikpeazu-led government in Abia State, via his social media page.\nShortly after the arrest, he was arraigned alongside another person at a magistrate court in Umuahia for alleged cybercrimes and for allegedly publishing false and threatening messages through the internet against Mr Ikpeazu.\nFive ‘Buhari-Must-Go’ activists commenced a contempt suit against the director-general of the State Security Service (SSS), Yusuf Bichi, for disobeying the court order for their release from custody.\nThe activists commenced the contempt suit with the filing of a ‘Notice of Consequences of Order of Court, also known as Form 48, on July 30, to push for the jailing of the SSS boss. On August 4, 2021, two days after filing the contempt case, the protesters were released by the SSS after the earlier disobedience of court orders by the secret service.\nThe spate of disobedience of court orders have continued unabated leading to tensions about the respect for democracy in the country.\nThe Nigerian Chief Justice, Tanko Mohammed in 2019, had vowed to resist disobedience of court orders, although the situation continues without any sign of dwindling.\nA report by Amnesty international noted that the Buhari’s administration has disobeyed 40 court orders as at November, 2019.\nKolawole Olaniyan, legal adviser to Amnesty International, opined that President Muhammadu Buhari has shown “stunning disregard for the rule of law and human rights, ignoring Nigerian judges on at least 40 occasions”. The London-based lawyer, who also accused the President of treating judges with disdain.\nThe Human Rights Measurement Initiative noted that Nigeria’s score for economic and social rights falls within a ‘very bad’ range.\nJudicial Activism, the Only Way Out- Lawyer\nA lawyer and public affairs analyst, Awosusi Kehinde while weighing on the issue noted that the country is drifting towards dictatorship and the only way out is for those who are responsible for such decisions to be held responsible. He opined that there is a need for judicial activism if the menace will be curbed.\n“There is a need for judicial activism such as punishing heads of agencies that flout court orders. The disrespect for courts does not naturally portray the country well, and does not also portray them as a respecter of human rights, we are fast drifting to the era of authoritarianism, should things continue like that” he noted.>Disobedience of court orders not in interest of Nigerians-SERAP\nThe deputy director of Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP), Kolawole Oluwadare, while weighing on the issue noted that disobeying court orders is not in the interest of Nigerians. He urged judges to be decisive in holding the sanctity of the judiciary.\n“Disobedience of court orders is not in the interest of Nigerians, whether as regards human rights, socio-economic rights or other rights as it were, you would understand that the 1999 constitution has concept of separation of powers and checks and balances. When government decides to disobey the court, they are not only disobeying the constitution but also disrupting the balance of a constitutional democracy.”\nKolawole posited that the judiciary must rise up to the occasion by ensuring that there are punishments for disobeying court orders, according to him, this will help in serving as a deterrent to others.\n“Judgment of the court must be obeyed, if the law is continually disobeyed, it means that the essence of the law has been lost” he stated.\nDespite the concerns on abuse of court decisions, the President Muhammadu Buhari led administration has continued to restate commitment to rule of law and respect for human rights.","1":"https://newsdigest.ng/special-report-human-rights/","2":"1761","3":"Politics","4":"2","5":"en","6":"0.9999351501"},{"0":"By Dapo Akinrefon\nLEADERS of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, in the South West, yesterday, insisted on producing the national chairman of the party ahead of its forthcoming national convention, saying it is based on equity and fairness.\nThe leaders, who gathered at an extraordinary Summit of the South West PDP, including former Deputy National Chairman of the party, Chief Olabode George; former Ogun State Governor Gbenga Daniel, former Deputy Governor of Osun State, Erelu Obada; Chief Ebenezer Babatope, Senator Bode Olajumoke, Prof. Taoheed Adedoja; former House of Representatives Leader, Mulikat Akande- Adeola; Oloye Jumoke Akinjide; Dr. Doyin Okupe, among others, said the zone was adequately prepared for the coveted seat.\nIn a 14-point communiqué read by Chief Olateru Olagbegi, the leaders declared that the South West zone was equally well qualified to lead the party, “given our rich antecedents of history, knowledge and culture.”\nThey also resolved that a powerful delegation of “Yoruba people should be mustered to demand for the position of the chairman of the PDP.”\nThe PDP leaders, argued that the region would no longer be relegated to the background adding that they will not be treated as orphans within the PDP.\nWhile they faulted the Senator Buruji Kashamu- led group, which said the South West was not interested in the national chairmanship of the PDP, they said, “those who renounce the position of the National Chairmanship of our party, do not speak for the Yoruba people.”\nAddressing leaders at the parley, former deputy national chairman of PDP, Chief George, said it was time the national chairmanship of the party came to the South West zone, contending that the zone had a lot of qualified that could occupy the seat.\nIn his speech entitled: “The State of Our Party,” George, said “We will never accept a situation where the Yoruba people are shoved aside to play a subservient, insignificant role in the restructuring and the remoulding of our party.”\nhe added that “there have been some nauseating, and very disturbing noise from some peripheral and provincial characters who claim to speak for our people.

What is your nutritional objective as Christmas and the New Year approach? Of course, this is a season of indulgence, but as a health-conscious individual, you must select your meals and drinks with your overall nutritional goal in mind. And I think pure fruit juice is definitely the way to go,” she said.\nThe wellness expert also urged individuals to adopt a healthy lifestyle to help reduce the risks of cardiovascular diseases such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, obesity and heart diseases. She said that balancing one’s diet with pure fruit juice consumption could reduce the severity in the case of individuals who are suffering from such challenges. “The available evidence relating to 100 per cent fruit juice consumption indicates modest benefits for blood pressure, while there is also an emerging trend revealing inverse associations between 100 per cent fruit juice consumption and risk of stroke.

But the governors of the Southern states are reported to have insisted that they would press ahead with state police, hoping to embark on serious campaign to convince some of their northern counterparts to change their minds before their next meeting. It was learnt that while most of the governors would not support the growing agitation for more states, they were however in support of the rotation of governorship posts among the people of the 109 senatorial districts in the country to give a sense of belonging to all Nigerians.\nThey reasoned that if rotational governorship was introduced, it would eliminate the domination of most states by certain ethnic groups to the detriment of the weaker ones. The source said that Benue and Kogi states were used as examples of states were the minority groups could never rule the states without a rotational arrangement for the political offices in those states.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"http://www.vanguardngr.com/2012/08/why-northern-govs-oppose-state-police/","2":"519","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999904633"},{"0":"Senate mulls Naira devaluation, subsidy removal over COVID-19\nBy Sanni Onogu, Abuja\nThe Senate Tuesday said it is considering the removal of fuel subsidy and the devaluation of the Naira as part of measures to stem the looming economic devastation caused by the spread of the Corona virus (COVID-19) on the country’s economy.\nApart from devaluation of the Naira and removal of fuel subsidy, the upper chamber noted that the review of the Appropriation Act 2020 as passed by the National Assembly is inevitable.\nThe modalities to be adopted in the review of the budget, it said, must be as suggested by the legislative and the executive arm of government.\nThe position of the Senate is contained in the interim report of the Senate Joint Committee on Finance, Appropriations, National Planning, and Petroleum Resources (Upstream) which was set up last week to liaise with relevant agencies of the Federal Government to proffer a way forward for the country following the ravaging effects of COVID-19 on world economy.\nThe Joint Committee was tasked with the “need to assess, examine and suggest to the Senate the urgent steps to be taken on the economic situation of the sharp drop in oil prices and other economic issues caused by the outbreak of the deadly Corona virus (COVID-19) and the uproar between the governments of Saudi Arabia and Russia.”\nChairman of the Joint Committee, Senator Solomon Adeola, in the report, said that the committee during its inaugural meeting with the Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Mrs. Zainab Ahmed, considered a wide range of issues.\nAdeola, who represents Lagos West Senatorial District, said the issues bordered on the current economic realities in the country which includes:\n“The current Appropriation Act 2020 passed by the National Assembly; cost of production of a barrel of crude oil compared with the other counterparts in the petroleum producing countries.\n“The reality of the current situation of the government in terms of number of agencies and parastatals of the government putting into perspective the Oronsanye panel report.\n“The need to prioritise both the social and the real sector of the economy looking at their importance to the overall benefit of Nigeria.\n“Loss of revenue as a result of gas flaring which runs into several billions of dollars.\n“Devaluation of Naira; removal of oil subsidy and other sundry issues.”\nThe Senate adopted the interim recommendations of the committee which among others mandated the Senate joint committee to continue to engage the executive arm of government to keep the Senate abreast of the current ongoing in the economic front.\nOther recommendations included: “That the review of the Appropriation Act 2020 as passed by the National Assembly is inevitable, but the modalities to be adopted in the review of the budget must be as suggested by the legislative and the executive arm of government.\n“That the revenue generating agencies must be alive to their responsibility in line with the Fiscal Responsibility Act passed by the National Assembly and other relevant laws of the National Assembly.”\nAdeola said that the joint committee looked at the issues discussed from two angles, that is, the short and long term solutions.\nAccording to him, “The short term solution is to address the sharp drop in the crude oil price which is creating difficulties in funding the 2020 Appropriation Act as passed by the National Assembly.\n“The long term solution discussed is the need to consider and pass the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB), which is yet to be laid before the National Assembly.\n“This will address the issue of cost of production and gas flaring where the country’s resources are going down the drain and other issues that might affect the petroleum sector.”\nHe noted that as part of the fact finding mission of the joint committee, it sought and received different views from experts in finance and economy on the state of the economy which included:\n“Devaluation of the Naira: while the Federal Government has come out to tell Nigerians that devaluation of Naira is not on its agenda… experts believe will be over as soon as a solution is found to COVID -19 and the price war between OPEC members, Saudi Arabia and Russia, is over.\n“Also experts believe that fund from internal loans and bonds sourced from the Capital Market should be mobilized to fund infrastructural development, a model exemplified by India with population of 1.1 billion people, as this will be much cheaper for us as a Nation.\n“Allowing funds taken out of the country to be returned back into the economy without destroying the anti-corruption war of the president by providing legal instrument to ensure the return of this funds.\n“Experts believe it is time Nigerian should start to look beyond oil as a major source of revenue to the government and ensuring proper diversification of the economy.\n“Experts noted that our shallow policy in agriculture is responsible for our dependency on oil as our major source of income.\n“The government should show more commitment in returning the country as a major leader in agricultural produce both within and outside the African continent.”\nSenate President, Ahmad Lawan, noted in his comments that the country is really in a very challenging period.\nHe insisted that the country should, more than ever before, begin to look inward to ward off threatening economic crisis.\nLawan said: I think we are in a very challenging period but every challenge normally presents some opportunities. I think like Senator Odebiyi asserted that we should take our opportunities.\n“The PIB we had expected by now would have been in the National Assembly but it is not. We had thought we would be able to pass the PIB within this year so that we are able to make our petroleum industry to have the legal framework that investors would find attractive to be here. But we are still expecting that the executive would work faster and harder to present the PIB to the National Assembly in the shortest possible time.\n“But before then, now that we know that it is difficult or even impossible to get the foreign loans that we had built our hopes and implementation of our capital budgets on, I think we have to be very ingenious as a country.\n“We have to look inwards. The Central Bank of Nigeria has come up with some measures that are intended to support the economy.\n“I think it requires a holistic approach, both fiscal as well as monetary policies and if need be we pass a speedy legislation to create an environment where our economy does not collapse; that our economy is sustained with internal resources.\n“But we have to be very careful. If we have to now borrow as a government from the domestic available resources, we should be very careful that we do not crowd out the private sector from getting required loans.\n“So it is going to be walking a tight rope. But we need to have a plan in which both the executive and the legislature come together.\n“We need to listen to them really. I would probably suggest that going forward, in the next one or two weeks that the entire Senate to have a briefing from the Ministries of Finance, Petroleum and the Central Bank so that we are abreast with what is going on and then we can make our suggestions.\n“But meanwhile, our joint committee continues to engage them but this is a very tough time and it is a time that we should not suffer only but we should also benefit from this tough time.\n“We need to understand what the CBN is talking about.

Nagata, the Special Operations commander for the United States in the Middle East while making confidential comments, admitted that he had hardly begun figuring out the Islamic State’s appeal. “We have not defeated the idea,’’ he said. ‘’We do not even understand the ISIS idea/ideology before now.’’\nIn the past years, President Obama has referred to the Islamic State, variously, as ‘’not Islamic’’. Statement that reflected CONFUSION about the group, and have contributed to significant strategic errors about seeking to end the great harm that the group posed to humanity earlier.\nIt’s in seeking to end the confusion about the initial errors about the ideology of ISIS (its aim, mission and ambition) that led to Major General Nagata outlining these Ideologies. This incidentally formed the basis of the extensive investigation and research carried out by PETE HOEKSTRA who incidentally is a senior fellow at the Investigative Project on Terrorism in Washington DC. The investigation by Hoekstra culminated in him warning in an article published recently in Wall Street Journal that ‘’BUHARI IS NIGERIA’s PROBLEM, NOT ITS SOLUTION’’\nThis timely warning according to a credible source at the Investigative Project on Terrorism is based on overwhelming evidences that Buhari’s government is implementing ISIS ideology in Nigeria. A country that prides itself as being a secular state.\nThe source will however enumerate and compare few of these ideologies to prove the case against the government.\nAIMS & AMBITIONS\nISIS makes no secret that its ultimate ambition is to create a Global Caliphate secured through a global war – To what end its speaks off ‘’remaining and expanding’’ its existing hold over territories it has captured.\nIn same vein, Buhari has made no secret his ultimate ambition to drive away indigenous people (mostly Christians) from their indigenous communities and occupy through the activities of his fellow Fulani herdsmen. ‘’Since Buhari became the president, the Fulani herdsmen have developed a mentality of WE OWN THE NATION SINCE ONE OF US IS NOW IN POWER. This 4th most dangerous terrorist group in the world has become so emboldened by the tacit support of Buhari also known as the African Hitler Muhammadu Buhari (AHMB). The AHMB’s government simply looks the other way while these killings, driving away and occupying of these indigenous communities continues. However, the government even sometimes boldly makes some flimsy excuses on why it can’t afford to stop the rampaging marauders ’’ the source said.\nSTRATEGY OF PROVOCATION\n‘’Despite the enormous firepower, the resource and technology the USA and its allies can bring to the battle field, ISIS is doing all it can to drag the West into a broader battle. It gruesome murder of American hostages was part of this strategy of provocation; so are their continued attack in France and other soft target attacks around the world. With this provocation strategy “THEY WANT US TO BECOME EMOTIONAL’’. The source added\n‘’In Comparison you will discover that this strategy of provocation is equally being deployed by the Buhari administration, it aims to make their victims to become emotional and retaliate so as to give him an excuse to go on rampage of slaughtering innocent citizens. He fully deployed this strategy against the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) by murdering harmless protesting youths and those who have gathered to pay their respect to their fallen heroes during the recent Biafran Heroes day anniversary at Nkpor on 30th May, 2016 leading to the killing of over 140 defenseless Biafran youths and maiming of many others. The good thing however, is that IPOB has adopted our recommendation and made it clear that it will never be provoked to arm struggle when it is not yet Chukwu Okike Abiama’s appointed time. We are carefully studying these events’’ The source quipped.\nERADICATING OF CHRISTIANS AND SHIA MUSLIMS\n‘’ISIS ideology as a militant Sunni Muslim group is also fixated with purifying Islam, and that means eradicating Christians and Shia Muslims. ISIS has already shown extreme cruelty towards Shiites, most notably been the slaughtering of more than 1,500 Iraqi air force cadets in Tikrit in June 2014 amongst others’’. The source recalled\n‘’On the other hand, AHMB’s government in following the footstep of ISIS leader, Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi has even shown more cruelty in dealing with the Shia Muslims in the country. Most notably been the slaughtering of over 1,100 Shia Muslims in an operation lasting a whole 3 days from 12 -14 December, 2015 over a mere accusation of not allowing rite of passage to the government’s Chief of Army Staff, Tukur Buratai . Christians are equally not left out in Buhari’s cruelty as his Fulani herdsmen keeps attacking and slaughtering Christians whilst the government keeps making one excuse or the other of the existence of one ECOWAS Protocol that would not allow it stop the killings of those its supposed to protect’’ said the disappointed source.\nEMPLOYING THE WE & THEM DIVISON STRATEGY\nOne of ISIS most dangerous ideology is the embroiling of USA and the West in a land war according to the source, ISIS reasons this would give Muslims no choice but to come to the defense of the Caliphate ‘’the we’’, setting up a global confrontation with ‘’the them?’’ Noted the source\nThe source equally believes that this ideology was responsible for Buhari’s government cleverly creating the 97 percenters versus the 5 percenters division in the country thereby leading to a division where none had existed. ‘’In embroiling the country in the 97% vs 5% division, Buhari had reasoned that the former will have no choice but to come to his defense whenever the need arises. Why a leader in a democracy will be engrossed with such a division creating strategy is what I can’t fathom’’ wondered the source.\nWANT TO SEEN TO BE FIGHTING FOR MUSLIM MINORITIES\nISIS sees itself as coming to the rescue of Muslim minorities the world over. ISIS claims ‘’we don’t enjoy life until we liberate the Muslims everywhere, and until we retrieve Al-Quds (Jerusalem and regain Al-Andalus (Spain) and Conquer Rome’’.\n‘’This must have been what Buhari’s government had in mind when it advocated for the right to self-determination to be accorded the people of Palestine and those of Western Sahara who are seen as Muslim minorities before the UN in 2015 while turning around to accuse that those advocating for same right in Biafra (populated by Christians) of treason’’ Concluded the source.\nThe good news according to the source is that more and more people and governments of the world are becoming increasingly AWARE that BUHARI IS NOT NIGERIA’s SOLUTION BUT HER REAL PROBLEM. The source is emphatic that the coming days will witness international public outcry and anti Buhari exposures. When this starts happening don’t forget that you heard it first here.\nWritten by Chuks Ikedigwe.\nCan be reached: [email protected]","1":"http://m.thenigerianvoice.com/news/225100/buhari-implementing-isis-ideology.html","2":"1646","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999313354"},{"0":"A chieftain of the New Nigeria People’s Party (NNPP), Folasade Aliu has said that the party’s flag bearer, Rabiu Kwankwaso is not stepping down for his counterparts in the All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Tinubu; and in the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Atiku Abubakar.\nAliu, a National Campaign Secretary for the NNPP, spoke on The 2023 Verdict, Channels Television’s special election programme on Tuesday.\nThere have been reports of a possible merger between the NNPP and some of the bigger parties for the presidential poll but Kwankwaso’s camp has been consistent in dismissing the claims as untrue.\nAccording to Aliu, Kwankwaso is prepared for the task and he has been vocal in engaging Nigerians about his plans for the country if he wins the February 25 poll.\n“We are preparing for this and we are telling Nigerians one-on-one the love we have for this country,” she said.\n“So, the issue of Kwankwaso is stepping down or merging with Tinubu or stepping down for Atiku is absolute nonsense.

We have interacted with them, collected some data and they have been cooperating very well.\n“This stage is about government setting the pace, we are already taking with other organizations that have indicated interests to key into it, we are in the stage of tidying up issues with them to see how they can come in but so many organizations have indicated interests. Part of the six-pillar is that government has the responsibility of providing some infrastructure and security.”\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"https://www.vanguardngr.com/2020/01/fg-state-to-fund-pilot-ranches-in-plateau/amp/","2":"746","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999980927"},{"0":"ScarletNews.com is a distinctive domain name that exudes energy and urgency.

The President and Commander-in-Chief never inaugurated any panel anytime and anywhere in Nigeria”, he argued.\nHe contended that the Panel lacked the locus standi, competence and legal vires to receive complaints, investigate and initiate legal proceedings in matters connected with assets he declared to the Code of Conduct Bureau in 2007 and 2015.\n“The Constitution of Nigeria 1999 (as amended) has laid down a set of guidelines for the behaviour of public officers. It is known as the Code of Conduct, which is contained in the Fifth Schedule to the Constitution.\n“The Code of Conduct Bureau is an institution created by the Constitution and charged with ensuring compliance with the Code; whilst the Code of Conduct Tribunal is responsible for enforcing it.\n“It is important to invite the court’s attention to the fact that the Recovery of Public Property (Special Provision) Act, CAP R4, LFN, 2004 gives jurisdiction to the Federal High Court under Section 2(2)b which is not only inconsistent with the Code of Conduct Bureau and Tribunal Act but inconsistent with section 251 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria which did not include code of conduct matters under the jurisdiction of the Federal High Court\nWe refer to Trade Bank Plc vs Lagos Island Local Govt (2003) supra.\n“My Lord, we submit that the constitution has already provided for the body to undertake this investigation and prosecution of offences related to and connected with asset declaration. It has done so and we are therefore bound to observe it under the doctrine of covering the field.\n“This sole panel has no power to receive complaints, investigate and initiate criminal proceedings against the respondent concerning issues of Assets by a public officer.\n“We submit that the Federal High Court is a special court with limited jurisdiction as contained in Section 251 of the 1999 Constitution.\n“Violating the Code of Conduct for Public Officers is not one of the matters in respect of which jurisdiction has been conferred on the Federal High Court under Section 251 of the Constitution.\n“We urge the Court to dismiss the Ex-parte application filed in the name of the Federal Republic of Nigeria”.\nWhile refuting allegation that he did not declare all his assets, Ekweremadu, in a nine paragraphed affidavit deposed to by one John Amoke, alleged that contents of a Will he lodged at the Probate Registry of the High Court of Justice of Enugu State, was tampered with and unlawfully altered by retired Chief Judge of the state, Justice Innocent Azubike Umezulike.\nHe said the Obono-Oblah led Panel never notified him of its investigation of petition the retired CJ filed against him based on his distorted Will, saying he was never at any time, queried by the CCB concerning any discrepancy in assets he declared before it.\nConsequently, Ekweremadu, prayed the court to dismiss FG’s ex-parte motion for being incompetent.\nMeantime, FG, on Tuesday, argued that Ekweremadu lacked the right to be heard by the court since its application was brought ex-parte with the aim of preserving all the assets in issue.\nFG’s lawyer, Mr. Bala Dakum who is from the chambers of Mr. Festus Keyamo, SAN, argued that the fact Ekweremadu got wind of motion to freeze his assets, did not grant him the entitlement to be heard.\nMore so, FG, via its own five-paragraphed affidavit that was deposed to by one Yohanna Shankuk, alleged that Ekweremandu has already sold some of the properties in question.\nIt said Ekweremadu’s motion was only “a delay tactics to frustrate the substance of this suit”, saying “there are reports that the Respondent is already hurriedly selling off the assets”.\nFG said its motion was to stop the Respondent “from dissipating the assets in question whilst investigations are ongoing”.\nJustice Binta Nyako subsequently fixed April 26 to determine whether or not Ekweremandu should be heard before the court could grant ex-parte orders with regards to the assets in dispute.\nAssets FG wants the court to freeze over Ekweremadu’s alleged failure to declare them, are located at No. 11, Evans Enwerem Street, Apo Legislative Quarters, Apo, Abuja, Plot 2633 Kyami, Abuja, Housing Estate (Plot 1106 CRD, Cadastral Zone 07-07, Lugbe, Abuja, Plot 2782 Asokoro Extension, Abuja, Houses at Citi Park Estate, Gwagwalada, Abuja, Plot 1474 Cadastral Zone BD6, Mabushi, Abuja, Congress Court, Abuja, Flat 1, Block D25, Athletics Street, (24th Street) Games Village, Abuja and Plot 66, 64 Crescent, Gwarimpa Estate, Abuja.\nThose in London are Flat 4 Varsity Court, Harmer Street, WIH 4NW, London, 52 Ayleston Avenue, NW6 7AB, London.\nOther properties in Dubai and USA are; Room 1903, The Address Hotel, Downtown Dubai, The Address Boulevard, 3901, Dubai, 2 Flats of Burij Side Boulevard (the signature), Dubai, Emirate Gardens Apartment No. EGG1/1/114, Dubai, Emirate Gardens Apartment No. EGG1/115, Dubai, Apartment No. DFB/12/B 1204, Park Towers, Dubai, Flat 3604, MAG214, Dubai and Villa No 148, Maeen 1, The Lakes Emirates Hills, Dubai.\nAs well as 4507 Stella Street, Bellavida Estate Kissime, Florida, USA, 2747 Club Cortile Circle, Kissime, Florida, USA and 2763 Club Cortile Circle, Kissime, Florida, USA.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"https://www.vanguardngr.com/2018/04/breaking-fg-cant-seize-assets-nigeria-us-uk-dubai-ekweremadu-tells-court/","2":"1668","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9998722076"},{"0":"SEATTLE — Microsoft has made its most ambitious move in years to reassert itself in a technology market it once dominated.\nThe software giant said Monday morning that it would acquire LinkedIn in a $26.2 billion cash deal.

In this interview, he spoke on the recent accident involving the convoy of the Kogi State governor, which claimed the life of Professor Festus Iyayi. He also fielded questions on the aviation minister’s saga, national conference and the inconclusive Anambra governorship election and other national issues. Excerpts:\nDoes the family of late Prof. Festus Iyayi have any cause of action against the Kogi State government?\nSurely, the family of Late Professor Festus Iyayi has a cause of action against the Kogi State Government for the executive recklessness that led to the untimely and gruesome death of the don.\nThe media reported the circumstances of the tragic death of Professor Iyayi. It is undoubtedly clear that it was the negligence of a driver of a vehicle in the governor’s convoy that hit the vehicle conveying Professor Iyayi, the impact was so much that he was killed instantly. To that extent the Kogi State government is vicariously liable while the driver who caused the accident is criminally liable in the circumstance.\nDoes the Kogi State government have any civil or criminal responsibility considering the fact that the governor’s convoy was responsible for the late professor’s death?\nUnlike Governor Idris Wada who enjoys immunity from criminal liability, his drivers are not immune from prosecution. So all the drivers indicted in the three road accidents involving the governor in the last few months are liable to be prosecuted for violating traffic laws. This is a clear case of manslaughter. In each of the cases the Kogi State government is obligated by law to pay compensation to the families of the four people who were killed in the three accidents.\nCan the driver of the killer vehicle be proceeded against personally or is it a case of vicarious liability ?\nAltogether there are five accidents involving the governor, the deputy governor and Speaker of the House of Assembly of Kogi State in the last two years. This is not surprising in view of the revelation by the Federal Road Safety Commission boss that Governor Wada did not allow the drivers in his convoy to be trained by the FRSC like the other 700 government drivers across the country. The statement is a very serious indictment which may aggravate the damages payable to the families of those who were recklessly killed by the governor’s convoy.\nThe latest accident was the third involving the governor’s convoy this year alone. How do you react to this?\nThe Iyayi’s family and the ASUU are going to take advantage of the killing of Professor Iyayi to prevent further carnage and loss of precious lives on our roads through executive lawlessness. The use of siren is going to be reviewed. In the countries where siren is manufactured its use is restricted. It is not for harassing road users but for making way for fire fighting vehicles, ambulances and the police in case of emergencies. With all the congestion or traffic jam on Lagos roads, Governor Babatunde Raji Fashola, SAN does not use siren or chase people out of the road. Why then should the governor of any other state intimidate road users to the extent of killing them? Such executive impunity has to stop.\nThe Senate has referred the aviation minister’s issue to its committee on aviation, instead of her appearing before the Senate as earlier reported. Do you think anything will come out of it?\nIt is a desperate attempt to shield the Aviation Minister,Ms Stella Oduah from prosecution. But neither the Presidency nor the Senate can exculpate her from the allegations of grave economic and financial crimes which have been leveled against her. More so, that the Bureau of Public Procurement and the House of Representatives Committee have indicted her. Both the ICPC and EFCC are also probing her while the Presidential probe Panel on the matter has submitted its report. There is no hiding place for her.\nWhat is your take on US categorizing Boko Haram as foreign terrorist organisation?\nThat is the internal affair of the United States. Since the Federal Government has proscribed the terrorist body it has no business applauding the decision of the United States. After all, the Federal Government earlier kicked against the stigmatization of the Boko Haram sect as a terrorist society.\nDo you think the Federal Government is sincere with the planned National Conference?\nThe Federal Government has been sincere about it. In fact, President Jonathan has announced that the resolution of the planned Conference will be sent to the National Assembly for consideration in the ongoing review of the Constitution. This in effect means that the national dialogue or conference is an expanded town hall meeting to collate the views of Nigerians with respect to the amendment of the Constitution. Since the resolutions of the Conference are not sovereign or binding on the Government including the National Assembly it is likely to be a complete sham.\nWould you like to put the record straight on Governor Chime’s wife issue?\nThere isn’t much to put on record as far as Mrs. Clara Chime’s case is concerned. Although I do not require the permission or written authorization of a victim of human rights abuse to intervene I was instructed by Mrs. Chime to take up her case. She never disowned me. What she said at the nocturnal press briefing by Governor Sullivan Chime was that she did not contact me directly but that a friend might have done so on her behalf. That statement cannot be faulted. Mrs. Chime sent an e-mail to one of our friends and directed her to contact me.\nThe e-mail was forwarded to me. Her mother, Mrs. Patience Igwe also sent me an SOS to free her daughter from detention. I took up the brief without charging professional fees. In actual fact, I took pity on Mrs. Chime and requested the Inspector-General of Police to free her from illegal detention. It is interesting to note that Governor Chime confirmed the allegation that he had detained his wife. In a desperate bid to justify the illegal detention he said he did it in\nher own interest. As if that was not enough the governor said his wife was mentally challenged. For goodness sake there was no basis for such defamatory statement. To the best of my knowledge, Mrs. Clara Chime is not suffering from mental disability. She is logical and sensible in her reasoning. Happily, we have succeeded in liberating her and she is now enjoying her freedom.\nWhat’s your assessment of the Anambra governorship election which PDP and APC and Labour Party, LP, candidates called for its cancellation?\nThe Anambra governorship election has confirmed that INEC requires a total reorganisation. It is not sufficient to accuse some officials of having sabotaged the election. Professor Attahiru Jega must accept responsibility for the gross mismanagement of the election and move speedily to identify all such saboteurs in the INEC and relieve them of their positions. Under Professor Maurice Iwu, the INEC was a machinery for fixing results of elections and for all kinds of electoral manipulations. Apart from the removal of Professor Iwu and the appointment of Professor Jega nothing has changed in INEC. In other words the rigging machinery has remained intact.\nHence, INEC has continued to conduct terribly bad elections with lack of materials, lateness of materials, late arrival of materials, non-payment of electoral officers etc. Unless the INEC is re-organized and restructured it is going to bundle the 2015 general elections. If the INEC cannot successfully conduct the gubernatorial election in one state, where is the assurance that it is prepared to handle the presidential, legislative and governorship elections in other parts of the country, in one day? Was the 2011 general election not postponed midway due to insufficiency of electoral materials?\nI can assure that those who sabotaged the Anambra governorship will smile to the bank. They won’t be sanctioned. Owing to official impurity the manipulation of the electoral process is not going to stop so soon. Nigerians should brace up for further abolition of another electoral process.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"http://www.vanguardngr.com/2013/11/kogi-govt-criminally-liable-iyayis-death-falana/","2":"1709","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999847412"},{"0":"By Ediri Ejoh & Genevieve Aningo\nAmidst controversies over appropriate pump price for petrol, reports of the National Bureau of Statistics, NBS, has indicated that petrol marketers in16 states of the country are selling the product significantly higher than the N145 maximum price stipulated by the federal government.\nWhile the marketers have subtly canvassed for upward review of the ceiling on the bases of upwards movement in exchange rate, the key factor in the petrol pricing template, many stakeholders have argued that the marketers were being selfish in pressuring the government for their financial gains at the expense of the economy and the citizens.\nAlso the federal government through both the presidency and the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, NNPC, have resisted the pressure saying that the increase was not acceptable.\nGovernor of Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN, Mr. Godwin Emefiele, has also indicated that at N145 per litre the marketers were already making huge margins on the exchange rate of N280/USD1.00, arguing that the further depreciation of Naira recently only narrowed the profit margin instead of wiping it out.\nBut according to the NBS report, as at last month Nigerians across the 36 states bought petrol at average of N147 per litre, above the fixed price cap of N145 per litre.\nSpecifically, the reports show that in 16 states the price ranged from N145.90 in Imo State to N164.30 in Bayelsa State.\nIn the report, all oil producing states are running the most expensive fuel price, except Edo and Delta.\nOther states that recorded significant mark-up on the benchmark price include: Abia, Akwa Ibom, Anambra, Bauchi, Bayelsa, Benue, Borno, Cross River, Ebonyi, Enugu, Gombe, Kaduna, Kebbi, Kogi, Kwara, Nassarawa, Niger, Rivers and Sokoto, with a range of N146 and N164.3 per litre.\nMeanwhile, within this period, no regulatory agency has been able to check the discrepancy.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"http://www.vanguardngr.com/2016/09/marketers-sell-petrol-n145l-16-states/","2":"457","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9998226166"},{"0":"Former PDP Chair Mu’Azu, Kashim Imam, others escape death\nSeveral prominent Nigerians including the immediate past National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP),Mallam Adamu Mu’Azu,former Special Advise on National Assembly,Alhaji Kashim Imam and former National Chairman of the defunct CPC,Senator Rufai Hanga, narrowly escaped death in the Thursday tragedy in Mecca,The Nation can now report.\nMultiple eyewitnesses at the scene said Mu’Azu,Imam and Hanga had joined millions of other pilgrims in stoning the devil when the stampede started.\nOther prominent Nigerians close to the scene were the PDP Youth Leader Abdullahi Maibarisa, Deputy Comptroller General (Operations) of the Nigerian Immigration Service Mr.Muhammad Babandede, and a former member of the House of Representatives.\nThe hajj rituals continued yesterday although with security beefed up across the various points in Mecca.\nAlhaji Umar Farouk a Nigerian pilgrim from Zaria, Kaduna state said by SMS that “in spite of the tragedy, pilgrims are determined to perform their hajj duties.”\nAnother Nigerian pilgrim,Alhaji Abdullahi from Kano asked Saudi Arabia to stop what he called long-existing discriminatory practices during hajj.\n“ The designation of pilgrims into categories of Non Arabs, Africans and others ensures discriminatory treatments and arrangements,” he said.\nAccording to him pilgrims from US, UK, Canada and European countries are always treated with courtesy whereas every Muslim,irrespective of his colour,should enjoy equal treatment.\nKing Salman has ordered a comprehensive review of arrangements for the annual hajj pilgrimage that sometimes involve some three million pilgrims.\nThe Saudi authorities are in the process of reaching being expected to reach the Nigerian and other countries’ officials anytime from now, with the list of the victims according to nationalities.","1":"http://thenationonlineng.net/former-pdp-chair-muazu-kashim-imam-others-escape-death/","2":"399","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9960044622"},{"0":"By Pini Jason\nTHIS is not a defence of Chinua Achebe. He does not need one. No amount of abuse can dent his global standing. Ban or burn all his books, as someone suggested, he would only feel sorry for you, not angry.\nAchebe has since outgrown certain sentiments. On the other hand, if Chief Awolowo were alive, he would have cautioned people against some of the vituperative effusions, especially by people craving relevance with Awo’s name and who cried more than the bereaved.\nAwo’s daughter, Ambassador Tokunbo Awolowo-Dosunmu, made one of the most mature reactions. She simply said if what was said to have been written was true, she was disappointed but would not say more than that until she read the book!\nAwo was an accomplished and fulfilled man before he died. Nothing said now by ethnic jingoists and fake Awoists can add any value to his eminent standing.\nWhat the nation has witnessed since the publication of an excerpt of a review of Achebe’s There Was A Country: A Personal History of Biafra by Guardian of London is a classic decline of intellectual discourse in Nigeria.\nAt the time the needless controversy ensued, not more than 10 people would say they had read the book. The first few copies available in Nigeria at the material time were review copies sent to some journalists by Dr. Chidi Achebe.\nOthers were those who travelled to countries where the book had been published and were able to buy a copy, or were sent a copy by friends abroad. Therefore all those who plunged into attack and counter-attack based on excerpts of a review simply embarrassed themselves. It really did not mean that the outcome would have been radically different if more Nigerians read the book.\nI say so because Nigerians read with two brains. While one is reading what was written, the other is busy formulating what the reader believes you wrote! It is therefore not surprising that, in this kind of situation, the combatants in the futile but emotionally charged controversy quickly took cover behind ethnic parapets!\nLast week I finished reading a copy sent me by Chidi and I felt more disappointed with the entire hullabaloo about the book and the abuses that went all round. In the first place, the duty a writer of Achebe’s status owes humanity is to shock it with the truth whenever it develops amnesia.\nAchebe did just that with his book, 42 years after the civil war. He seems to have succeeded in rousing us from our amnesia, except that the intellectual debate is yet to ensue, and except also that, in Nigeria, my truth is a lie, and your lie is the truth! Secondly, it was wrong to make it seem as if Awo was the subject of the book. He was not even the important point in the book.\nThe controversial reference to Awolowo did not appear until page 233 of a 333-page book, including appendices, notes and index! Nevertheless, those who have been reading will tell you that Achebe did not say anything new about Awolowo nor has he ever hidden his views about the Yoruba leader!\nNature of Nigerian debate\nIt is the nature of Nigerian debate that those who insistently make Awo an ethnic champion often turn round to accuse others of diminishing Awo’s status, making me wonder if those who swear in Awo’s name really knew him. For example, Femi Fani-Kayode who effusively described Awo as “much loved leader of the Yoruba” easily turned round, tongue in cheek, to accuse Achebe of “ethnic chauvinism”.\nThere are not many Yoruba who locate Awo beyond the ethnic enclave to a national stage, unless you tell me that Nigeria begins at Mokola and ends at Dugbe! It took Chief Emeka Odumegwu-Ojukwu to posthumously elevate Awo to “the best President Nigeria never had”.\nOne thing any reader of Achebe would confess is that the man tries his best to choose his words carefully. The controversial portion of the book came under the subheading, The Case Against the Nigerian Government. There he took not only Awolowo, but also, Allison Ayida and Anthony Enahoro to task.\nAnd he prefaced his criticism of Awo’s motive for employing starvation as a weapon of war with the words, “it is my impression that…” We can debate whether Achebe’s impression was wrong without name calling, ethnic baiting or profiling.\nAnd that is, if we have any intellectually honest reason to read that portion in isolation of everything else he wrote elsewhere in the book about Awolowo and Yoruba nation!\nA few hard questions can be asked: Did Awo have ambition for power for himself and for the advancement of his Yoruba people? Yes he did.\nThat was an ambition he spent all his political life pursuing. Did Awo see the dominant Igbo as obstacle to that desire? You may argue that Awo was not the only one who saw the Igbo as obstacle but you cannot deny what happened to Zik in Ibadan in 1951.\nHear my friend Ayo Opadokun: “What he (Achebe) expected was that Awo should fold his arms to allow the Igbo race led by Zik to preside over the affairs of the Yoruba nation” (The Nation 5 October 2012). Further, he admitted that “it was clear that the East and West were in contest for socio-economic and political power”. Tell me, could Achebe have put the matter any clearer than Opadokun did?\nJust as Achebe conceded that there was nothing wrong with Awo’s aspirations, there was nothing wrong with contest between the East and West for socio-economic and political power, except that no ethnic group in Nigeria wants to contest with Igbo on equal terms or compete on a level playing field. Nigeria obviously felt happy that it has removed the Igbo obstacle by inscribing the Federal Character in the constitution.\nAnd we cannot deny that there was a sing-song of “Igbo domination” in the years leading to the crises that led to the coup and the war. Unfortunately, the fear of “Igbo domination” not only created an enduring conspiracy to cripple the Igbo but also left an unsettled issue of citizenship that has created the dichotomy of “settler” and “indigene” for which blood flows in the Plateau today.\nIn defence of Awo\nI think it was futile to defend Awo on the matter of starvation as a weapon of war after he proffered his own personal defence. In his well publicised 1983 interview, Awo did not deny the charges levied against him by Biafrans.\nHe simply rationalised his actions. Respected elder statesman and one of the living authentic Awoists, Chief Ayo Adebanjo apparently based his defence of Awo on this interview (Thisday 13 Oct 2012). We can appreciate Awo’s rationalisation or disagree with them. I disagree with some.\nAwo said he went to Calabar, Enugu and Port Harcourt shortly after their liberation. “I saw kwashiorkor victims…Then I enquired what happened to the food we are sending to the victims…but what happened was that the vehicles carrying the food were always ambushed by the soldiers…and the food would then be taken to the soldiers to feed them, and so they were able to continue the fight”.\nThe flaw in this rationalisation is that people may conclude that Awo stopped food supply because Biafran soldiers were hijacking them. In the first place, Nigerian NEVER supplied food to Biafra.\nWhatever food Nigeria supplied was to those “liberated” areas behind Biafran lines. Those areas were under the control of the Nigerian army.\nTherefore if the vehicles conveying the food were ambushed by soldiers, it could only be by Nigerian soldiers! Food that came into Biafra were direct from World Council of Churches, Caritas, International Red Cross and French NGOs.\nThese supplies were directly administered by the churches, priests and Red Cross through their feeding centres.\nThe humanitarian disaster in Biafra was exacerbated when Nigeria closed the air corridors by shooting down some of the relief planes. The argument about using land corridors approved by Nigeria to supply food to Biafra was still on till the war dramatically ended.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"http://www.vanguardngr.com/2012/10/there-was-a-country-there-was-starvation-1/","2":"1839","3":"Politics","4":"2","5":"en","6":"0.9998817444"},{"0":"HypeNigeria.com is more than just a domain name – it's a symbol of your business's connection to the ever-evolving Nigerian economy.

The cash includes N713.70billion special intervention funds.\nSome governors are displeased that the Nigeria Governors Forum (NGF) plans to pay 2% of the $6.9billion refund to consultants.\nThe 2% is $138,000,000 (N42.228billion at the official rate of N306 to $1).\nAccording to a governor, who spoke in confidence, NGF Chairman Abdulaziz Yari, who is also the governor of Zamfara State, conveyed the agreement to pay 2% to some consultants in a July 29, 2016 letter to the Minister of Finance, Mrs Kemi Adeosun.\nThe letter reads: “Please recall that the Nigeria Governors Forum had at its meeting of May 2016 appointed a Consortium of Financial Consultants to reconcile and recover over-deductions from the Paris and London Club loans due to states and local governments.\n“Also, Mr. President in a meeting with members of the Forum had graciously agreed to pay 50% of the monies due and the balance of 50% paid after due and diligent reconciliation of the accounts.\n“At the last meeting of the Nigeria Governors Forum held in July 2016, the Forum unanimously resolved to pay a fee of 2% to the consultants as their professional fees for the services rendered.\n“Pursuant to the Forum’s resolution therefore, I am requesting that the payment of the consultant fees should be deducted at source from each state’s entitlement and paid directly to the account details of the consultants as attached with.\n“Consequently, we crave the indulgence of the Honourable Minister to effect the wishes of the governors when implementing Mr. President’s directives.”\nBut the aggrieved governors said they were not happy realising that “one or two governors” brought the lead consultants after each state had engaged its own consultants. “Our colleagues can also not be offering consultancy services to us through some proxies”, he said, pleading not to be named because of “the sensitivity” of the matter.\nThe governor went on: “At the end of it all, states are expected to part with N42.2billion to consultants who are not primary sources of the loan records. We were shocked that out of the N19billion consultancy/legal fees paid into the NGF accounts, most consultants hired by states have not been paid a farthing.\n“The bulk of the job of the reconciliation of loan refunds is being done by officials and consultants or financial advisers from each state, the Debt Management Office (DMO), the Ministry of Finance, the Office of the Accountant-General of the Federation (OAGF).\n“Some of us will resist further deductions from our loan refund. The N42.2billion is outrageous.”\nFollowing protests by states against over deductions for external debt service between 1995 and 2002, President Muhammadu Buhari approved the release of N522.74 billion (first tranche) refund to states pending reconciliation of records.\nEach state was entitled to N14.5 billion or 25% of the amount claimed.\nMrs. Adeosun said the payment of the claims would enable states to offset outstanding salaries and pension, which had been “causing considerable hardship”.\nGovernors had sought for the refund to states and local government areas at a meeting with President Buhari on May 24, last year.\nThe President directed that:\n- a thorough reconciliation be carried out between the states and the Federal Government; and that\n- 50% of the claims submitted by the states be released prior to completion of the reconciliation to support states, most of which are financially distressed.\nBased on the intervention by the President, the NGF, in a letter to the Presidency, said “the total refund claim submitted by states was $6.9billion of which $2.6billion belongs to local governments.”\nThe NGF, in the letter through Yari, added that “the data was obtained from the Revenue Mobilisation Allocation and Fiscal Commission (RMAFC).”\n“The $2.6billion deducted from the local governments is not disputable as the local governments have the powers or capacity to take foreign loans for which the disputed deductions relate to,” the letter said.\nThe Presidency released N522.74 billion (first tranche) to states.\nThe release of the cash triggered a huge controversy, including payment of N19billion consultancy fees and $86million into the accounts of the NGF.\nThe Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) is investigating the alleged diversion of N19billion of which it has traced N3.5billion, allegedly to a consultant and some aides of the Senate President, Dr Bukola Saraki.\nThe latest dimension is non-remittance or “partial remittance” of the share of the 774 local government areas by some governors.\nIt was learnt that some governors hid under the Joint Account System to utilise local government refund for other purposes.\nLocal governments are entitled to $2.6billion of the refund. It is surprising that in some states, local government employees are still being owed about six to 10 months salary arrears, contrary to the spirit of the refund approved by the President,” a source said.\n“Some states got the refund and diverted it to other uses. Others transferred to Joint Account and gave local governments paltry sums.\n“We have the list of states where local government staff have been subjected to untold hardship by governors who have withheld the share of the third tier.\n“What the government expected was that since each local government paid for the loans, its refund should be directly remitted to it to pay outstanding salaries.\n“In a few states, the governors outrightly denied local governments their refund, as if the Federal Government did not release any cash.\n“But we have one or three states where the governors declared the actual refund collected and remitted local governments’ share.\n“We are looking at the activities of the governors and the government may be forced to name them at the appropriate time.\n“Such governors may also be investigated by anti-corruption agencies and they will account for the refund after their tenure.”\nA government source spoke about how the “abuse” of the refund accounted for the strict conditions attached to the release of the more than N500billion in the second tranche.\n“The Presidency will be strict this time around. The good thing is that the disbursement of the second tranche is subject to cash flow or availability of cash for the Federal Government,” the source said.","1":"http://thenationonlineng.net/governors-kick-138m-consultants-fees/","2":"1582","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999237061"},{"0":"Gen.

We should engage these predictions on an intellectual level, testing whether the facts justify the conclusions.\n“But on a practical and public policy level, we must import honesty into our public policy assessments. Firstly, we must identify the problems that need to be addressed. Secondly we must address these problems honestly.\n“Thirdly we must identify the most current and the most appropriate mechanism for addressing these issues.\n“Let me make this clear. My position is not dictated by the fact that foreigners are making these predictions. We don’t even need foreign sources as a reference point. The Nigerian media is awash with alarming news about our problems. My position is dictated by my conviction that Nigeria is precious enough to be saved.\nIt deserves an investment of our time and resources to make Project Nigeria a success. But the starting point has to be an admission that we need to fix things. We need a new mindset about the Nigerian project. Let us start off by admitting the mistakes of the past. Right policies have at times been wrongly implemented. Temporary solutions have often been turned into permanent policies, even though the problems they were designed to address have long been solved”.\nMaking suggestions on how to ensure the continued existence of Nigeria beyond the predicted 2015, General Babangida said, “the issue of the principle of federal character needs to be revisited. In a multi-ethnic, multi-cultural and multi-religious nation, the principle of Federal Character is a sensible one and there is no alternative to it. Each national group must be given a feeling of belonging.\nWhat needs to be refined is the question of standards. Federal character can go hand in hand with merit. 50 years after independence and over 50 years after the establishment of universities in Nigeria, there should be no national groups, no states, no zones, no hamlets without qualified citizens. Therefore there should be no question of employing unqualified people in the name of federal character, just as there should be no question of abandoning the principle of federal character in a Federation.\nPrinciple of federal character\n“We must admit that sacrifices have been made and sacrifices will continue to be made for the survival of this Nigerian project. In the past, maybe there has not been sufficient recognition of the fact that those making these sacrifices have grievances which should have been addressed.\n“Maybe in the past, there had not been sufficient recognition of the fact that each national group has legitimate fears and grievances. Some of the mistakes of the past have now come to haunt us. But let me make one thing clear. Not all these mistakes were made out of callousness or bad faith or malice.\nMost people in office do their best. They act to the best of their ability. Unless we think that our leaders have divine ability, we have to admit that even with all the best of their abilities and even with the best faith and with the best of all intentions, human beings will still make mistakes.\n“That after nearly 100 years of existence, people and national groups still have grievances provide us with an opportunity to address these grievances. That these grievances are of sufficient magnitude for them to demand a dissolution of the nation show the extent of the grievances and therefore it should point to the magnitude of the seriousness with which we should address the grievances.\nFrom the creeks in the Niger Delta to the Sahelian areas of the North, Nigeria is under pressure. Now is the time for us to regard the rescue effort as a joint enterprise to secure maximum benefits for all and not an enterprise to secure temporary advantage for one group over another. We need to arrive at a grand consensus that will move this nation forward rather than a panel-beaten system that satisfies no one except the temporary holders of power.\n“We can face the challenges together, united in the spirit of a joint enterprise and propelled by the belief in the greatness of this country and a commitment to make Nigeria a source of pride and inspiration to the black race”.\nSpeaking on the forthcoming centenary celebrations General Babangida said, “in less than a year, in about 11 months and a few days, we as Nigerians will be celebrating 100 years of our existence as a legal united entity. We have cause to rejoice. During these 100 years, Europe has endured two world wars, Russia had gone through a revolution, a civil war and finally gone from being Russia to Soviet Union and back to Russia.\nDuring this time, Spain and Yugoslavia have gone through horrendous civil wars. During this time, several countries in Asia, including China went through civil wars that almost brought them to their knees.\n“Yet today, Europe is one of the fastest growing economies in the world. China is destined in a few years to become the biggest economy in the world. Yes, during the past 100 years of our existence, we also have gone through a horrendous civil war. The events that led to the war and the war itself have left lasting effects on all of us, including those who were not even born during those events.\n“As other countries have overcome the mistakes in their history and moved on, so we Nigerians also have cause to rejoice that even though in our history we have met with obstacles, we have experienced ups and downs, each generation had sought to the best of its ability to tackle these obstacles. That we are still a united nation is sufficient cause for congratulation.\nOur problems are not over. Nation building is not like an electric switch which you turn on and off. It is a continuous process which makes a heavy demand on government and the people”.\nEulogising Prof. Akinyemi, in whose honour the books were being launched, he said “let me say a word or two about the man we are all here to honour today. That he was my first External Affairs Minister is an established fact. That before then he was the Director-General of this Institute, the Nigerian Institute of International Affairs for eight years is also an established fact.\nThe fact that as part of today’s programme, there is a symposium on the Technical Aid Corps scheme, one of Prof. Akinyemi’s enduring legacy in government, is ample demonstration of the relevance of Prof. Akinyemi to Nigeria’s Foreign Policy.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"http://www.vanguardngr.com/2013/02/how-to-avoid-nigerias-breakaway-in-2015-ibb/","2":"1528","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999961853"},{"0":"This short documentary looks at how easy it is to make fake passports and scam the rich into trusting you with thousands of dollars.\nIf the fraud industry were its own country, it would have the fifth strongest economy in the world, just ahead of the UK.\nMeet the fraudsters who're making a killing from the fastest growing crime on Earth.\nVICE showcases the British fraud industry and the unapologetic mindset of the type of people who turn to that life to make a living.\nIt's interesting to see it from their perspective, but it's nothing short of violating to know that these are the types of people who think identity theft, credit damage and stealing are viable ways to make a living.\nLMFAO.

Photo by Gbemiga Olamikan.\nAs Ohanaeze, IPOB attack FG over Nnamdi Kanu\nBy Emmanuel Aziken, Emeka Mamah & Dapo Akinrefon\nThe Igbo apex socio-political group, Ohanaeze-Ndigbo, has warned the Federal Government against the move to revoke the bail granted the pro-Biafra agitator, Nnamdi Kanu, on the grounds that he breached the conditions for his bail.\nThe Indigenous People of Biafra (IPoB), the separatist group led by Kanu, and a former Chief Whip of the Senate, Senator Roland Owie, joined Ohanaeze-Ndigbo to reject the government move.\nThe development came on a day Arewa youths, who withdrew their quit notice to Igbo people living in the North, said their action was to honour President Muhammadu Buhari.\nMeanwhile, the youths said the goal of the quit notice had been achieved as notable Igbo leaders have disowned the “mad (pro-Biafra) agitation coming from the South-East”.\nThe Federal Government had, on Friday, asked a Federal High Court sitting in Abuja to revoke the bail granted Kanu, who is being prosecuted alongside others on treasonable felony charges.\nThe government alleged acts of serial violation of the bail conditions imposed on the pro-Biafran leader by the court.\nIt explained that instead of the IPoB leader to use the opportunity of his bail to attend to his health needs, as pleaded before the court granted him bail, Kanu went ahead to inaugurate a security outfit known as Biafra Security Service, saying this constituted a threat to national security.\nThe Ohanaeze-Ndigbo, in a response to the government move, yesterday, said it was provocative, biased and a breach of the Constitution.\nThe President of the Igbo group, Chief John Nnia Nwodo, in a statement, noted that the Attorney General of the Federation looked the other way when some Arewa youths committed what was akin to treason by breaching the rights of other citizens and when they withdrew their quit notice did so on qualified terms.\nHe said although he and many Igbo leaders did not agree with the persuasions of Kanu, he, nonetheless, maintained, in a statement that the AGF got it wrong.\n“It has just been brought to my notice that the Attorney-General of the Federation has approached the court to incarcerate Nnamdi Kalu for flouting his bail conditions.\n“I am amazed that the distinguished attorney is prepared to contest the superiority of the provisions of the Constitution on fundamental human rights of freedom of movement and freedom of association over an erroneous judicial proclamation violating those rights. I am equally miffed by the audacity with which the Attorney-General displays his bias without regard to his oath of office.\n“A few hours ago under the watchful eyes of the Chairman of the Northern Governors Forum and in total defiance of the Head of State’s proclamation of the rights of a citizen of Nigeria to live anywhere in Nigeria and to do business anywhere in Nigeria, the Arewa Youths, pretending to withdraw their quit notice gave qualifications to the Head of State’s proclamation, issuing conditions for enjoyment of citizenship status.\n“These same Arewa youths are supposed to have been arrested on the orders of the Governor of Kaduna State and the Inspector General of Police for acts of treason, conversion and sedition. As the Chief Law Officer of the Federation, the Attorney-General looks the other way. He does not go to court to seek an order of arrest or prosecution”.\nNwodo pointed out that Kanu, as a citizen of Nigeria, was free to hold any point of view, no matter how displeasing to anyone, so long as they were not inciting or provoking any criminal activities.\nThe Ohanaeze – Ndigbo leader went on: “I and some Igbo leaders have differences of opinion with Nnamdi on a number of issues. We have been insulted and abused by Radio Biafra but we concede them their right to differ from us. We concede them their nature to be exuberant as youths but we cannot be judgmental about their rights.\n“This is a democracy. In democracies leaders are abused, pelted with rotten eggs and booed at, as the former Edo State Governor was booed in Abuja a few days ago. These acts are not necessarily criminal”.\nHe urged the Attorney-General not to exacerbate the already tense nation by commencing a legal action which portrays him as biased, insensitive and misdirected.\n‘Move to re-arrest Kanu illegal, illogical’\nAlso rejecting the government move, IPoB, in a statement, yesterday, said it was not only a form of terrorism but illegal and illogical, saying Kanu had not committed any offence known to the laws of Nigeria.\nIn the statement signed by its Media and Publicity Secretary, Emma Powerful, IPoB described the request by the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, SAN, as “dangerous, illegal and undemocratic.”\nThe statement read, in part, “We, the IPOB, and it’s leadership worldwide under the command and leadership of Mazi Nnamdi Kanu wish to place the whole world on notice regarding the illegal, unwholesome and undemocratic moves by the APC government led by Major General Muhammadu Buhari to re-arrest our leader Mazi Nnamdi Kanu who committed no crime known to the laws of the Nigerian state.\n“Merely asserting that Mazi Nnamdi Kanu is a threat to the Nigerian government is not a crime unless accompanied by legally definable crime or offence.\n“The Buhari led administration must know that threats and more threats heaped upon intimidation after intimidation does not make IPOB responsible of any crime. “Before President Buhari decides to make a move to arrest our leader, he must first go to court to obtain a court order or else it will be resisted by millions of IPOB members.\n“This singular act by Buhari-led Federal Government is going according to our predictions. We knew that this day would come, so we are well prepared for it.\n“As soon as the illegal, unconstitutionally draconian conditions of the bail were spelt out by Justice Binta Nyako, we knew such a day would come when they will use the cover of broken bail condition to launch an attack… After all, the matter is before a court of competent jurisdiction.\n“When IPOB complained about the inhumane bail conditions, we were advised to approach the court for variation. Now that (some people) are uncomfortable with the conduct of our leader in respect of the same bail conditions, they must also approach the courts to grant their prayers and not try to subvert the legal process by instigating arrest without the permission of the court.\n“Whatever issues the APC government of Buhari has with our leader, Mazi Kanu, must first be presented before Justice Binta Nyako’s court for determination.\n“This latest move by this regime is simply a continuation of the well documented anti-democratic tendencies…”.\nThe Igbo group threatened that should Justice Binta Nyako choose to listen to Buhari and revoke the bail granted to Kanu during his appearance on October 17, 2017, it will ensure 100% compliance with the Anambra elections boycott order.\nAGF overreaching himself – Owie\nIn the same vein, Senator Owie, in a statement, yesterday, said the Attorney-General of the Federation was trying to create problems for the Buhari administration by seeking the re-arrest of Kanu.\n“I urge President Muhammadu Buhari to ignore the AGF on the re-arrest move”, the former Senate Chief Whip and the National Leader of Action Democratic Party (ADP), South-South, said in a statement.\nHe went on: “The AGF does not wish President Muhammadu Buhari administration well. Why did he not file the court action for Kanu’s re-arrest while the President was away in the UK? Why did he not file a court action for the arrest of a Coalition of Northern Youths for issuing a quit notice to Igbo living in the North?\n“Buhari should not allow these toddlers and some others around him to dent, further, the already dented image of the All Progressives Congress (APC), the Federal Government, and should remember always the saying of Mr. H.G. Bohn: `May the man be damned and never grow fat, who wears two faces under one hat’”.\nQuit notice to Igbo achieved goal – Shettima\nWhile explaining why Arewa youths withdrew their quit notice to Igbo resident in the North, yesterday, a top member of the coalition that issued the notice, Alhaji Yerima Shettima, said it was in deference to President Buhari.\nYerima, who is also the National President of Arewa Youth Consultative Forum (AYCF), however, said the goal of the quit notice was largely achieved as Igbo leaders distanced themselves from the pro-Biafra agitation led by Kanu and his group, IPoB.\nAsked what informed the decision by the northern youths to withdraw the quit notice to Igbo, Shettima told Sunday Vanguard in an interview: “In the first place, we considered the fact that we are not agents of destruction. We are agents of building a progressive Nigeria. You will also recall that the reason we went to the extreme of doing what we did was as a result of the mad agitation coming from the South East. No tribe or people will allow anyone to abuse the sensibility of their leaders and get away with it without any caution. So, we felt that the silence of the leaders and traditional rulers of the South East is a conspiracy of silence to allow Nnamdi Kanu to continue with his quest, we felt there was need at that time to do what we did.\n“Unfortunately, time has over taken a lot of things but we have seen that political leaders and leaders from the South East have come out to condemn the activities of the young man. The leaders are also coming out to say that they don’t believe in Biafra but in one Nigeria, it is commendable. There was also pressure and intervention from our leaders, they spoke to us to withdraw the notice and we listened to their counsel. You will also recall that the Sultan of Sokoto called us to intervene, the northern leaders also spoke to us followed by other prominent northern leaders as well as other stakeholders”.\nEven before the president’s return, we had written to the Acting President of our plans to withdraw the quit notice on a particular date. We are not ready to join issues. Anyway, there is nothing bad if we honor our president, Mohammadu Buhari. He says he does not want anything that will divide the country. We have obeyed him. If we do that, there is nothing wrong in that . We are proudly Nigerians and he is the President of Nigeria we are looking for ways to build the nation and not destroy the nation”.\nOn what the quit notice had achieved, the Arewa leader said: “First, we have succeeded in exposing the fraud in the agitation, which has been brought to the fore. Also, we have seen southern leaders and traditional rulers from the South East coming out to condemn the Biafran struggle. We are also seeing the leadership of Ohanaeze Ndigbo coming out to talk about a united Nigeria and condemning Biafra. This is commendable and a plus to Nigeria. The quit notice has achieved the desired result. All we need do is work with those who believe in a united Nigeria”.\nOn the clamour for restructuring, he said: “It the issue for now because the unity of the country is being threatened. I am an advocate of restructuring but we need to consider timing. What we need do is to stabilise the country before we can sit down and talk of restructuring. The North is not against restructuring but it should not be done by this government. We need to wait for another government in 2019 before we can talk about restructuring. Nobody is afraid of restructuring from the north because we want it more than any other person”.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"https://www.vanguardngr.com/2017/08/buhari-made-us-withdraw-quit-notice-arewa-youths/","2":"2754","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999885559"},{"0":"Lagos State Governor, Mr. Akinwunmi Ambode (right), making his remarks during the courtesy visit by former Heavyweight Boxing Champion, Evander Holyfield at the Lagos House, Ikeja, on Wednesday, May 24, 2017.\nLagos State Governor, Mr Akinwunmi Ambode on Wednesday lauded the achievements of five-time world cruiserweight and heavyweight boxing champion, Evander Holyfield, describing him as the greatest living boxer of all times.\nGovernor Ambode, who spoke at Lagos House in Ikeja when he received Holyfield on courtesy visit, said he was personally proud of the achievements of the legend in the boxing field, and described him as a great role model.\nHolyfield, who is billed to slug it out with former Lagos State Governor and National Leader of All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu at an exhibition boxing match, is in Lagos as part of activities marking the Golden Jubilee anniversary of the State, and to also give back to the society through his foundation.\nThe Governor, who described the visit of the boxing legend to Lagos as historic, said there was no better way to showcase sports as catalyst for growth than the collaboration of such an icon as Holyfield.\n“This is exciting and historic moment for us coming at a time Lagos is celebrating the 50 years of its establishment and we want to say a big thank you to Holyfield for collaborating with us to put this as part of events marking the Golden Jubilee anniversary of Lagos State.\n“We believe strongly that in all sectors that we have tried to celebrate Lagos, this is one momentous topic that we really mean to celebrate.

There are very many people that go away from their stardom and not pay back and so many champions have not been able to do anything after leaving the ring but Holyfield stand as an exception.\n“On the other side, boxing should now be in the front burner of sports in Nigeria especially now that a Nigerian, Anthony Joshua recently won as the unified world heavyweight champion.\n“Lagos has the largest concentration of the black people in the world and we just believe that Lagos should be well projected the visit by the boxing legend is also to promote the brand called Lagos,” Governor Ambode said.\nEarlier, Holyfield said he was in Nigeria to give back to the society having achieved so much in life especially in boxing.\nWhile recalling how he started boxing at the young age of 8 and became champion at 9, Holyfield said he felt like quitting after initially suffering defeats but his mother told him to hang on.\n“I became the person I am because I listened, I followed direction and I did not quit even when I lost.

The country’s resources ought to be harnessed and distributed to serve the common good, and not to finance a life of luxury for politicians.”\nAccording to SERAP: “Increasing electricity tariff and fuel price in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic is antithetical to the public interest, the common good, and a fundamental breach of constitutional oath of office.”\nSERAP is also seeking: “an order of injunction restraining the RMAFC from paying the same amount of salaries and allowances to President Buhari, Professor Osinbajo, Dr Lawan and Mr Gbajabiamila until the RMAFC comprehensively reviews downward the salaries and allowances and other emoluments of these top public officers and other high-ranking public officers, in line with Nigeria’s current economic realities, and consistent with the principles of the rule of law.”\nDr Lawan issued for himself and on behalf of all 109 members of the Senate, while Mr Gbajabiamila issued for himself and on behalf of all 360 members of the House of Representatives.\nAccording to SERAP: “A public officer shall not put himself/herself in a position where his/her personal interest conflicts with his/her duties and responsibilities. Personal interest, in this case, is when top public officers like the Defendants continue to receive the same salaries and allowances while asking poor Nigerians to sacrifice and bear the burden of electricity tariff and fuel price hike.”\nSERAP is also asking the court to determine “whether RMAFC can lawfully continue to maintain the same level of salaries and allowances for President Buhari, Professor Osinbajo, Dr Lawan and Mr Gbajabiamila, in light of Nigeria’s current economic realities, and constitutional provisions, and despite their apparent roles in the increase of electricity tariff and fuel price.”\nSERAP said: “Public money is spent as security votes without transparency, and to pay for lavish lifestyles for top public officers including lawmakers, who continue to buy expensive new cars at the expense of taxpayers, the poor and socially and economically vulnerable Nigerians. The National Assembly is also set to spend N27 billion to renovate the National Assembly Complex, as proposed in the budget.”\nThe suit filed on behalf of SERAP by its lawyers Kolawole Oluwadare and Opeyemi Owolabi read in part: “Public duty means showing leadership by example and commitment to the ideals of public service, including by reducing salaries and allowances of high-ranking public officers like the Defendants.”\n“The Nigerian Constitution is founded on the rule of law the primary meaning of which is that everything must be done according to law. It also means that government should be conducted within the framework of recognized rules and principles, which restrict discretionary power.”\n“The court, being the last hope of the common man, must come to the aid of the poor and socially and economically vulnerable Nigerians by granting the reliefs sought by SERAP and 302 concerned Nigerians. Unless the reliefs sought are granted, the Defendants will continue to breach the constitution at the expense of Nigerians living in poverty.”\n“The poor and socially and economically vulnerable Nigerians would be negatively affected by the hike in electricity tariff and fuel price. The increase is contrary to the oath of office by the President to faithfully ensure the well-being and prosperity of the people. Increasing electricity tariff and fuel price is neither in the public interest nor the well-being of Nigerians.”\n“On or about the 1st September 2020, the Federal Government announced a total removal of subsidy from the price of the Premium Motor Spirit, otherwise known as petrol and thereby pushed the price per litre of petrol to N151. The Government had on 19th August 2020 announced an increment of more than 100 per cent in the electricity tariff per kilowatt to be paid by Nigerians who continue to face unjust electricity charges.”\nSERAP is also seeking the following reliefs:\nA DECLARATION that the exercise of the President Buhari’s power to increase the price of petrol under section 6 of the Petroleum Act 1969 and increase of electricity tariff is arbitrary, unjust, unfair, and in breach of the Oath of Office of President contained in the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of Nigeria 1999 [as amended].\nA DECLARATION that it is unlawful and unconstitutional for President Buhari, Professor Osinbajo, Dr Lawan and Mr Gbajabiamila to continue to receive the same salaries and allowances and the same level of budgetary allocations, despite Nigeria’s current economic realities and light of the Public Procurement Act 2007, constitutional code of conduct for public officers, and their respective oaths of office contained in the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution.\nA DECLARATION that the failure of RMAFC to reduce the salaries, allowances and other emoluments for President Buhari, Professor Osinbajo, Dr Lawan and Mr Gbajabiamila and other principal public officers in spite of their respective roles in the increase of electricity tariff and fuel price is in breach of the principle of equality before the law and equal application of the law, and Section 153  [n] and Paragraph [N] 32[b] [c] [d] in Part 1 Third Schedule of the Constitution of Nigeria 1999 [as amended].\nAN ORDER restraining all the Defendants individually and/or collectively, directly or through their representatives and agents from implementing any purported increase in electricity tariff and fuel price until an impact assessment of the effects on the poor and socially and economically vulnerable Nigerians is carried out.\nAND for such further order(s) this Honourable Court may deem fit to make in the circumstances.\nNo date has been fixed for the hearing of the suit.","1":"https://www.channelstv.com/2020/10/18/serap-sues-buhari-nass-wants-court-to-declare-electricity-tariff-fuel-price-hike-illegal/amp/#click=https:///tJnjaso0fm","2":"1626","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.999994278"},{"0":"By Clifford Ndujihe, Deputy Political Editor\nTheir Common features Indeed, Jonathan and Atiku have a few things in common. They were both born in the month of November. While Jonathan was born on November 20, 1957, Atiku, his main and primary political opponent, was sired on November 25, 1946.\nIn their careers, both men had served in the Department of Customs & Excise. While Atiku served the department for 20 years, Jonathan functioned in the service for two years. The two-term former Vice President joined the Customs in 1969 and retired in 1989 after rising to the rank of Deputy Director of Customs, an equivalent of Deputy Comptroller.\nOn his part, Jonathan got enlisted in the Customs in 1975 as a Preventive Officer after his secondary education. He quit in 1977 on securing an admission into the Department of Zoology, University of Port Harcourt.\nIt will not be surprising if the duo deployed the experience they tapped from their sojourn in the Customs into the presidential contest.\nAside the Customs, Atiku and Jonathan are from unique geo-political zones – North-East and South-South. These are the only two zones that have not produced Military Heads of State. And the times people from the two zones occupied the seat of power, they were through democratic means. Nigeria’s first and only Prime Minister, Sir Abubakar Tafawa Balewa hailed from Bauchi, North-East. He occupied the position between 1960 to 1966 through the ballot box. After him, no other person from the North-East has been president or Head of State.\nThe South-South shares a similar fate. It has neither produced a president nor a Head of State until Jonathan appeared on the scene, via a co-incidence of election and divine intervention. He was elected Vice President to late President Umaru Musa Yar’ Adua. He assumed the throne following the expiration of Yar’ Adua last May.\nThat may be where the commonness between both men ends. They have a lot of differences. For a start, Atiku is a Moslem while Jonathan is a Christian. Atiku is from Adamawa State, Northern Nigeria as opposed to Jonathan’s Bayelsa State, Southern Nigeria. Atiku is a polygamist while Jonathan is a monogamist.\nJonathan has one wife, Mrs. Patience Faka (from Rivers State), and two children– Aruabai and Adolphus Ariweri.\nConversely, Atiku has four wives drawn from four ethnic groups, four states and three geo-political zones, who bore him 27 children. The first wife, Hajia Titi, a Christian is from Ilesha in Osun State(South-West zone). The second wife, Rukayat is the daughter of the Lamido Adamawa (North-East). The third, Fatima is a Kanuri, Borno State (North-East) while the fourth, Jamila (formerly Jennifer Iwenjiora) is an Igbo from Onitsha, Anambra State.\nIt is too early to tell if these backgrounds will play a crucial role in the outcome of the PDP primaries and the April 9 elections proper. But one thing is certain, both men are not leaving anything to chance in their quest to be chief occupant of Aso Rock.\nChanging political equation\nThe campaigns and posturing have since changed gear following the emergence of Atiku as the consensus flagbearer of North, according to the nine-man committee of the Northern Leaders Political Forum, NPLF led by Malam Adamu Ciroma last Monday.\nA day after the adoption, Jonathan came out with an advertorial, in many national dailies, urging the electorate to cast their lot with him, the “consensus Nigerian candidate.”\nIndeed, the emergence of Atiku Abubakar has started altering political permutations. Pundits say that the country is about to undergo an interesting phase with the political prospects of a new Nigeria.\nThe political will of the Nigerian nation is about to be tested with the convergence of divergent forces with the attendant far-reaching implications for the polity.\nWith Vice President Namadi Sambo as running mate, President Jonathan has entered the contest with the incumbency factor, Niger Delta factor, South/North factor and a perceived shy, unassuming, articulate, calm and calculating player.\nOn the other side, Atiku, who is expected to come up with a South-East running mate, which sources said might be named before the PDP primaries to sway delegates, is in the arena with Northern hegemony-cum- South factor, acclaimed consummate political gladiator and grandmaster, grassroots mobiliser and strategist as well as an articulate, calm and calculating master player.\nAtiku is also going into the race with the backing of Gen. Ibrahim Babangida, Dr. Bukola Saraki and Gen. Aliyu Mohammed Gusua, who lost the consensus ticket to him and thereafter pledged to collapse their campaign teams into his.\nRaging tussle for PDP ticket\nFor the duo, the primary task now is clinching the PDP ticket, which is a different kettle of fish from the presidential election proper. The ruling party’s primaries would be won by the aspirant that woos the majority of delegates and going by current permutations it is almost a 50-50 chance between them with Jonathan having a slight edge.\nThe President has been endorsed by various groups and stakeholders even though most of the groups are not part of statutory delegates to the PDP convention. As of now, Jonathan has got the endorsement of the South-East, South-South and South-South PDP, Southern governors and a couple of Northern states’ helmsmen.\nPresently, Atiku has the support of some North-West, North-East and North-Central governors and would-be delegates. Sources said he is push hard to get the South-East nod by picking his running mate from the region. He has promised to do a term and relinquish power to the South-East in 2015. Jonathan is yet to make a similar promise.\nTowards this, Alh Abubakar has raised a committee led by former Vice President, Dr. Alex Ekwueme and Dim Chukwuemeka Odumegwu-Ojukwu, to advise him on the choice of a South-East running mate. Leading politicians being considered for the Number Two job include former Senate President, Ken Nnamani, former Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN Governor, Prof. Chukwuma Soludo and Senator Ben Obi among others.\nAtiku to name running mate before primaries\nUnlike what had prevailed in the past, sources said the running mate might be named before the PDP primaries, to sway delegates.\nSources said the Atiku camp is bent on realising the Northern plan of producing the president in 2011 in line with the PDP zoning formula.\nThe plan has four levels. Two has gone, remaining two. The first was to stop Jonathan from running and it failed. The second is to produce a consensus candidate to fight for the PDP flag with Jonathan and it has sailed through.\nIf Atiku did not get the ticket, the next plan, according to sources, is to contest on the platform of an opposition party or root for an opposition candidate without leaving the PDP.\nOn his part, the Jonathan’s team is upping its door-to-door campaign and firming its hold on consenting governors.\nGoing by the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC timetable, both men have between today (November 26) and January 16, a duration of 51 days, depending on when the PDP will hold its primaries, to emerge as the standard bearer.\nImplications of Jonathan, Atiku’s victory\nIf Jonathan wins the ticket, it might be nunc dimitis for the northern hegemony. And if Atiku wins, it might demystify and erode the power of incumbency in the polity. And depending on how the President is ‘humiliated’, he might throw his weight behind an opposition candidate, with the opposition being the beneficiary.\nAs it were, the winner of the race may not be the harder political puncher but one with the longer political stamina and political sagacity.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"http://www.vanguardngr.com/2010/11/atiku-vs-jonathan-the-battle-of-two-ex-customs-officers/","2":"1754","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9996538758"},{"0":"Governor Ben Ayade\n•Calabar is safe – Inuwa, CP\nBy Ike Uchechukwu\nCALABAR- FOLLOWING the relocation of many Igbo businessmen from Calabar and other parts of Cross River State to neighbouring Akwa Ibom and Ebonyi states, the Cross River State Government has introduced a new coding system on commercial vehicles, including tricycles plying the state to curb armed robbery, kidnapping and other crimes.\nExercise to tackle insecurity– Ngagi\nMr. Jude Ngaji, a Senior Special Assistant, SSA, Security to Governor Ben Ayade, told NDV that the measure was to create a data bank of all the commercial vehicle operators in the state with a view to curbing insecurity in the metropolis and the state at large.\n“The operators have all filled forms giving their full details, so, if a case is reported about a vehicle, all we do is simply check the system and know who the owner of the vehicle is.\n“We are being proactive, knowing that these criminal activities happen around us every day and we need to curb them. This is not an indictment on any commercial vehicle operator, but it is something we must do to ensure that most of the common criminal cases are reduced,” he said.\nHe said the state government would handle the cost implications of registering and giving codes to the commercial vehicles in all the local government areas of the state.\n…Govt‘ll bear cost of registration\n“I heard that a token was paid by the commercial operators for the registration and codes, but I am going to order all that to be returned to the operators and see that it becomes the full responsibility of the state government,” Ngaji added.\nThe security adviser, however, called on commercial vehicle operators who use their vehicles to engage in criminal activities to refrain from such as the state would employ necessary methods to curb their activities.\nWe support measure – Ewa, Tricycles Association chair\nReacting, chairman, Tricycle Owners Association of Nigeria, TOAN, in the state, Joseph Ewa said the measure would help in identifying the evil ones, who pose as ‘Keke riders’ to commit various forms of crimes.\n“We have heard numerous complaints of people forgetting their belonging in a keke and they were not brought to the office, so they could be returned to the owners,” he said.\nIt’ll reduce crime – Okon\nAlso speaking, chairman, Unified Commercial Drivers in Cross River, Effiong Okon, said though the system was new in Cross River; it had been in existence in other states and even abroad.\nOkon noted that the development would surely reduce crime as it is easy to identify the new codes boldly written on the vehicles than identifying the number plates on commercial vehicles.\nCrime wave down in C’River – Police Commissioner\nCommissioner of Police, Mr. Hafiz Inuwa, told NDV: “There will always be criminally- minded people in the society but as security operatives, we are very proactive in our action, we are not reactive because we want to prevent crime even before it happens.\n“You must have observed that the crime wave is on the decline as we speak, we have raided a lot of criminal hideouts in the city and we have charged a lot of people to court for various crimes. We know and believe that once that confidence is regained, a lot of people, even new businesses, will come back to Calabar.\n“But I can assure you that Calabar remains one of the safest cities in West Africa, because you can walk the streets till dawn because we have increased patrol and surveillance and we have changed our tactics in a bid to tackle the menace of armed robbery, cultism and kidnapping,” he said.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"https://www.vanguardngr.com/2018/08/aftermath-of-igbo-traders-exit-criver-commences-coding-of-commercial-vehicle-tricycle-operators/","2":"814","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999923706"},{"0":"NLC backs down on protest in Rivers\nBy Mike Odiegwu, Port Harcourt\nThe Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) has suspended its planned protest in Rivers State following an agreement with the State Government.\nA statement by the Commissioner for Information and Communications, Paulinus Nsirim said officials of NLC led by its National President, Ayuba Wabba, reached the agreement in a meeting at the Government House, Port Harcourt.\nWabba reportedly read the agreement on the implementation of the new national minimum wage and consequential adjustments saying the parties to the dispute agreed to sign it.\nHe said the state NLC secretariat sealed for correction of structural defects would be unsealed while the government continued with the work.\nHe said the State Government would immediately restore the remittance of check-off dues and pay all outstanding arrears to the respective labour unions.\nHe said the government would pay the salaries withheld from health workers due to the 2017 strike action.\nThe NLC President also said the parties agreed to set up a tripartite committee to resolve the adjustment of pensions in line with the constitution and payment of Pension and Gratuity.\nWabba said the parties agreed to take steps to discontinue all ongoing litigations in relation to hitherto disputed matters.\nHe added that no worker would be victimised for their involvement in the industrial dispute with the government.\nHe commended Governor Nyesom Wike for his statesmanship that facilitated the resolution of the dispute.\nThe statement said Dr. Tammy Danagogo, Secretary to the State Government; Rufus Godwins, Head of Service; Paulinus Nsirim, Commissioner for Information and Communications and Dr. Ayebaesin Beredugo signed on behalf of Rivers State Government.\nIt also said that Emmanuel Ugboaja, Gen.

import loss hits N1.4tr\nNigeria records about N1.4 trillion yearly as under-recovery from its importation and sale of Premium Motor Spirit at N145 per litre, Petroleum Resources Minister Ibe Kachikwu said yesterday.\nHe spoke at a meeting in Abuja where stakeholders in the Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) sector met to review the challenges of the LPG market.\nKachikwu explained that it was time Nigeria began to look at alternative fuel sources, such as LPG, which are clean and less expensive.\nHe said President Muhammadu Buhari would in the next two months launch an infrastructure rebirth plan with which the country would leverage to attract private finance to upgrade her oil and gas infrastructure.\nSaid the minister: “Clean energy is very essential and we need to move away from complete utilisation in our transport sector of only PMS which is creating a lot of under-recovery of N1.4 trillion per annum of exposure to the government.\n“At the end of the day, we begin to go into other components of cleaner fuels and rely less on the PMS that is gotten from out of the country.”\nAsked to clarify if the figure on petrol under-recovery was annually and how the government felt about it, Kachikwu replied: “Yes, currently. That is being addressed at a very high level and I don’t want to go into that.”\nIn March, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) disclosed that its expenditure on petrol subsidy was N774 million daily, and that 50 million litres was consumed across the country everyday.\nNNPC’s Group Managing Director Dr. Maikanti Baru described the amount as “under-recovery”, adding that the huge fund was due to the proliferation of filling stations in communities with international land and coastal borders across the country.\nKachikwu also indicated that the government would launch an infrastructure rebirth plan for the oil and gas industry. The rebirth plan he noted, will enable private investors put in money in key infrastructure assets across the entire value chain of the sector.\n“I think government is focused in all the areas. We are hoping to launch an infrastructure rebirth map for the oil sector over the next two months, and I hope His Excellency, the President will launch that.\n“The effect is that it will be to open up tariff and create policy positions that will enable people to actually go in and invest in critical infrastructure that is needed because anywhere you go, whether it is distribution of petroleum products massively through trucks and rather than through pipelines, whether it is being able to take crude into refineries or distribute gas throughout the country, infrastructure is so key.\n“There are lots of stranded gas and power everywhere. Distribution is key; infrastructure is key. We need to find a way of finding enough incentives to enable the private sector go in very bullishly and put the money where it is supposed to be,” he explained.\nOn the significance of the LPG meeting, Kachikwu said: “Coming from this meetings we are having, we will come up with recommendations of what DPR needs to do to deepen licensing issues and enforcement issues, but over and above just going after individuals who have done it wrongly; what are the incentives, schemes and structures we need to put in place, and it just goes to tell u where the storage capacities for the gas we have been buying; where are the official distribution and sales centers?

They are said to have been responsible for the kidnap of the Ejigbo Local Council Development Area boss, Mr Kehinde Bamigbetan, two months ago and a Federal High Court Judge.\nIn the process, seven suspected members of the syndicate were killed during a gun battle, yesterday.\nTwo suspected members of the gang were also arrested at their hideout in Agbara area of Ogun State, while an Indian national identified as Vivex Changrani, said to have been kidnapped Sunday, was rescued.\nRecovered at the end of the gun battle said to have lasted 30 minutes, were four AK 47 riffles, two of which had police identification mark, 28 AK 47 magazines fully loaded, more than 1,000 rounds of AK- 47 live ammunition, army uniforms and two vehicles — a Honda CRV SUV with number plate ABC 106 AE and a Nissan Pathfinder SUV with number plate AGL 730 AZ.\nHow the syndicate was smashed\nBriefing newsmen on how the syndicate met its waterloo, the command’s boss, Mr Umar Manko, said: “Remember when the LCDA chairman was kidnapped, I promised Lagosians we were going to arrest the kidnappers.\n“We got information that these kidnappers were based in Ghana and all efforts to arrest them in Ghana failed because that country had her procedure and they insisted we could not just go there to make any arrest.\n“We went to Ghana with a team of International Policemen, INTERPOL, but after 31 days without a headway, our policemen returned to Nigeria.\n“Based on painstaking follow-up and surveillance in tracking these kidnappers, men of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad discovered their hideout in Agbara two weeks ago.\n“The Commander SARS, Mr Abba Kyari, led a team of crack detectives to a suburb in Agbara where the kidnappers had their camp.\n“After 72 hours of waiting in ambush, the men cordoned off, then stormed the house where all the kidnappers gathered by 3 am, yesterday.”\nThe kidnappers’ modus operandi, as gathered, included dressing in full military uniform, pretending to be military personnel. They would thereafter, kidnap their victims, pretending to be taking them to a military base , only to take them to their hideout, from where they would start negotiating for ransom.\nIn some cases where they usually experience gridlock, some of them would reportedly jump down from their operational vehicle to clear the way, pretending to be conveying a military officer.\nAfter each successful kidnap, they would reportedly share their loot before leaving for Ghana. Preliminary investigation, according to Police sources, revealed that the kidnappers usually give their loot to a Bureau de-change operator after each successful deal who thereafter takes it to them in Ghana.\n$100,000 paid as ransom for Bamigbetan’s release\nIt was gathered that a total of $100,000 was collected by the gang as ransom for the release of the Ejigbo LCDA boss.\nLeader of the syndicate whose identity was given as Jonah Benjamin Osinachi, was said to have collected $50,000 while the other members shared $50,000.\nOne of the suspects who gave his name as Uchenna Nwanyu (25), admitted working for leader of the syndicate.\nAccording to him, “Jonah whom we usually called China (pointing to his boss’ corpse) sent for me from Ghana. I came with his wife and children and lodged in a hotel. I went to his place (Agbara) on Sunday because he said he was expecting his goods. I was there when they were about going for an operation. They all tied charms on their wastes, danced round a liquid substance which they later poured on their heads before leaving the house, wearing their army uniforms with guns.\nThey later came back with a white man whom they pushed inside a room and ordered me to stay with him. They, thereafter, said they would call the man’s relatives the next day (yesterday) for ransom.\nThe rescue operation\n“I was in the room with the man when I heard gunshots. I even helped the man by telling him to lie on the floor so as not to be hit by stray bullets. I later heard footsteps as they all tried to escape. When the gunshots died down, I went out, only to see the policemen. I was even the one that showed them where the kidnapped man was.\n“I knew my boss was a kidnapper but I could not do anything about that because he was the source of my livelihood. I also worked for him in Ghana. I am in charge of his building which is under construction in Ghana and his restaurant.”\nThe second suspect, Ogbonna Emenike, who disclosed that he was only released from prison last Monday over a case of robbery, said he was lured into the gang because of hunger. Although he denied taking part in the abduction, Uchenna said he was one of those who came in with the kidnapped Indian in the early hours of Monday.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"http://www.vanguardngr.com/2013/06/police-kill-7-suspected-abductors-of-lagos-council-boss-nab-2/","2":"1119","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9998893738"},{"0":"APC insists on screening Jonathan, Emefiele, Ngige\nThere was confusion in the All Progressives Congress (APC) yesterday as the National Working Committee (NWC) unfolded plans to screen former President Goodluck Jonathan, Minister of Labour and Employment Dr. Chris Ngige, Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Governor Godwin Emefiele and African Development Bank (AfDB) President Akinwunmi Adesina.\nAlthough the nomination forms were obtained for the four, they never submitted the forms to the party before the close of submission.\nFrontline presidential aspirant, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, Senate President Ahmed Lawan and other 21 contenders will also appear tomorrow before the Presidential Screening Committee.\nThe venue of the exercise is the Conference Hall, Transcorp, Abuja.\nThe seven-man panel set up by the National Working Committee (NWC) is made up of a member from each of the six geo-political zones.\nThe major work of the committee is to scrutinise the nomination documents of the 24 contenders ahead of the primary slated for Saturday.\nOther aspirants expected at the exercise are former Minister of Transportation Rotimi Amaechi, former Minister of Niger Delta Development Senator Godswill Akpabio, former Minister of Science, Technology and Innovation Dr. Ogbonnaya Onu, former Imo State Governor Rochas Okorocha and former Ogun State Governor Ibikunle Amosu.\nRead Also: 2023: Who wins APC’s presidential ticket?\nOthers are Pastor Tunde Bakare, Cross River State Governor Ben Ayade, his Ebonyi State counterpart, Governor Dave Umahi, Ekiti State Governor Kayode Fayemi, Minister of State for Education Emeka Nwajiuba, former Senate President Ken Nnamani, Kogi State Governor Yahaya Bello, Jigawa State Governor Mohammed Badaru Abubakar and former Zamfara State Governor Ahmed Yerima.\nOthers are Senator Ajayi Borroffice, the only female aspirant, Uju Kennedy Ohanenye, Pastor Nicholas Felix Nwagbo, former House of Representatives Speaker Dimeji Bankole, former Minister of Information Chief Ikeobasi Mokelu and Mr Tein Jack Rich.\nAPC National Organising Secretary Sulaiman Arugungu confirmed that the exercise was shifted from today to tomorrow in a telephone interview with our correspondent.\nHe said: “As far as the party is concerned all the 28 aspirants that paid and picked the forms for the nomination as Presidential aspirants, nobody has formally written to us that he has withdrawn his aspiration.\n“All the forms of the 28 aspirants will be taken to the screening committee, not tomorrow (Monday), but on Tuesday, God’s willing, at Transcop Hilton Hotel.”\nArugungu said the panel will be constituted today.\n“But, we have to consult with our leaders before we make it public.

Dr. Bunmi Omoseyindemi and I had led a group from the National Conscience Party, NCP, to join the Afenifere after the radical party we belonged to had taken a decision to boycott the 1999 transition programme without subjecting it to thorough debate. We were received at a rally in Oworonsoki area of Lagos by Leaders of the group such as Chief Ayo Adebanjo and late Alhaji Ganiyu Dawodu.\nChief Ayo Adebanjo had asked Omoseyindemi and I to go purchase nomination forms for the House of Representatives election but we told him we did not want to appear as position seekers and would want to build the party first. He commended our spirit and asked us to meet Alhaji Dawodu to assist him in organisational efforts. That was how we became regulars at his Western House office where we worked round the clock with Mr. Aro Lambo.\nAlhaji Dawodu’s office became a place of voyage for the leading governorship aspirants under the banner of Alliance for Democracy, AD. After interface with them all,we concluded we should support Senator Bola Ahmed Tinubu on account of his role in NADECO abroad. On our first meeting with him at his residence on Sunday Adigun, he introduced us to Rauf Aregbesola who was like the DG of the campaign.\nI recall how I put together the first jingle Tinubu had on TV which I composed from one of the popular songs the struggle field which I had to work with Pat Nebo to record with Tinubu doing some voice over message as :\n“This na the governor we don dey wait o (2ce)\nThis na the governor we don dey wait\nHeeeeee Bola Tinubu(3ce)\nThis na the governor we don dey wait”.\nI do not know if Alhaji Dawodu knew we were Tinubu-leaning as he donated us to the National leadership when panels were being put together to supervise gubernatorial primaries being conducted in December 1998 and we were posted to lead the team to Ondo state.\nWhen we returned from Ondo, Lagos state was already scattered over dispute between the camps of Bola Tinubu and Funsho Williams. The AD Chairman in Lagos, Alhaji Dawodu already submitted the name of Funso Williams to INEC as he won the contest if results of all 20 LGAs were added.\nBut there was a lacuna. The guidelines used for the primaries stipulated that the electoral panel should cancel results anywhere violence takes place. And there were incidents of violence in four LGAs that were strongholds of Funso Williams and if they were cancelled Bola Tinubu was the winner.\nUnfortunately for Williams, Dawodu submitted his name to INEC and disappeared. The Tinubu camp intensified protests and the Leaders of Afenifere looked into the matter.\nTheir decision was that in accordance with the rules they made,Tinubu won the primary if the votes from the troubled areas were removed and directed the Acting Chairman of AD, Chief Ayo Adebanjo to write to INEC and withdraw Funso Williams’ name.\nIt was this adherence to the rule that those who are not aware of what happened then use often to accuse Afenifere of imposing Tinubu on Lagos in 1999. It took six years after before I stumbled on the fact that the crises in those LGAs were contrived to deny Williams victory.\nTinubu won the elections but with a plan from day one to weaken Afenifere so he can replace the collegiate leadership Yoruba are used to with a caliph order in Yoruba politics.\nHis first deft move immediately he became candidate was to be the arrowhead of the group that stopped Chief Bola Ige from picking the AD Presidential flag for the 1999 elections at D’Rovans Hotel. But the moment elections were over, he moved to Ige’s corner when he started his rebellion against Afenifere. His strategy was to start filling the void once the schism in the group became unmanageable. Even when Ige was assassinated,he ensured that the empty coffin that was paraded all over Lagos as his remains was not allowed to stop at the Afenifere Secretariat,a group he was Deputy Leader of till he died.\nI should not forget to mention the fact that the open split in AD was as result of the Dawodu-Tinubu feud in Lagos as it was the parallel congresses held by the two factions in Lagos that led to the AD holding parallel conventions in Abuja in 2000.\nIt was that crisis patch Chief Adesanya was managing in the group till the 2003 elections.The group was able to put some temporary truce in place in all other five states for the elections except in Lagos. It was at the last minute that a deal was offered for Tinubu to return for second term and keep 60% of the remaining elective posts and allow the Dawodu faction fill the remaining 40%. A three – man committee made up of Chief R.Fasoranti, Gen. Alani Akinrinade and my humble self were sent to Lagos to implement the decision.I went to Tinubu before our sitting to persuade him not to disgrace Papa Adesanya around whom there were already loud whispers of indulging Tinubu as he truly loved him even when he disliked some of his ways. Tinubu told me he did not understand Arithmetic and that the proposal was undemocratic. When we eventually met the two factions at the Airport Hotel for a whole day, he came and bluntly refused to implement the decision. I remember this incident a few days back when he called the meeting of the so-called Governor Advisory Council to order a Governor it should be advising to withdraw from the gubernatorial primary of APC in Lagos because Akinwumi Ambode is a captive and not a free Governor like he was when Afeifere handed him the ticket in 1999. I have met Ambode only on three occasions and all in the presence of Tinubu and the indignities he went through all made me pray to God not to be that type of governor in my life. I will narrate them next week.\nTalking of the love Papa Adesanya had for Tinubu, I would just give one instance. Months into Tinubu’s tenure. a scandal broke out around him that he did not attended any of the schools he listed in his resume: from St John’s Primary School, Aroloya in Lagos through Government College, Ibadan and University of Chicago. The scandal broke out shortly after then Speaker of House of Representatives, Salisu Buhari had perjured by submitting a fake certificate from University of Toronto in Canada and was forced to step down. The media was celebrating the scandal and just a sentence from Afenifere against Tinubu then would have done him in.\nI recall vividly being in the office of Senator Adesanya with the late Rev. Tunji Adebiyi when an old man with all grey hair and beards dressed in immaculate white dress with white shoes walked into his office and we had to excuse them. When he left, we went back to meet the Leader and he was in a pensive mood. He told us what the old man told him: “Abraham,you have to disown this boy (Tinubu) now” and that he said to the oldie that “a person who builds a wall does not pull it down.” He said the man got up to leave and said: “You will regret not doing so”.\nThe scene played in my mind in the last inactive days of Senator Adesanya as the last major outing he had before he went down was over Tinubu.\nAfenifere had decided to meet all former AD governors who lost in the 2003 elections and Tinubu who survived the Tsunami largely on account of his close relationship with Atiku.\nWe held meetings with his five former colleagues but Tinubu refused the invitation until January 2, 2004 when Senator Adesanya called me that Senator Ayo Fasanmi had persuaded Tinubu to come for the meeting on the 4th at his Apapa residence. I informed all that were supposed to be at the meeting.\nOn the appointed day, only Senators Adesanya, Fasanmi, Tinubu and I were in Apapa. Tinubu came and Pa Adesanya told him all the grievances against him. He responded to the effect that he accepted Adesanya as his father and Leader but he would not have anything to do with his colleagues again. Papa told him that saying he would not relate with his colleagues amounted to repudiating his leadership.\nAs we rounded off the meeting Sir Olaniwun Ajayi called Pa Adesanya that they were waiting for him at the Afenifere Secretariat for the meeting scheduled with Tinubu. He asked if I did not tell them that the meeting would hold in his house to which he responded that all his colleagues were received at the secretariat. As Papa could not get his driver, he asked me to drive him to Jibowu to meet his colleagues.\nWhen we arrived there, it was the late Chief Wumi Adegbonmire who fired the first salvo that they were sorely disappointed that Papa would indulge Tinubu once again by moving his own meeting to his house and meeting him in their absence.\nSir Olaniwun Ajayi asked me to excuse the meeting at a point with Senator Adesanya telling me to wait for him.I said I knew he had no way of getting home without me.\nWhen they were through with the meeting, I joined him in his office and I saw tears dropped off his eyes as he said to me: “Wo bi Tinubu se so mi di alaimose bayi “(see how Tinubu has turned me to somebody who does not know his left from his right). I drove him back from Jibowu to Apapa and we did not utter a word. He suffered stroke a few days later from which he did not recover till he died. Whenever I reflect on his last days, I always remember the admonition of the Wise Old One:”Disown this boy now or you will regret it”.\n….To be continued .\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"https://www.vanguardngr.com/2018/10/portrait-of-the-tiger-ambode-rode/?fbclid=IwAR3_bIybjruiRn-Bcoe_j9kuACX-g5pObrX2dc_nHY4OsMlmRonetPeyis8","2":"2410","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9998779297"},{"0":"Okorocha joins Imo West Senatorial race\n…endorses deputy for Imo East Senatorial seat\nImo State Governor, Rochas Okorocha, yesterday declared his intention to contest for the Imo West Senatorial seat in 2019.\nThe Imo governor said his participation in the senatorial race will brighten the chances of President Muhammadu Buhari and other candidates of All Progressives Congress ( APC ) in general election in the State.\nOkorocha who made the disclosure during the inauguration of members of Imo State Oil Producing Areas Development Commission (ISOPADEC) at Government House Owerri, also endorsed his deputy, Eze Madumere for Imo East Senatorial seat.\nHe also restated his earlier endorsement of his Chief of Staff and son in-law, Chief Uche Nwosu as his successor.\nAccording to the governor, “if Uche Nwosu will be home for governor, I will tell the deputy governor to go to Senate.\n“I told you earlier that my interest is the Presidency but since President Buhari will be running in 2019 I decided to put my ambition on hold until he completes his tenure.\n“But I have decided to run for the Imo West Senatorial zones because if I don’t, bad people will take the position “.\nOkorocha added further that, “if my name appears on the ballot paper as contesting for Senate, it will boost APC chances in the State.

Thatâ€™s supposed to have been a thing of joy for all of us, but some evil people have made the event into a â€œkill-joy.â€ They smuggled him in at the dead of night (around 2am on Wednesday) and spirited him into a waiting ambulance enroute Aso Rock.\nWhat are we to imagine is happening when our president, who cannot return to the country in broad daylight to waive to us and say â€œthank you, fellow countrymen for your prayers and goodwillâ€, but was stretchered into an ambulance in pitch darkness and driven into a seduced arrear of Aso rock?\nWhy must the Vice President (now Acting President) not be allowed to be present to welcome Mr President at the airport? Who is shielding him away from seeing his â€œrecuperatingâ€ boss, both of whom were jointly elected into governance supposedly byÂ Nigerians? What are we to make of this orchestrated tragic-comic event?\nThe only intelligent conclusion we may draw from how President Yarâ€™Adua was brought back home from Saudi Arabia is that he isnâ€™t any more the same person we used to know!! So, he must be shielded from public view, and even that of his Vice. If that is the case, then I must make bold to say that we have just sprouted a new dilemma that is potentially even more dangerous than what we just survived in getting Jonathan to function as â€œActing presidentâ€, pending the recovery of Yarâ€™Adua.\nOur constitution recognises only a healthy president who function in the open, public view; not one who operates from behind a curtain. So we must constantly have the opportunity of closely monitoring our president to be sure that he is in sound mind and good health to govern. So why is anybody deliberately hiding the president from us if not that he no longer qualifies to be regarded as â€œfit and healthyâ€ to govern? Perhaps, that explains why so much hassle was made of preventing people from seeing him at the airport on Wednesday. The question that requires urgent answer now is, for what purpose has Mr President been brought back in his current condition?\nFrom unfolding events as at the time of writing this piece, it would appear that those who have held the president â€œcaptiveâ€, want to use what is left of him as a pretext to control government, (as intermediaries), and render Jonathan not just ineffective but also subservient to their manipulation. However, their problem, (which is as much our dilemma) is that the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria has no provision whatsoever for any kind of intermediary between an incapacitated president and an acting president! What section 144 of the constitution says is that the incapacitated president should be replaced by his vice.\nThe President isnâ€™t given any option to perform his function through any intermediary.\nThe new dilemma which has sprouted in the orchestrated return of Yarâ€™Adua is that because the presidentâ€™s wife, Turai and her collaborators have prevented all Nigerians, (not excluding the Vice President, as at Thursday, and members of the Federal Executive Council of the country), from seeing the president, we are in no position to assess his state of health.\nWorst still, the presidentâ€™s Saudi doctors have either refused to, or have been instructed not to make available a comprehensive report on the manâ€™s health to the government of Nigeria, thus we are in no position to determine whether Mr President is in a vegetating state, or actually recuperating. It is what these intermediaries tell us that we know, which is hog-wash!!\nWe are now practically between the devil and the deep blue sea. Our options are stark, and only two (as far as I can see). We must find a way of compelling Turai and her collaborators to make Yarâ€™Adua available for professional medical assessment (as provided for by section 144 ofÂ the constitution), or we go the whole hog and terminate this dangerous situation hanging over our heads by startingÂ the process of impeachment to rid the country of a President who might have become â€œunfit to govern.â€\nThat said, one must be human and humane enough to admit that it would be the most unkind way to treat a sick person, who is probably not even aware of this hopeless drama being enacted in his name. From what we have observed and experienced this far, Yarâ€™Adua is helpless, and evil people are taking advantage of his incapacity for their selfish interests. For this reason, impeachment is a very difficult option indeed. It could convulse the nation and distabilize it, which is in nobodyâ€™s interest.\nSo, this brings us right back to section 144 of the constitution. But if Akunyiliâ€™s statement on Wednesday is a measure of the mindset of the Federal Executive Council then it would appear that body is not yet in a hurry to act on section 144. Perhaps it is proper to be cautious at this stage, but when the Acting President talked about waiting for briefing from the ailing presidentâ€™s wife before he could proceed, that by itself is enough reason to worry.\nIf by the time you are reading this piece Acting President Goodluck Jonathan has still not been allowed to see Yarâ€™Adua and report back to Nigerians truthfully on his state of health, then we have a big problem on hand which should make the Federal Executive Council move decisively to activate section 144 of the constitution. They cannot afford to prevaricate at that point.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"https://www.vanguardngr.com/2018/03/dakwambos-presidential-bid/amp/Now","2":"1233","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999923706"},{"0":"The governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) for the Edo State election, Osagie Ize-Iyamu, has faulted Governor Godwin Obaseki on his claim on job creation during Sunday’s governorship debate.\nIze-Iyamu, reacting to a claim by Obaseki that his administration had created 157,000 jobs so far, accused the governor of getting his facts wrong.\n“I am sure he is not going to misplace the appointments he is making now as jobs,” Ize-Iyamu said during the debate in Benin City.\n“I know in the past one month, he has appointed over 2,000 people as SSA s on social media and the rest of them.\n“Those are not jobs.

Fr. Evaristus Bassey said the peoples’ will is sovereign and must be respected, noting that the bill had enormous potent-ial abuses, therefore, it should not become law, because it would be misused against one religion by ambitious state officials.\nFr. Bassey said: “The dang-er in Nigeria is the mani-pulation of structures and institutions by strong ind-ividuals. Thus, the fear is that even if the proposed bill contains good aims, the proposed restrictions would play into the hands of officials of state who have a heg-emonic mentality and would allow them the freedom to persecute one religion in favour of another.\n“The principle of separation of state and Church/Mosque which springs from the supposed secularity of the Nigerian constitution would be severely battered if this bill is pursued in the way it is. Gov. el Rufai, who is quite dogged in the pursuit of anything, given this tool, would pursue ardently both what is good and what may be divisive. We therefore advise that Kaduna State rely on existing laws and existing state instruments of law enforcement, to main-tain religious harmony in the state instead of reinventing the wheel.\n“The majority of Kaduna people appear not to want this law, and their wishes should be respected, as no governor is an emperor but an elected official who should defer to the people’s will. The people’s will is sovereign; because of the potential abuses this bill could bring when it becomes law, we opine that it is not necessary.”\nOn the last National Con-ference, the Catholic Church called on President Muha-mmadu Buhari to revisit the report and institute measures which should stand Nigeria on the pillar of justice and peace, arguing that “Niger-ian citizens should continue to engage political and state structures to become insti-tutions which are guided by the rule of law.\n“Presently, our constitution is like a hermaphrodite, neither completely secular nor religious. A secular con-stitution guarantees the rights and dignity of all under the law,” the Church said.\nIn a similar development, the Catholic Archbishop of Lagos, Most Rev. Alfred Adewale Martins also frowned at the legislation, arguing that the Nigerian Constitution makes pro-vision for freedom of worship.\nSpeaking during a Chrism Mass at the Holy Cross Cathedral, Lagos, Martins stressed that any law that will restrict freedom of worship, should certainly not see the light of the day.\n“I hope the governor will seriously listen to what the people are saying because democracy is about the people and the good of the people. There may be good intentions behind the law but it is important that in making laws for the people, the laws can only be effective and just if the people have an input.”\nCalling on government to take the welfare of Nigerians more seriously by enacting policies that will benefit the general populace, Martins lamented that Nigerians are facing numerous challenges which, according to him, is very worrisome.\n“The government should take the welfare of the people more seriously; there is a lot of suffering, poverty, pro-blems among the people. Government should put in place policies that will indeed help ordinary citizens feel a sense of belonging in the nation,” the archbishop appealed.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"http://www.vanguardngr.com/2016/04/controversial-religious-bill-catholic-church-cautions-el-rufai/","2":"831","3":"Religion","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999866486"},{"0":"By-election results shatter PDP’s return plan, says Presidency\nThe Presidency yesterday said the All Progressives Congress (APC) electoral victories in the three House of Representatives by-elections have shattered assumptions of a Peoples Democratic Party (PDP)’s return to power.\nA statement by Senior Special Assistant on Media and publicity Garba Shehu described the victories in Katsina, Kwara and Bauchi states as signs of things to come in the 2019 elections.\nThe statement reads: “In the by-elections conducted by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) on Saturday, November 17, 2018, the APC swept the seats in three federal constituencies in Katsina State, Kwara State, and Bauchi State.\n“This victory should be a blow for the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) campaigners who have maintained that by merely claiming that they have rebranded, Nigerians will have forgotten all the mess they left behind in 2015.\n“By voting overwhelmingly for the ruling APC, Nigerians have shown their confidence in the Muhammadu Buhari administration, and their willingness for continuation of this government and its policies.\n“This clear show of support can only be a synopsis of what Nigerians should expect in the forthcoming elections, at all levels.\n“I would like to use this opportunity to remind Nigerians that there will always be a winner and a loser in every election, an individual and a party with the highest votes and another with the lowest.\n“That is what democracy is about.

He was full of hope; not just for medals, but also for a hitch-free participation in the games that would be free of controversies.\nThe Paris 2004 Olympics is the minister’s first. Coming from a background, not too conversant with the demands of the sporting sector, he had hoped to start on a clean slate, using his early months as a learning curve. On resumption of office, the Cross River State-born minister told Nigerians that “it is no longer going to be business as usual.” He hardly knew the magnitude of what he was into.\nIf the Senator must know, the story of Nigeria’s participation in the Olympics is one of twists and turns, dotted with pockets of successes and failures. Above all,hardly had there been one Olympic Games in which Team Nigeria would not have one scandal or another, coupled with the administrative ineptitude of officials. This has become a recurring decimal.\nIn the 1980 Moscow Olympics, Team Nigeria was engulfed in a reported sex scandal. A Lagos-based national newspaper published a story which alleged that the country’s delegation was rocked by a sex scandal in Moscow. Although it turned out to be a hoax, that scandal did a lot of damage to the psyche of Nigerian athletes.\nHameed Adio was team Nigeria captain to the Moscow 1980 Olympics held in Russia. He told www.aclsports.com that the story was not true but it had a negative impact on athletes’ concentration, training and mental toughness during the Olympics. Nigeria returned empty-handed.\nFast forward to the Tokyo 2020 Olympics. Team Nigeria was again distracted by so many scandals. The failure of the Athletics Federation of Nigeria to properly guide Nigerian athletes on doping regulations led to the disqualification of ten athletes of Team Nigeria. The athletes were disqualified from competing after they failed to undergo mandatory out-of-competition tests before the global sports fiesta.\nEvents at the Tokyo Games snowballed into the hunting down and subsequent ban on Blessing Okagbare, Divine Oduduru and lately Grace Nwokocha by the the Athletics Integrity Unit (AIU) . Blessing Okagbare was handed a 10-year ban in 2022, while Divine Oduduru got a six-year ban in 2023. Grace Nwokocha was given a three-year ban for using prohibited substances.6 June 2024.\nApart from the failure to properly guide her athletes on doping regulations, the AFN and the Sports Ministry under the leadership of Sunday Dare were locked in a kitting controversy.\nA picture shared by the team after the visit of the Nigerian Ambassador to Japan, Abubakar Moriki, to the team’s camp, showed many of the athletes and officials in different attires, with one of the officials in the picture wearing an Arsenal jersey. Other videos shared by Nigerian athletes in Japan also showed them in different sportswears, like Nike and Adidas.\nThis came to the fore when Nigeria’s shot putter, Chukwuebuka Enekwechi, washed the lone jersey issued to him by the Nigerian officials ahead of his final game at the Olympics.\nThe TikTok video, uploaded by the athlete on his Instagram page, @thechuksay, before he deleted it due to pressure from the Ministry, had the caption: “When you made the Olympic Finals, but you only have one jersey.”\nThis drew a social media rant which described the video as the “latest embarrassment from Team Nigeria Tokyo2020 drama series.”\nThe one jersey per athlete issue was brought about by Sunday Dare’s rejection of the jerseys supplied by PUMA to the Nigerian contingent. The former Minister of Youth and Sports Development insisted that the contingent would not wear the German sportswear kits because of a leadership tussle between the AFN board lead by Ibrahim Gusau and another faction championed by the Minister, Sunday Dare.\nThis crisis came to a head when the German company announced the termination of the four-year deal with the AFN in a letter dated August 4, which was signed by PUMA’s Director Manuel Edlheimb. It was rumoured that Puma would sue Nigeria for breach of contract. Nobody knows what became of that case, four years after.\nWhen Senator Owan Enoh sent forth the Team Nigeria contingent to the ongoing Paris Games, his thoughts were on how well it would end as he believed, like most Nigerians, that Team Nigeria could pull the chestnuts from the fire this time round. The likes of Tobi Amusan, Ese Brume, Favour Ofili, Blessing Oborodudu, Oduayo Adekuroye, the D’Tigress were all seen as very bright medal prospects. No Nigerian boxer had qualified for the boxing event at the Olympics since 2016. This time, three qualified. Unfortunately, one got injured while preparing for the games and he withdrew, the other got beaten in the first fight; while the third, a lady was disqualified for doping offences.\nIn the main, Senator Owan Enoh’s young era has not escaped from tradition. Cynthia Ogunsemilore’s drug failure and subsequent expulsion from Team Nigeria camp and the Olympic village is another scandal bound to leave a huge impact on the Nigerian contingent.\nAs if that is not enough, the mishandling of Favour Oifili’s omission from the 100 mtrs race has raised a lot of questions. The affected athlete cried blue murder as she had trained and conditioned herself to participate in the race having qualified. Ofili won the Nigerian national title in June with a time of 11.06 seconds . Her personal best time of 10.93 may have probably put her in the final of the event at the Olympics. She will, however, be available for the 200 metres 1×400 mtetres relay.\nA senior colleague, Onochie Anibeze believes the exclusion of Ofili from the 100 mtrs dash could have been deliberate by an official. “He could have done that for the good of the athlete,” he reasoned, adding, “she is expected to concentrate on 200 mtr which is her speciality and the relays,” Onochie guessed. Even at that, he was of the opinion that “if it is as I think, the said official should have done that with her consent. She should have been consulted and guided. Not telling her before now makes it bad.” But Anibeze did not also rule out an oversight, a complete error on the side of the officials.\nAfter one week of competition, Nigeria no longer has any stake in boxing, badminton, women’s football among others, swimming, etc. The minister must be realising the cleansing he has to champion in Nigerian sports.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"https://www.vanguardngr.com/2024/08/olympic-games-team-nigerias-bag-of-scandals/","2":"1484","3":"Sports","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999065399"},{"0":"President of the Omega Fire Ministries Worldwide, Apostle Suleman Johnson, has unleashed prayers for the new week amidst the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.\nAllnews reports that as at the time of publishing this report, there had been 111 confirmed coronavirus cases and 1 death in Nigeria. 3 people in the country have recovered after contracting Covid-19 as president of the West African country, Muhammadu Buhari orders lockdown in both Lagos and Abuja.\nAs of 30 March 2020, more than 723,500 cases of COVID-19 have been reported in over 190 countries and territories of the world, resulting in approximately 34,000 deaths.

Rigour has become outdated, noisy charlatanism reigns. Howlers are everywhere. So Kemi Adeosun scampered to safety. She left her case. The accusation of blasphemy by Nigeria’s ‘Almajiris’ , religious or political, is not fought with reasons and arguments. A minister of finance has a duty to be honest and compassionate, and a compelling duty to prevent and stem panic. The proposed emergency economic bill is evidence of direness and government’s appreciation of it. It’s incontrovertible that sufficient urgency and dexterity haven’t been marshaled against our predicament. But it isn’t because Adeosun is ignorant or callous.\nThe ordinary people are prostrate and bleating miserably. And if their hellish and progressively deteriorating circumstances have been rechristened recession then it must be unholy to describe recession as a mere word. The anger of the ordinary people cannot be faulted, servants and messengers should aspire to clarity. But if recession is a statistical classification, then it has no life outside the set of circumstances it labels. Recession describes preexisting state of affairs. Adeosun was neither wrong nor insensitive. She is neither a ‘BarkinZuwo’ nor a Nero . And not a Marie Antoinette.\nBut there are mourners gifted in wailing, feeding on the grief of the ordinary people. They claim cognitive capacities capable of subtle discrimination but revel in intellectual sophistry and verbal thuggery. Their stomachs can’t remember hunger pangs and their thoughts have never been muddled by suffering. Yet, they find room in the pain of millions to make mischief, to foist amnesia on all. They have become self appointed chief mourners. Their naked complicity can’t be atoned by vacuous empathy or sardonic humour. They, who walked the corridors of power with Corruption, and raised not a whimper.\nAdeosun is saddled with a treacherous economy. All the chicken of the prodigal era have come home to roost. The rebasingof GDP and the trophy that came with it was cosmetic nonsense. “The biggest economy in Africa” was a phrase. The naira is bleeding and the economy, rendered chronically anemic by avaricious tapeworms is now in shock. With the currency relentlessly emptying its value,she knows that her lips are being watched. Like a doctor in an emergency room, urgency must be demonstrated but nervousness is counter productive. The line between masterly calmness and perception of lack of empathy is thin. While the economy needs comprehensive policies to rebound,reassurances as cosmetic as they seem, are important.\nSo she says, recession is just a word – do not fret. Because recession, a tag that effectively dropped on us about 2 months ago is not a plague,not damnation, not an imminent Armageddon. The attachment of the epithet does not materially change our pre existing state of the affairs. Power has forever been epileptic,infrastructure has always been neglected, the health system is decrepit . The regularity of workers salaries has been lost since2014. Our foreign reserves were depleted prodigally by the last regime. Unemployment didn’t start today, Abba Moro can attest to that. Millions turned up for his scam.\nWhat exists today despite Reuben Abati and his like, is an effort to stem the bleeding. It may have been poorly coordinated, but it’s not the wanton profligacy of the past. Sophistry is intellectual fraud. Abati insinuates Kemi Adeosun is either out of touch with the pain of the Nigerian masses or with modern economics. So he decides to teach Kemi Adeosun what recession means. He dismisses any figurative reading of Adeosun and points her in the direction of recession. Recession, he postulates, exists in brothels where prostitutes , he reveals, have crashed fees to rescue declining patronage. Satire is good but any public figure conscious of public morality would look for healthy examples. But opportunism rarely countenances moral constraints. So he counts the reduction in prostitution as loss.\nThere is nothing wrong in insisting that this government has contributed to our economic predicament through its tardiness. And criticizing the government is a civic duty. It doe not create navel gazing, ferocious”children of anger”.But with Abati, conjectures become facts very easily. He cites an example of two suicide cases and concludes that suicides rates have been on the increase and rushes headlong to attribute it to recession. Abati wasn’t an editor of a tabloid. How has he become enslaved to sensationalism?\nAnd what happened to the rigour of the Patito’s gang? If after reading Emile Durkheim, Abati thinks that anomie has birthed suicidogenic currents, he may be right. But would he need a soothsayer to tell him that the rampant corruption of the government he promoted left more moral confusion and ethical deregulation than needed to trigger a suicide epidemic? An astronomical rise in suicide rate would be the social complication of spawning a few “nyoungnyoung” billionaires and private jets and leaving the vast majority disillusioned\nOrdinarily, Abati should be ignored. But since he is a prominent partaker in the collective irresponsibility of the past that contributed to the present misery , his lack of contriteness is particularly irritating. Left unchecked the prodigals, unremorseful and unrepentant, will make a re-entry through the window grief and desperation . When you deliberately refrain from speaking out against the Avengers, you must let innocent others, battered by the effects of their economic sabotage, grieve. Mockery must be for those whose acquisitive instincts tucked billions under the beds of their cooks and seamstresses. Abati must take them to the brothels to see the new price lists, to see how the girls now work for nothing.\nWouldn’t you think that an epistle aimed at excoriation would be careful with inconsistencies? Even beer parlour banters are not so totally deficient of coherence. Abati thinks ‘enjoyment joints’ are suffering low patronage like brothels. He could be right. He claims authority . He blames it on recession. But he thinks breweries are still making huge profits. So he needs an ingenuous explanation. Then, he manufactures one. Men, with pockets made lean by recession, go home to drown themselves in liquor and sorrow. Purchasing power has fallen drastically but Ogunpa hasn’t overflowed yet. There is a desperation to paint the picture of apocalypse. And to counter that fraud, you run the risk of irritating the masses who are fed up with excuses and the trading of blames. So the likes of Abati guffaw away, feeling redeemed.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"http://www.vanguardngr.com/2016/09/kemi-adeosun-a-zuwo-or-a-nero/","2":"1484","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999752045"},{"0":"By Emma Amaize & Sam Oyadongha\nTHERE were divergent views, weekend, on the Federal High Court, Lagos order confiscating the property of ex-General Officer Commanding, GOC, Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta, MEND, Government Ekpemupolo, alias Tompolo.\nSome Niger Delta activists, contacted by Sunday Vanguard, declined to speak on the matter, saying Tompolo should have complied with the order to appear before the court, especially after a bench warrant on him was renewed.\nOne of them said: “The court had no option than to seize his property until he decides to appear before it. That is the sum total of the order because as the prosecution indicated, it has to go on with the case without Tompolo.”\nThose who accused the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, of persecuting Tompolo, said “Tompolo Dockyard”, at Enerhen Road, Effurun, and listed as one of his property, belongs to his younger brother, Mr. George Ekpemupolo, currently the Chairman of Warri South –West Local Government Area.\nHowever, the Ijaw Youth Council, Ijaw People Development Initiative, IPDI, Foundation for Human Rights and Anti-Corruption Crusade, FHRAAC, and Niger Delta Security Watch Organization, slammed the Federal Government and the EFCC for the order, which they described as unjustifiable.\nIYC spokesperson, Mr. Eric Omare, said: “The situation is becoming worrisome, especially considering the fact that, from available information, some of the seized property are not Tompolo’s. It follows that the situation is degenerating into persecution of Tompolo and his associates by the EFCC. And, especially, the case is between lawyer Keyamo and Tompolo’s local political enemies”.\nNational President of FHRAAC, Alaowei Cleric Esq., said: “The application purportedly made by the EFCC to seize the property of Tompolo, pending his appearance in court, is nothing but an enforcement of self-rule without recourse to the law.\nIPDI National President, Mr. Austin Ozobo, and President, Niger-Delta Security Watch Organization of Nigeria, Dickson Bekederemo, in a joint statement, said, “The seizure of Tompolo’s assets is unlawful, the order is ill-conceived, barbaric, obnoxious, vindictive and provocative.

In the event however, that refineries (depending on size) have between 18-36 months gestation, this may suggest that subsidy may not be wished away very soon!\nFurthermore, Labour and Civil Societies also recognise that it would be foolhardy to accept deregulation, if the Naira rate continues its steady plunge against the dollar as fuel prices will simultaneously continue to spiral! Conversely, Buhari’s Team may plead that it is not sensible to dedicate over 20% of federal budgets to subsidy and almost 50% of total Crude Export Revenue to consumption of imported fuel annually.\nWe cannot predict the length of the ensuing stalemate, but as usual, in the interest of the nation, government and Labour are likely to once more agree to split the subsidy burden. Clearly, government’s share of subsidy will nonetheless rise if the Naira continues its downward slide or if “fortuitously” or “unfortunately”, crude oil prices rebound once again. For example, if the Naira is left to float as currently proposed by the Banker’s Committee, Naira could well exchange for over N300=$1 before the end of 2015, particularly if the instigation of systemic excess Naira remains an abiding feature of CBN’s monetary strategy.\nInvariably, with such Naira depreciation, fuel prices will spiral about 50% above the price on which subsidy was initially calculated. Consequently, unless pump prices are adjusted upwards, government’s share of the subsidy burden will once again balloon and bring us back to square one, where subsidy exceeds 20% of annual federal budgets.\nFurthermore, in the absence of fiscal discipline, subsidy refunds to marketers will invariably be delayed and will accumulate as usual, until the issue of delayed payments and exchange rate differentials surface once more to trigger fuel scarcity with the attendant painful, social and economic dislocations. Similarly, higher crude prices will also translate to higher fuel prices and increasing subsidy values.\nIn his attempt to end this horrendous cyclical narrative, Buhari will be well advised to recognise that subsidy can be eliminated if crude price remains below $50/barrel, so that ex-refinery cost remains low; ironically, if this happens, our oil revenue base will unfortunately remain depleted and further threaten the Naira exchange rate as is currently the case. Ultimately, increasing speculative dollar demand will instigate further Naira depreciation which would inadvertently pump up fuel price and also swell the existing value of subsidy.\nClearly, if weaker Naira rates instigate higher fuel prices and fuel subsidy values, it stands to reason that an increasingly stronger Naira should also reduce fuel price and ultimately eliminate subsidy while new refineries will be established with the complete deregulation of the sector. For example, if Naira exchanges for N100=$1, this would be a 50% appreciation from the current N200=$1, in this event, the unsubsidized current actual fuel price of about N150/litre will immediately fall below N80/litre, and make N7/litre available as sales tax if the current regulated price of N87/litre remains unchanged.\nNotably, the relative sales tax potential will increase beyond N7/litre if the Naira strengthens below N100=$1. The million-dollar question however, is how the Naira can appreciate when oil revenue is dwindling; after all, as some experts claim, it is the size of our reserves that defines the exchange rate of the Naira! Curiously, in the Nigerian context however, in order for CBN to build up its dollar reserves, it must consciously continue to induce the suffocation of the domestic money market with surplus Naira, despite the adverse attendant economic consequences.\nExpectedly, with such a Naira antagonistic strategy, the Naira exchange rate will be pummeled when it is constantly pitted against the paltry dollar rations, auctioned weekly by CBN from its caché of public sector dollars which were earlier captured and substituted with Naira allocations at an exchange rate that is unilaterally determined by the Apex Bank. This bizarre payments strategy apart from instigating excess Naira, also induces the unforced error of the official provision of presumably ‘scarce’ public sector dollars for the unsubstantiated forex requirements of the black market.\nInstructively, however, if the foreign exchange component of federal allocations are paid with dollar certificates rather than the outright monthly substitution of Naira values which precipitate the constant spectre of surplus Naira and its oppressive train of inflation, huge cost of funds, a weaker Naira as well as higher fuel prices, which make the removal of subsidy impossible.\nIncidentally, the above recommended reform in fiscal allocations, will gradually mop up the unrelenting flood of surplus Naira which swallow the dollar rations sold weekly by CBN; clearly, if this fiscal payment practice is sustained, the Naira may still ultimately exchange below N100=$1 despite reduced crude oil revenue within Buhari’s first year in office.\nThus, Buhari will avoid a protracted social and economic dislocation, if he quickly engages Organised Labour and Civil Societies on a consensus to sustain partial deregulation with government, “reluctantly” conceding 50% of the difference between the current N87/litre and the unsubsidized current actual market price of about N150/litre; with this arrangement, the agreed pump price would be set at N120/litre excluding government’s subsidy of about N33/litre.\nClearly, the implication is that when the Naira ultimately exchanges for N100=$1 because of better managed Naira liquidity, the government could also recoup over N10/litre as sales tax on 40 million litres of fuel consumed daily. Such returns from petrol sales tax will continue to rise as the Naira exchange rate improves with the reform in government’s payments strategy.\nSave the Naira, Save Nigerians!!\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"http://www.vanguardngr.com/2015/05/fuel-subsidy-dilemma-the-sensible-way-out/","2":"1520","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999961853"},{"0":"Residents of Ketu community in Aiyetoro area of Ogun on Sunday expressed mixed feelings over the report that a Pentecostal pastor , Wale Fagbere , was stricken after he allegedly invaded a shrine in the area.\nThey spoke in separate interviews with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Aiyetoro, Yewa North Council Area of the state.\nNAN reports that Fagbere on Sept. 20 allegedly got stricken in a shrine in Ketu community in Ayetoro area of Yewa North Local Government of the state after destroying some structures in the shrine.\nFagbere, who was reported to have been stricken by some angry gods, allegedly regained consciousness after custodians of the shrine carried out some rites on him.\nWhen NAN visited the community on Sunday, many of the traditional title holders declined comments, saying the issue had been resolved.\nSome of the residents of Ayetoro, who spoke with NAN on condition of anonymity, said Fagbere was not telling the truth as he was actually stricken.\nOne of them, a commercial motorcyclist, who said he was at the scene when it happened, confirmed the incident.\n“The pastor got stuck in the shrine and at a point the traditionalists were called in to set him free.\n“ He was there from morning till evening.

Dickson has been dismissed as a shameless arch-sycophant. The Dame has been described as deluded, silly, grasping and ill-qualified. The President has been roundly abused for allowing his wife too much latitude.\nMeanwhile, Mr. Morris Alagoa, who is Chairman of the Bayelsa state chapter of the Civil Liberties Organisation, has made it clear that he regards this development as “unacceptable” for a number of reasons, including his belief that Perm Sec jobs should not be dished out like political appointments or honorary university degrees and should only go to individuals who have steadily worked their way, on a full-time basis and for many years, to the top of the civil service.\nGoing down a dodgy path\nI have said quite a few nice things about The Dame and Dickson in this column in the past. But I have to criticise both of them on this occasion and say that I don’t understand why they have chosen to go down a dodgy path that was bound to lead them into the painful, humiliating realm of mockery and insults.\nTalk about playing into your enemies’ hands! Do Dickson and The Dame honestly, in their hearts, think that she deserves a slot that normally goes to dedicated senior career bureaucrats? Did they not realise that they would expose themselves to negative comments such as the following observation, which was attributed to writer Kaanayo Nwachukwu on an internet site I recently visited:\n“Even the wives of Idi Amin, Eyadema, Omar Bongo, Mugabe, Charles Taylor, Jammeh, Mbasogo, Kerekou, Gbagbo, Ben-Ali, Mubarak, Ghaddafi, Olusegun Obasanjo, Abacha, Babangida, Rawlings, Dos Santos, Idris Deby, Paul Biya, Zenawi, Afewarki, Mobutu, Kabila, Bokassa…who have ruled and ruined Africa – and continue to rule and ruin – are not half as ambitious as Patience Jonathan”.\nBut I am more interested in the personal angle than the ethical, legal and procedural aspects. So while most of Dickson and The Dame’s detractors are focusing on issues such as her eligibility for the post and his motives for offering it to her, the questions that keep reverberating through my mind are:\nWhy bother about a Perm Sec title\nWhy is The Dame bothering with a Perm Sec title in the midst of all this damaging controversy when the title she already has – Her Excellency, First Lady Of The Federal Republic Of Nigeria – puts her at the pinnacle of our society? Is the Perm Sec thing not a demotion rather than a promotion?!\nWhether we like it or not, First Ladies in ANY country have more status than females who have been high achievers in their own rights…and have performed impressively as businesswomen, lawyers, doctors, journalists or whatever.\nDo people queue up to meet Michelle Obama or Samantha Cameron because they are mega-talented professionals or because they happen to be the consorts of the President of the United States and the Prime Minister of Great Britain?\nGrace Kelly, a dazzlingly beautiful 1950s movie star, attracted tons of fawning adulation in her heyday. But there are different levels of adulation; and it was not until she got hitched to Prince Ranier, the ruler of Monaco, that people started to courtsey in her presence and address her as “Your Serene Highness”.\nWhen The Dame embarks on countrywide tours, do Perm Secs in various states not line up to almost kiss her feet? So why did she accept membership of a group that is compelled by convention to treat her like a revered superior?\nBeing respected because of who you married is probably not as satisfying as being respected for what you have actually done. And The Dame can get the best of both worlds if she GENUINELY commits herself to worthy causes.\nWORDS like “bush” and “nincompoop” are routinely and contemptuously bandied around whenever the current administration is being discussed nowadays; and a lot of Yorubas, Fulanis, Middle Belters and Igbos have, in recent months, a) bitterly berated me for hassling them to vote for my “Big Brother” Goodluck Jonathan and b) assured me that they will never EVER vote for a Niger Deltan Presidential candidate again because they regard Jonathan a huge flop.\nI find this attitude immensely offensive and ridiculously tribalistic.\nSince I myself am deeply disappointed in President Jonathan, I cannot blame anyone who shares my view that his leadership style is flawed. But I don’t see why every single Niger Deltan politician should be tarred with the same brush!\nWhy should an acknowledgement of one person’s weaknesses expand to the point where you blindly despise the entire population of an entire region? I don’t remember any of the folks who are complaining about Jonathan saying that we should never again tolerate a Northern or South-Western president because of the multiple shortcomings of Shagari, IBB, Yar’Adua, Abacha and Obasanjo!,\nI’m yearning for Jonathan to shine and am so very sorry that he hasn’t done well enough. But Niger Deltans are as entitled to be ineffective or disastrous as indigenes of other geopolitical zones! And, for the record, there are plenty of Niger Deltan men and women who will do better if they are given a chance.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"http://www.vanguardngr.com/2013/11/time-line-ASUU-strike/Why","2":"1270","3":"Education","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999885559"},{"0":"Detained Adeleke to be arraigned in Abuja today\nTHE Osun State candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in last year’s governorship election, Senator Ademola Adeleke, will be arraigned today in Abuja, the police said last night.\nAccording to Force spokesman Frank Mba, a Deputy Superintendent of Police (DCP), the senator was arrested and being detained in connection with ongoing criminal investigations touching on his person.\nHe, however, declined to give the exact charges against Adeleke.

That doesn’t seem right. So, what does the Christian say to that?\nFirst of all, what people consider fair is not what God considers to be fair. The Bible tells us that God is holy (1 Peter 1:16), and holiness requires nothing less than self. Also, all people have sinned (Romans 3:23) and sin results in the judgment of God (Isaiah 59:2; Romans 6:23). Therefore, the person who lived a good life is still a sinner. Obviously, a “good person” has not sinned as much as a person who purposely rebelled against God his whole life. But it is not the amount of sin that is the issue. Rather, it is sin itself. Any sin is sufficient to bring damnation.\nSecond, the sacrifice of Jesus (who was God in flesh, John 1:1,14; Colossians 2:9) is of such tremendous value that it can clean the sins of someone who committed only a little sin as well as someone who sinned a great deal.\nSo, is it fair that a person who was bad his whole life gets to go to heaven because he accepts Jesus, but a good person who doesn’t receive Jesus goes to hell? Yes, it is fair. Whether someone has sinned a great deal or a little or receives Christ early in life or late in life, salvation is guaranteed to those who truly receive Christ as their Savior… all of their sins are removed. Without the cleansing sacrifice of Christ on the cross (which is received by faith), nobody will be able to stand before the infinitely holy presence of God, no matter how good they were on earth.","1":"http://ow.ly/COkm50LtZ9t","2":"419","3":"Religion","4":"2","5":"en","6":"0.9999961853"},{"0":"BY KENNETH EHIGIATOR\nThe Federal Government, weekend, confirmed that Ethiopian Airlines would commence direct flights to and from Akanu Ibiam International Airport, Enugu, from Saturday, August 24, 2013.\nThis would be the first international flights to be operated into the South East geo-political zone of the country, barely two years after the airport in Enugu was accorded international status.\nMinister of Aviation, Princess Stella Oduah, who disclosed this in Abuja, said she had already written President Goodluck Jonathan informing him of the airlines’ inaugural flight.\nShe said the airport’s designation as an international airport was part of the aviation master plan of the present administration to give every zone in the country the opportunity to grow its full potentials in economic and social development.\nWith the foray of Ethiopian Airlines into Enugu, businessmen and other travellers from all the states of the South East as well as Edo and Delta now have the option of making their international travels through Enugu, rather than erstwhile reliance of far-aay Lagos and Abuja.\nGeneral Manager, Corporate Communication, Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria, FAAN, Yakubu Dati, said President Jonathan’s administration had fulfilled his promise of giving every part of the country equal opportunity to develop and realise its dreams.\nAccording to him, the Akanu Ibiam International Airport, Enugu, was designed and built by the former Vice President, Dr Alex Ekwueme when he was only 26, while his vision of many years is now being fulfilled.\nHe said: “This Minister of Aviation has shown her determination to actualise the goals of the aviation master plan which the Jonathan administration has pegged its transformation agenda which objectives include giving every part of the country and every citizen the opportunity to grow to his full potential.\n“With the international flight operations at the Akanu Ibiam International Airport, a novel opportunity has been given to the people of the South East zone to expand their business horizon without stress and the inconveniences of having to travel far to catch international flights.”\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"http://www.vanguardngr.com/2013/08/ethiopia-airlines-begins-international-flights-from-enugu-airport/","2":"450","3":"Travel","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9998607635"},{"0":"Compiled by Florence Amagiya\nI was watching a program on T.V just the other day when a Governor of one of the South South states came on air and advertised his\nachievements as Governor.

Agbakoba co-founded the Civil Liberty Organisation, CLO, in Nigeria and founded Human Rights Law Services. In this interview, he spoke on the state of the nation, communication importance in government, President Muhammadu Buhari’s economy policies and others.\nWe have seen at least 195 days of General Muhammadu Buhari as President of Nigeria, what is your view on the state of the nation?\nWell, it is good when you listen to perception; know what people think because action of government is to reflect what people want. When I was NBA President, I always do what I call sweeping. I will make sweeping calls to about 10 Chair persons to know what lawyers are thinking.\nPerception is very important. It is for the President to pay more attention to the way people feel and that is why we need a communication strategy, such as having a Director of Communication. You find different people say different things about the President.\nSome say that he does not know what he is doing and some say he is too slow. But my interest in the President is not as General Buhari as a president because I have not met him, I do not know what he does. The country is suffering what I call economic anaemia. There is no money in the system because a lot of parameters are not working. There is no investment law, competition law, which is why MTN can do what it likes.\nDoes this suggest that in 2016, communication should be one of the key things for effecting the change President Buhari intends to deliver to Nigerians?\nI hope that the present administration will understand that in 2016, communicating their strategy should be of prime importance so as to dispel all doubts. Also, the Biafra thing is what a good communication strategist will communicate. I think this administration has not done well in communication. In abroad, what attracts people is the programme. If I look at your programme and I am able to compare, then I can make my choice.\nIf you look at the Presidential Debate in the US, you will be able to make your choice. But in Nigerian politics, it is a personal thing. You will need to know the person and touch him. In the US, for example, you do not need to know anybody; he will appeal to you by what he does. So President Buhari’s programme, quite surprisingly, appears to me as something to be looked at.\nWhich means that President Buhari’s programme would succeed since people like you are impressed by it?\nI am keen to see that it succeeds. Everybody wants to have a break. If he (President Buhari) is going to take us there, then we will support it. I am tired of being able to handle money but unable to spend it because one is not happy. You need to have a country where you feel safe.\nYou know I come from Apapa in Lagos and you know what happens there? You think I like it that I have towalk one mile to the office, in a place that is Nigeria’s richest community? We need to have a good country. And like I said earlier on, the President need to pay more attention to the way people feel and that is why we need this communication strategy.\nBut some people have misconceived you, saying there is something you are looking for from this administration?\nFor those who know me for a long time, they know that I do not need to look for anything. I had a chance to be Abacha’s Attorney-General at age 34 or 35, that was quite tempting and not what I was looking for. I am just looking for a good Nigeria.\nMany Nigerians seem not to understand President Buhari’s economic policies. Looking at your good sense of economy, can you share what you know about it?\nThe nature of person’s ideology changes with where he is. So the natures of what countries do depend on where they are at any time. Basically, Nigeria as an emerging economy is a very poor country, typified by the fact that we are in the primmest land yet I have no water. Anyone who wants to design a programme for a poor country will take into account what the people want and what their need is. There is no template.\nA group better known as the Washington Consensus came together and felt that in the context of the war between the west and east, that imposing democracy and imposing the western economy thought will keep the sovereignty away. If you understand it and do not believe it, that is too bad. But for us who are international political economist, I know that the biggest challenge we face is the west and the east, the conflict that they have had and how it has affected us.\nSo the first thing they will do is to bring their doctors of economy and say structural adjustment programme, which we resisted in Gani’s house in 1985 when IBB started it. We said it cannot work in a poor country. You cannot be doing structural adjustment programme when people are hungry. It may be good in the west, but here, it is difficult because people are poor. So if we agree that people are poor, then the last thing you will want to do is to inflict further harm on the people.\nBut I think I understand what President Buhari’s economic policy is, it has two components. It is a derivative of social regulation. Underpinning the programme, as I understood, it is social regulation, which makes provision for people who are at the bottom and trying to bring them up and at the same time leaving space for market efficiency so that the markets can run.\nSocial regulation means we cater for those who need government support but we will allow the Dangotes and the Otedolas space to work, then we task them to about 30 percent to 40 percent, which will be well collected. Once that is done, the money would drizzle down to assist the social regulation policy. It is a mixed economy model that I think it is what this administration want to present.\nThose who feel like doing business in the country will find that they have the space but they are not going to do it like they have in America. Even in America, there have been questions on the republican model of running an economy.\nWhat programme do you think would thrive in Nigeria today, considering the poverty rate you just mentioned?\nIf you have a programme, the one that is commonly referred to as market feudalism, which means asking everybody to go and the best person to sell wheat flour wins. Then you will find out that the person can drive his price up, in the exclusion of others, and make money. So market feudalism, which was Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala’s doctrine, failed because in the years you will see that her policies did not work.\nThe other one is social democracy and you will find it in Denmark, Norway and other countries. That is why they are the richest countries in the world, even if they have small population. They do social democracy where they plan for everybody. They know the need of everybody and try to meet it. I think social democracy is a better programme for Nigeria than market feudalism. Now, I go back to the challenge of not communicating effectively.\nIn your recent letter to President Buhari, you talked about conspiracy of the elite, can you expatiate?\nThe problem Obama is facing in America is that of the conspirators. Do you know that he was so frustrated in the last 3 killings and he said he was tired of sitting and being helpless as the America President whereas the gun lobby will not allow him to control guns? Who is benefitting? The last person that killed had 13 guns in the house. How can that be? Why is America unable to raid the gun supply? It is simply because people are making billions.\nWhat are your thoughts on sovereign wealth fund vis-a-vis your advocacy for freeing frozen funds; there are huge funds frozen while infrastructure in the country is in terrible state?\nSovereign wealth fund is a small issue in the large equation. When I was the NBA President, I was able to invite one of the world’s leading thinkers of waking dead capital. Some of my friends, when they come to Nigeria, evaluating it to its state of wealth economy wise, they are shock that amidst great wealth there is poverty. Now development law, which we preach but it has not been understood by anybody, government does not have a lawyer in the policy space.\nThis world is a large space and only the best will thrive. It is shocking that as the developed world and China go about setting standards and goals for investment and trade, there is no single investment and trade lawyer who has any expertise to criss-cross various multi-lateral conferences that take place, fixing your own fortune.\nFor instance, in the last Doha, World Trade Organization (WTO) became stranded by the objection of Brazil and India on the utilization of tree-bags which we allow the west to take away and make into quinine, and then they now put intellectual imprimatur on it- your products. They take it away and reset it. The worst one was when they move into higher drugs, which they wanted to bring to South Africa and India to sell at a high rate.\nSo what am I saying? I am saying that Nigeria is not taking advantage of its huge soft institutions of experts, particularly law. My simple theory is that we have enough money in Nigeria not to worry about how to build our roads. But all our banks, until the Soludo resolution, were interested in getting public fund and lending. So they would not give you any money because they will get it from the government and that was enough to make huge profit.\nWhat is your perception of the various election tribunal judgements across the country, especially the judgement of the Taraba Governorship Tribunal?\nThese people who go to court have absolutely lost their senses. The reason why they are so mad is to access the money that is available in government house. Is it not the Taraba man that flew a jet and broke his leg? I am discussing the foolishness of the elite. We need to make this type of Taraba example obsolete. It should not be discussed. We need to make the quest for power to be only for those who want it.\nMy view is that if you give N1 million as allowance in the national assembly many will go and not return. We need to understand that the elites and elite’s structure are the ones who propose people to the tribunal. Of course, they pay lawyers to do the cases. I am tired of unravelling the conflicting decisions. You look at Taraba, you look at Kogi and somebody told me that they will end in absolute mess.\nHave you seen any election that is different? It is the same complain that INEC did not bring materials on time or they did not provide enough material. Until we help Nigerians understand that they need to take up arms and begin to exercise their right, Nigeria is not going to change.\nIn your letter to President Buhari, you noted that many Nigerians feel alienated and disconnected. Don’t you think that is the reason for recent Biafra struggle?\nThe Biafra thing is not an agitation. People there are very hungry, I am from there. They have been dispossessed and abandoned by different political leaders who deceive them when they come for their votes. APC, PDP and APGA- all kinds of parties deceive them and led them to exactly where they are. The last time I was at the area, I was shocked when I drove around. I was shocked at the level of poverty and unemployment.\nSo when somebody who is an elite wants to manipulate them, which is what is going on now, they will fall for it. I I think the best case has been explained by Prof. Wole Soyinka. We should not say that this country is indivisible. There is nothing indivisible about Nigeria. If we cannot live together, let us go in pieces. Who is to say that it is indivisible and treason? It is not.\nIf you were President Buhari, how would you handle the Biafra issue?\nIf I were President Buhari, I will first find out what the people are agitating. When I know the problem, then I will know how to deal with it and move on. The Nigeria configuration, the Nigeria country, needs to be panel beated around again so that everybody can feel happy.\nYou will need to assign space and a room in a country called Nigeria. But right now, 180 million Nigerians are outside, they have no room and they can see a few Nigerians eating very well inside a room. So they wonder if it is not their own meal too. The more they eat, the more these men get angry.\nThe wall separating the two is so huge and the elite keep constructing it and they have reached a position where they just ignore the people and do not care about what the people say. They do what they like and say to hell with you because you will collect their money and vote for them. This is the time to deal with the elite.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"http://www.vanguardngr.com/2015/12/theres-nothing-indivisible-about-nigeria-agbakoba/","2":"2813","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999961853"},{"0":"Billionaire philanthropist Mo Ibrahim on Monday hit out at the Nigerian federal government for a crackdown on unarmed civilians during #EndSARS protest, a protest that spilt over into wider calls for better governance.\nHuman rights monitor Amnesty International has said security forces shot and killed 12 people during the protest in Lagos, on October 20.\nBut the military last week denied shooting live rounds, insisting that soldiers only fired blanks at the crowds who had gathered in defiance of a curfew.\n“I really don’t understand why the government needed to attack peaceful demonstrators,” Ibrahim, a Sudanese-British businessman who made his fortune in telecoms, told AFP.\n“This is what bothers me, this closing of space, of civil society. The right of people to stand up and say their views is a sacred right, and that was totally unacceptable.”\nIbrahim was speaking after his foundation suggested that governance progress had slowed across Africa for the first time in a decade, even before the coronavirus pandemic hit.\nIn particular, the report by the Mo Ibrahim Index of African Governance, published every two years, found that the commitment to democracy and civil rights had faltered.\n– Progress slowing –\nThe index scores each African government on criteria including anti-corruption measures, protection of civil liberties and caring for the environment.\nMore than 60 per cent of Africans live in countries that made progress in good governance between 2010 and 2019, this year’s report said.\nBut progress slowed in the last five years and this year, for the first time in the last 10 years, the combined score for all the countries fell year-on-year.\nThe foundation, set up in 2006 to focus on the need for good political leadership and public governance in Africa, cited growing curbs on people’s ability to exercise their democratic rights and take part in civil society.\nThe results use data from last year and do not therefore include the impact of the coronavirus.\nSince the pandemic began, some elections have been postponed, the report said. But “the continent had been going through a deterioration of civil society space, participation and rights long before Covid-19”.\nThere is “an increasingly precarious environment for human rights and civic participation” as well as a “deteriorating security situation,” it added.\n– ‘Worrying declines’ –\nIbrahim told AFP that Nigeria’s authorities had deliberately conflated peaceful protests with looters, instead of seeing them as two separate events.\nCivilians had the right to speak out and the government needed to listen, he added, noting that Africa’s better-connected young were increasingly questioning their ageing leaders.\nElsewhere in Africa, there has been deadly unrest in Guinea and Ivory Coast sparked by constitutional changes pushed through by incumbent presidents to enable them to stay in power.\nPost-election clashes have claimed scores of lives in Ivory Coast and at least 21 in Guinea, where several opposition figures are in police custody over the violence.\nThe UN last week called for urgent measures to protect civilians in Mozambique’s northeastern Cabo Delgado province, where jihadists are wreaking havoc.\nSince 2015, countries’ scores for security and rule of law and participation have slowly worsened while scores for rights and inclusion have fallen more sharply, the report said.\nSouth Africa, ranked sixth, has declined over the decade, falling more steeply since 2015, and is on a “concerning trajectory”, the report found.\nThe country’s former president, Jacob Zuma, was forced out by the ruling African National Congress (ANC) over a slew of corruption scandals.\n– Covid inequality –\nOnly one country, Ethiopia, has made progress across all areas measured over a decade, the report said.\nBut the nation is now embroiled in a military conflict pitting the federal government against the dissident northern region of Tigray.\n“Definitely people need dialogue, national dialogue,” Ibrahim told AFP, referring to the situation there.\nMeanwhile, coronavirus now threatens gains in economic opportunity across the continent, he added.\n“Covid has exposed inequality like no other factor before… If you are well off, it’s different.\n“If you’re a manual worker earning a living day by day, living in a small apartment with three kids and you’re being locked up with no support from the government, it’s hell.”\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"https://www.vanguardngr.com/2020/11/totally-unacceptable-mo-ibrahim-condemns-crackdown-on-endsars-protesters/amp","2":"959","3":"Politics","4":"2","5":"en","6":"0.9999485016"},{"0":"Morocco's Atlas Lions have not exactly lived up to what many expected from them being that the seemed to be Africa's strongest representative going into the Russia 2018 World Cup.\nMorocco looked strong going to Russia\nAnyone observing the Moroccan national team during the 2018 World Cup qualifiers last year would have said they were Africa's strongest side going to Russia and possibly the strongest Moroccan side ever.\nAside from going through the toughest final stage of the African qualifiers with the unique honor of not conceding a single goal, they achieved two exceptional results even the other strongest African teams will envy; beating the Malian side by a whopping six goals to nil and beating the highly rated Ivory Coast by a two nil margin on their home soil.\nThe unforgettable 1986 experience\nMany Moroccan and even African soccer fans were probably looking forward to a performance that will surpass that of Aziz Bouderbala and co in Mexico in1986. It has not been that in Russia.\nIn that unforgettable performance in 1986, Morocco became the first African side to go past the group stage in a world cup tournament, creating the belief for African teams that Cameroon, Nigeria, Senegal, Ghana and Algeria have since built upon.\nAtlas Lions' losses in Russia\nAt Russia 2018, however, the exotically named Atlas Lions have exited having lost 2 group matches and achieved a draw with Spain, but it is the first result that was quite disturbing. If Morocco had a good chance of qualifying from their group, it could surely only have happened by their seizing the opportunity to beat Iran, the other less rated side therein.\nWhy has the Moroccan team in Russia failed to measure up to expectation?\nIn truth, their lack of consistency in attack during the qualifiers was not entirely invisible given that they scored quite impressively but in only 3 of 6 of their final group qualifiers.\nNeglecting their home based players\nA better performance in Russia may have come the Lions' way if they had built their world cup squad around the home based side that won the African Nations Championship on home soil earlier this year. That squad scored 16 goals in 6 matches en route their victory, scoring at least 2 goals in each of their important matches and defeating their fellow African giants Nigeria by a spectacular four goals to nil in the final.\nA little more belief in this home based squad may have seen the Atlas Lions add a strong offensive bite to their disciplined defense, and Morocco might have contended well for a second round ticket in Russia. As it stands, they will be leaving Russia with just a point which means they take last place in their group. Not a good standing for an African giant.\nHome based players are a necessary world cup risk\nThis is a lesson African footballing nations should learn from. Home based players are a necessary world cup risk!\nIn any African world cup team, the foreign professionals are surely not to be done away with, but there must be a balance. Competition for places in the national team should be as tough for foreign pros as it is for domestic league players. Ideally the balance in any African team going to the world cup should be 12 domestic league players and 11 foreign based professionals.\nThe problem with Africa's foreign professional soccer legion is that they lack the hunger of the home based players. They earn quite well by African standards and are prone to at least slightly excessive injury avoidance in order to protect their mostly European club soccer careers. No African world cup squad should be made up entirely of such players.\nEuropean clubs will surely have their radars also on players who have only played in Africa but manage to outplay top European and South American players at the world cup. Africa's home based players would be aware of this by now and they should not be denied the chance to exploit it!

He told them that Oshiomhole is in charge of the party. Buhari even told Rochas to drop his senatorial ambition and allow Hope Uzodinma to go to the Senate.\n“But Rochas disagreed. Amosun was also given an option that could resolve the crises, but he refused like his co-traveler, Rochas. Their actions got the President infuriated. They had thought that Buhari would support an illegality.\nThey became frustrated, especially when their fellow governors told said they were not interested in the anti-Oshiomhole meeting. Governor Elrufai told them not to call him on phone again for such, stating that it was wrong to use other people in settling personal scores.\nEven Governor Bello said he would not join them on the grounds that he stands with the President on any issue. Okorocha came to Abuja three days before the failed meeting in his attempt to mobilise support.\nA vote of confidence\n“They are now moblising NWC members. They have started collecting their names but it is dead on arrival because they only have one person, who they think is loyal to them. They are collecting the names of those they think are against Comrade. Our party’s Deputy National Chairman, North, Sen Lawali Shuaibu is with them. He is a mole in our party. We have long discovered that he has sympathy for Saraki. We will defeat them.\nThey even want to use the state chairmen but unknown to them, the state chairmen are loyal to Oshiomhole. All the state chairmen in the South-South have passed a vote of confidence in him. That puts him in a better position. The Minister of Transport, Rotimi Amaechi even held a meeting yesterday (Thursday) where he cautioned party chieftains against moving Oshiomhole.\nOkorocha, Amosun, Yari, and Akeredolu\n“Rochas has budgeted so much for this project. That is why he is leading the offensive. Another meeting has even been scheduled for Tuesday. The agenda is their intention to remove Oshiomhole for refusing the subversion of popular wishes in their respective states. Okorocha, Amosun, Yari and even Akeredolu are just being motivated by selfish interest. Okorocha is hell-bent on installing his son-in-law, Uche Nwosu, while a man, who is engaged to his daughter, would become Nwosu’s running mate.\n“He would also be in the Senate at the same time. That is not acceptable to Mr. President and our party chairman. Okorocha is exhibiting the height of greed because he had come several times to seek Oshiomhole’s support.\nThe position of Oshiomhole is that the matter belongs to the people of the state. Oshiomhole has no grouse against Okorocha, who he returned the party structure to after being humiliated by the John Oyegun-led defunct national leadership.\n“At a meeting that was held for the aggrieved people in Imo, Oshiomhole asked Okorocha to take 55 percent of the positions, while Sen Hope Uzodima and Sen Uwajumogu group takes 45 percent, but Rochas refused, saying that Uzodinma and his group are not members of the party. Rochas wants to take Uzodinma’s seat in the Senate, while he has got someone to replace Uwajumogu in his senatorial district. These senators are the people fight for President Buhari in the Southeast and Rochas wants to displace them.\n“There is a security report that APC would lose Imo State if the ticket is given to Okorocha’s son-in-law.

Saraki and a host of senators were said to be meeting in Abuja, last night over the issue. Details of the strategic meeting were not available at press time.\nAlso, members of Senate Unity Forum, SUF, an anti-Saraki group in the Senate were, yesterday, engaged in a marathon meeting. It was gathered that the senators who met in Abuja in an undisclosed venue, were said to have gathered to strategize ahead of the resumption of the Senate.\nAccording to a source, the meeting was a follow up to the one held by senators loyal to Saraki, weekend.\nLeave Buhari out of Saraki’s trial-Presidency\nWhile saying that it will not tolerate claims linking President Buhari to the matter, the presidency added that the speculation that CCB and CCT only act on external influence was unfounded.\nA statement by the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Mallam Garba Shehu said: “There is no place in law that the Bureau and the tribunal should take instructions from any quarters.”\nAccording to him, “as an independent institution equal to any superior court of record, the tribunal is set up by the constitution to determine the issue of default, false declaration or forgery in assets declaration.”\nShehu said that the matter was purely a judicial process and had nothing to do with the presidency. He advised the affected parties to also use the courts to acquit themselves of the allegations.\nAccording to Shehu, the president cannot interfere with the judicial process by stopping the Judge. He reiterated President Buhari’s avowed commitment to the fight against corruption no matter whose ox is gored, saying that the President has sworn to protect the constitution.\n“If anyone has an axe to grind with what they are doing, they should do it in a judicial manner by challenging those actions in a proper court of law. Let them hire a good team of lawyers to prove their innocence.\n“Government has no desire to persecute anybody. The President has vowed to respect the rule of law and this is what he is doing by staying out of this matter. He has said times without number that the war against corruption has no sacred cows. Even if the President wants to help, there is no way he can do anything. Is he going to ask the judge to stop the trial?\n“It is purely a judicial process, the type of which are routinely dealt with by the CCB and the CCT. There are many cases like this that are going on. The President has sworn to an oath to protect the constitution and will not violate that oath”, Shehu said.\nThree-fold legal fisticuffs\nOne leg of the triangular legal battles will be at the CCT, where Justice Danladi Umar will be expecting the Inspector General of Police, Mr. Solomon Arase and other security agencies to produce Saraki for arraignment. Saraki refused to appear before the CCT on Friday and sent his team of lawyers led by former President of the Nigeria Bar Association (NBA), Mr. J.B Daudu (SAN) to file a memorandum of conditional appearance on his behalf. Justice Umar in issuing a bench warrant said that having sworn to protect the constitution Saraki should have shown respect to the tribunal and appeared.\nThe second leg will be at the Federal High Court Abuja, where Justice Ahmed Mohammed is also expecting the Ministry of Justice, the chairmen of the CCT (Justice Umar) and the CCB, Mr. Sam Saba over the charge against Saraki. Justice Mohammed had on Thursday summoned the trio to appear before him today after hearing Dr. Saraki’s ex-parte application.\nAnd the third front is at the Court of Appeal where Saraki has gone to challenge the powers of the CCT to try him as well as the refusal of the tribunal to discharge the bench warrant for his arrest, adding that the CCT acted without jurisdiction by assuming jurisdiction over a charge that is being challenged at the Federal High Court.\nSaraki returns to Abuja\nMeanwhile, Saraki’s Spokesman, Mr Yusuph Olaniyonu, yesterday, dismissed as false, reports that Saraki was hiding. He said in a telephone chat: “No. we are just arriving Abuja from Ilorin. Why will he leave Nigeria? For what? We are in Abuja. At least you know where he lives, you can come and have dinner with him.”\nAsked if the Senate President will appear before the CCT, he said: “I can’t answer that question. It is a legal matter, only his lawyer will answer but you know there are three angles to the matter. You have the Federal High Court, CCT and Court of Appeal.”\nSaraki may appear before high court\nA source close to the Senate President who spoke to Vanguard on grounds of anonymity, yesterday, stressed that Saraki would not be comfortable to appear before the CCT today, “having regards to the hurried way the Justice Danladi Umar-led panel issued a bench warrant against him on Friday based on a mere oral application”.\nHowever, the source, who is part of Saraki’s legal team, but not authorised to speak on his behalf, said his client would rather prefer to appear before Justice Ahmed Mohammed of the Federal High Court in Abuja who is presiding over the suit seeking to halt the proceeding of the CCT.\nJustice Mohammed had on Thursday adjourned till today to hear Saraki’s suit against both the tribunal, the CCB, the Ministry of Justice and the deputy director in the office of the Attorney General of the Federation, Mr. M.S. Hassan, who signed the charge against the Senate President.\n“You will recall that whereas the CCT commenced its sitting on Friday, the same day it hurriedly issued a bench warrant against the Senate President, Justice Mohammed of the Federal High Court had earlier on Thursday delivered a ruling that ought to have put the proceeding of the CCT in abeyance.\n“Justice Mohammed was categorical when he summoned the Chairmen of both the CCT and the Code of Conduct Bureau to appear before him today to show cause. When you are asked to come and show cause, it means that you should come and adduce reasons why you should be allowed to proceed with a planned action.\n“The record before the Federal High Court which is a superior court to the CCT shows that the subject matter of the ex-parte motion marked FHC/ABJ/CS/775/15, bothers on the legal propriety of the proceeding before the tribunal.\n“If a court of competent jurisdiction had asked you to come and show cause why you should be allowed to do a specific thing, and you are notified about the ruling of the court, yet you go ahead to do exactly the same thing the plaintiff is trying to prevent, does that not in itself epitomise lack of respect for a constituted authority?”\nMeantime, effort to reach Saraki’s lead counsel, Mr. Daudu, SAN, yesterday, proved abortive. Similarly, repeated calls to the phone line of Mr. Mahmud Magaji, SAN, who also represented the Senate President at the tribunal on Friday, were not answered.\nSome senators loyal to Senate President Saraki have decried Saraki’s travails, saying that the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC was drifting Nigeria into a state of anarchy.\nCommenting on the development, Senator Sonni Ogbuoji, PDP, Ebonyi South noted that the current travail of the President of the Senate was an indication that the APC has no programme of governance for the country but to use state apparatus to witch-hunt perceived political enemies, adding that the CCT was treating Nigeria to a “new form of Constitution”, whereby a deputy director instead of the Attorney-General of the Federation was the one that took Saraki to court.\nDescribing Saraki’s treatment as politically motivated, Senator Ogbuoji noted that those behind the saga were not fighting for the growth of democracy, but for their selfish interest, which he said was to the detriment of the country.\nWhen asked whether he would advise the President of the Senate to resign in view of the dimension his opponents had taken to fight him, Senator Ogbuoji, who noted that there was no basis for anyone to demand for Saraki’s resignation, stressed that even if Saraki was eventually arrested and arraigned before the court, it would not remove him from his seat as the President of the Senate, adding that such would only be seen as a judicial process.\nAlso speaking, Senator Joshua Dariye (PDP, Plateau Central) who warned that the unfolding scenario was not a good development, however, suggested that the best way to handle the matter was for the warring factions to go for dialogue and resolve their differences, since the recent action against Saraki was still a fallout of the outcome of the formation of the leadership of the 8th Senate.\nHe said: “It is not a good development. Dialogue is the key to any success; so let them go into dialogue and settle their differences.”\nAnti-Saraki senators meet\nA source told Vanguard that members of the SUF, the group of Senators who are in support of the position of the All Progressives Congress (APC) on the leadership of the Senate have continued their consultations in readiness for the fallout of the CCT trial of Saraki.\nIt was gathered that the SUF has decided to lie low and allow the ongoing trial get to a head, as they continue the consultations behind the scene. A source said that the senators cannot say for certainty what would happen during the week, but many of them were said to be banking on the government “handling the assignment for them.”\nThe SUF Senators: Abu Ibrahim, Kabiru Marafa, Ajayi Borofice, Olugbenga Ashafa, Suleiman Hunkuyi, Banabas Gemade, Ahmed Lawan and George Akume among others came up to support Senator Ahmed Lawan during the fight for the position of Senate Presidency, which Saraki won.\nAs members of SUF are consulting, Saraki’s supporters, mostly of the Like Minds Senators (LMS) were also moving to consolidate the Senate President’s hold on the red chamber.\nAccording to a source, one of the forces against Saraki was pushing for an “Obasanjo option,” which would be to pull through the planned arrest and detention of the Senate President irrespective of the CCT order on the issue.\nThose behind this agenda are claiming that the CCT is not lower than the High Court and that its orders can only be referred to the Court of Appeal.\nIt was also gathered that the position of this camp is that the CCT could be made to get Saraki “out of the way” while the issue of control of the Senate would be sorted out on resumption.\nOthers are, however, expressing caution that the “Obasanjo option” could look drastic and reduce the government’s democratic credentials, especially as the government is still trying to get off the fallout of the invasion of Akwa-Ibom Government House.\nThe source said: “The noise by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) is also unsettling the plans. If the nation had remained quiet as it was before now, the authorities can go all out after the Senate President under the guise of fighting corruption,” a source close to the party said, adding that the two divides in the APC camp are weighing the best option going forward.\nIt was also gathered that loyalists of the Senate President have decided to hold a Unity meeting of all Senators on September 28, a day before the 29th resumption date.\nCCB member faults trial\nMeanwhile, there was a new dimension to the case against Saraki, yesterday, as a member of the CCB said that the entire trial was needless and in contradiction with the process stipulated in the Code of Conduct Bureau and Tribunal Act.\nThe member of the Bureau noted that the Section of the Act was not complied with before the Senate President was charged before the tribunal, adding, “If it had been complied with, the man will probably not even need to get to court at all, even if he committed all we are charging him with. Once he admits the inconsistency and regularise them”.\nAccording to the member who spoke on condition of anonymity said if the Bureau had followed the provision of Section 3(d) of its own law, it will not rush to trial, but invite Saraki to come and defend whatever inconsistency or infraction that may have been discovered in his asset declarations, adding that the normal procedure according to Section 3(d) of the Act was that the Bureau should set up a committee to determine whether an infraction has been committed by any public officer after submitting his/her asset declaration forms.\nSection 3(d) of the CCB Act states that: “The functions of the Bureau shall be ….to receive complaints about non-compliance with or breach of this Act and where the Bureau considers it necessary to do so, refer such complaints to the Code of Conduct Tribunal established by Section 20 of this Act in accordance with Section 20 to 25 of this Act.\n“Provided that where the person concerned makes a written admission of such breach or non-compliance, no reference to the Tribunal shall be necessary.”\nThe source recalled that it is this same refusal to follow procedure stipulated in his own law that led to the collapse of the case filed by the Bureau against Asiwaju Bola Tinubu in 2011, adding that members who observed this anomaly were dissatisfied with the unilateral action of the CCB chairman, Mr. Sam Saba who did not consult with other members before referring the matter to the tribunal.\nMeanwhile, Senators have kept mum since the matter came up, even as the Chairman, Ad- hoc Committee on Media and Publicity, Senator Dino Melaye, APC, Kogi West has failed to issue an official statement from the Senate, even as Senators called to speak vehemently refused to make comments.\nThere are also strong indications that Senate President Bukola Saraki may not honour the order of the Code of Conduct Tribunal that the Inspector General of Police, IGP, Solomon Arase should arrest and produce him in Court today.\nThough, Senate President Saraki was said not to be in town, but when Vanguard contacted his Special Adviser, Media and Publicity, Yusuph Olaniyonu, he said the Senate President was in town.\nDon’t be influenced IEDPU urges CCB\nThe Ilorin Emirate Descendant Progressive Union (IEDPU) has described Senate President Saraki’s current travails at the CCT as politically-motivated.\nThe union therefore cautioned the CCB against being used to achieve political gains, adding that the board should do its job devoid of external interference.\nNational President of IEDPU, Alhaji Abdulhamid Adi wondered why CCB failed to raise any issue concerning the Senate President’s asset declaration forms since 2003.\nAlhaji Adi added that the 12 years interval to unearth the alleged issue by the CCB and the way the CCT is handling the issue is suspicious.\n“I see it more or less as political persecution. It is purely political. Maybe there are some political opponents that are trying to get at him,” he said.\nMEF begs NU, MBF to intervene\nAlso Group known as ‘Maja Elders Forum’ (MEF) has urged President Buhari to intervene.\nIn a statement, MEF Coordinator, Alhaji Kayode Yusuf, appealed to the Northern Union (NU) and Middle Belt Forum (MBF), the two bodies, Saraki’s biological father Olusola Saraki had brought into prominence in the nation’s socio -political landscape, to meddle in the “persecution of Bukola Saraki’s family.”\nThe statement which was entitled: ‘Save Bukola Saraki’s Life: a Passionate Appeal to President Buhari,’ the group believed that the recent invitation of Saraki’s wife Oluwatoyin by the Economic and Financial Crime Commission (EFCC) and his attempted prosecution by the CCT might not be unconnected with the rising political profile of the former Governor of Kwara state.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"http://www.vanguardngr.com/2015/09/go-defend-yourself-buhari-tells-saraki/","2":"3676","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9996853471"},{"0":"42 Boko Haram suspects arrested in Lagos, Ogun\nArmy alleges plot to attack Southwest\n20 feared dead in Kano bombings\nForty-two suspected Boko Haram members were paraded yesterday by the Army in Lagos.\nThey were arrested in various parts of Lagos and Ogun states, after fleeing the military intervention in some parts of the North. The suspects were arrested between July 12 and 23.\nParading the suspects at the headquarters of the 81 Division, the General Officer Commanding (GOC), Gen. Obi Umahi, said they were seized during raids done in conjunction with intelligence operatives following plans by the sect to unleash terror in parts of the Southwest.\nOne of the suspects, Ibrahim Abubakar Bori, said they took part in several major operations in Borno State, where several military personnel and civilians have been killed since the insurgency started in 2009.\n“We were involved in several major operations in Maiduguri, where several security agents and civilians were killed.\n“I and some others here were recruited by Mallam Hassan Ibrahim.”\nIbrahim, 22, admitted recruiting some of the suspects and disclosed that he went with Ibrahim Ismaili and Alhaji Black to kill a soldier and a man described as Buka.\nHe said: “We rode in a tricycle and it was Alhaji Black that pulled the trigger.\n“I met both Ismaili and Alhaji Black in Lagos, while I was riding Okada. We all went to Maiduguri, where we carried out some operations.”\nHowever, some of the suspects denied being terrorists, alleging that they had been in Lagos for many years.\nBlack, who was indicted by Ismaili, said he had been staying in Lagos for about five years, riding Okada (commercial motorcycle).\nHe said the army came to Kirikiri to arrest some suspects and he was taken along with them.\nThe Army said the raids were conducted at Ibafo trailer park and Ileke new trailer garage in Ogun State; Aviation Quarters at Mafoluku, Oshodi; Ketu/Mile 2 Motor Park; Orile Trailer Park; Lekki new extension and Bar Beach, which are fast becoming Boko Haram terrorist enclaves.\nGen. Umahi said the suspects, who were arrested at various intervals, gave information that led to the arrest of others.\nThe GOC reiterated security agencies’ determination to rid Nigeria of terrorists, adding that the suspects would be handed over to security agencies.\nGen. Umahi, however, refused to disclose if weapons were recovered during the raids.\nHe said: “In response to intelligence report on the influx of Boko Haram terrorist elements into Lagos and Ogun states, 81 Division headquarters organised and conducted raids with intelligence operatives in these states between July 12 and 23.\n“The Boko Haram trickling influx is adduced to their plan to unleash terror in some parts of the Southwest.\n“During interrogation, they confessed to have participated in various major terrorist attacks in the North, especially Maiduguri, where majority of the suspects fled from.\n“We are bent on ensuring that Lagos and its environs remain safe for Nigerians and will not hesitate to fish out criminals,” Gen. Umahi said.\nSecurity agents March 14, raided Ijora Badia, Lagos following intelligence reports, which led to the arrest of over 14 suspected Boko Haram members.\nThe suspects were said to have disclosed during interrogation, their planned massive attacks on Lagos, with designated 16 landmarks slated for simultaneous bomb blasts.\nThat foiled attack was the second in March. No fewer than three suspected Shiite sect members were arrested in Illorin, the Kwara State capital in February, with the allegation that they had plans to bomb Israeli and America’s interest in Lagos.\nThe group allegedly planned attacks on the Lagos offices of the U.S. Agency for International Development; the Haifa-based ZIM Integrated Shipping Services Limited and the Jewish Cultural Centre.\nAlso in June, the army said it arrested about 15 Boko Haram suspects at various parts of the metropolis, with most of them arrested at Ijora Badia and Kotankowa areas between February and May, who were handed over to security agencies.\nSophisticated weapons were recovered including explosives and remote controls during the previous raids\nThe vehicles that were to be used to transport the bombs to their designated places were also among other items recovered during the raid.\nWhen the Presidential Committee on Dialogue and Peaceful Resolution of Security, visited Lagos, it emerged that about 104 Boko Haram members arrested in the Northern part of the country, were being detained in Lagos prisons.","1":"http://thenationonlineng.net/new/42-boko-haram-suspects-arrested-in-lagos-ogun/","2":"983","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.999179244"},{"0":"Ojougboh was a courageous, outspoken personality, says Ibori\nFormer Delta state governor, James Onanefe Ibori has described as shocking, the death of a former member of the House of Representatives, Cairo Ojougboh.\nOjougboh, who represented the Ika federal constituency of Delta state in the House of Representatives from 2003-2007 reportedly slumped and died while watching the semi-final clash between the Super Eagles of Nigeria and the Bafana Bafana of South Africa on Wednesday, February 7.\nIbori, in a condolence message he signed, expressed shock, disbelief, and sadness over the sudden death of Ojougboh, who also served as a former Executive Director of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC).\nRead Also: Tinubu mourns late Cairo Ojougboh\nHe said: “I am devastated by the news of the death of Dr. Cairo Ojougboh, a very outspoken and courageous personality who served his community, Delta state, and Nigeria well in different capacities during his lifetime”.\n“Our paths crossed years back as students at the University of Benin.

The state has now recorded 50 cases from repatriated almajiris. Active cases have risen to 59.”\nBut Governor Ganduje in a statement said some of the almajirais also evacuated to Kano State during the exercise, tested positive for COVID-19 positive and that he did not make noise about it..\nGovernor Ganduje in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Abba Anwar, said among others, “We are not making politics out of it, no noise making. To put record straight on the movement of Almajirai across states of the federation and how Kano embarks on the exercise, “We agreed at the Northern Governors Forum that all Almajirai be moved to their states of origin. That is why we are sending, in good faith and procedures, all Almajirai that are not from Kano state to their respective states of origin. The exercise was not political and should not be politicized.\n“The way we are sending back almajiris to their states of origin, we are also receiving Almajiris from other states who are Kano indigenes. But the fact that we are not making noise about it does not mean they are all healthy without COVID-19 infections.\n“Let’s make it categorically clear that, some of the Almajiris brought to Kano during the exercise, are also COVID-19 positive, but we are not making politics out of it. Because we all believe that what they need most now, is not noise making or publicity. What they need at this critical point in time is, care giving.\n“People should also understand that, these children were not infected in the process of transporting them to their respective states. So noise making is not fit as a way forward. All we are doing is simply to comply with the Northern Governors’ Forum decision that all Almajiris in our states should be taken back to their respective states, simple,” the statement however reads.”\nMeanwhile, Coordinator, Kano State Task Force on Coronavirus, COVID-19, Dr Tijjani Hussain, yesterday said no fewer than 47 health workers in the state had tested positive for the virus.\nThe Coordinator who spoke during a briefing by the state taskforce on COVID-19 said with the additional 29 new cases recorded in the state Saturday night, “ we have recorded 576 confirmed cases, out of which 29 were new recorded on Saturday. Out of the total number of the confirmed cases, we also discharged 10 patients bringing it to 32 so far discharged. Similarly, out of the total number we have in Kano, we recorded three deaths on Saturday, making the total number of deaths recorded to be 21.\nIn a related development, Ganduje has told health workers in the private health facilities not to reject patients, noting that sending them away could equally mean helping COVID-19 to wreck more havoc on people.\nA statement by the Chief Press Secretary to Governor Ganduje, Abba Anwar, said among other “We don’t want you to be sending away patients who come to you for other illnesses.

They were, however, not named.\nThe commission also said that it had so far recovered a sum of N25.5billion out of the N1.143 trillion of total non-performing loans of the five banks.\nThe break-down of recovered debt and the banks are as follows;Â Intercontinental bank N7, 736, 571, 744.19; Finbank.N1, 590, 417, 332.05, AfribankN7, 551, 121, 378.69, Oceanic bankN8, 033, 481, 868.65; Union bank N659, 240, 400.78.\nThe Chairman of theÂ anti-graft agency, Mrs Farida Waziri, who made these disclosures at a briefing at the Ikoyi head office of the commission, also assured that the agency was â€œcommitted to recovering more money from loan defaulters,â€ adding, however, the EFCC was not out to criminalize loan procurement from banks.\nThe commission equally said it had agreed to obey a court order to set the former MDs of Finbank and Afribank, Messrs Oke Nwosu and Sebastian Adigwe respectively free. However, stringent conditions were attached.\nMeanwhile, the Nigerian Bar Association, NBA, yesterday faultedÂ WaziriÂ for cautioning the courts against granting frivolous interlocutory applications from former bank executives and bank debtors, saying that the commissionâ€™s position amounted to blackmail and arm-twisting the judiciary.\nSimilarly, the Chartered Institute of Personnel Management of Nigeria, CIPM, has faulted the involvement of the EFCC in recovery of funds from banksâ€™ debtors, saying its tactics show thatÂ the commission does not understand the workings of the banking sector.\nEFCC recovers N25.5billion from bank debtors\nMrs Waziri, who briefed newsmen in Lagos, gave a break-down of the money recovered for the banks. A break-down shows: Intercontinental bank .

They were, however, not named.\nShe further said that former MDs of Finbank and Afribank, Messrs Oke Nwosu and Sebastian Adigwe might be granted bail following a court order to that effect.\nHer words, â€œit is important to emphasize here that our efforts are not targeted at genuine business people who have existing credit obligation to banks and have dutifully complied with the terms of the facility.Â We are not out to criminalize legitimate borrowing from banks.\nWe are mindful of the fact that banking strives on robust credit administration system and we will respect the rights of customers to access funds from their banks in so far as the rules are followed.\nFor the borrowers, we have been able to group them into two categories; those who have legitimate business intension and have continued to service their loans and those whose loans do not follow due process and non- performing.\nâ€œIt is unfortunate that some of the banks chiefs in trouble at present abuse their offices by granting unsecured loans in total disregard to banking regulations to the second category of people.\nYou will agree with me that the amount owed by the later category has enormous effect on our national economy and every national must guard that seriously.â€\nMoments after Mrs Waziriâ€™s briefing, Mr. Jimoh Ibrahim told the commission that he had paid N3.1bn of the alleged loan owed Oceanic Bank, arguing, however, the bank had overcharged him on the said procured loan.\nAccording to him, â€œwe have paid Oceanic Bank N3.1bn and the rest of the account, we have to go through auditing as the bank has undertaken to reconcile the account and as soon as that is reconciled, if there is any figure against us it will be paid within 24 hours.\nOceanic alleged that we owe them N8b and we have paid N3.1b, that means it is remaining N4. 8b.

It later rose to 60 million litres per day, 55 million litres, while until today, no one actually knows the country’s daily fuel consumption.\nAs a result of this, the Federal Government set up a committee to determine Nigeria’s actual fuel consumption using advanced information and communication technology, as well as improved surveillance.\nIn its National Stock Reports released Wednesday, the DPR stated that as February 25, 2020, the cumulative stock of PMS at depots across the country was 915.772 million litres, dropping by 3.15 per cent from 945.6 million litres recorded February 24, 2020.\nThe DPR disclosed that the PMS stock was owned by the Petroleum Products Marketing Company, the downstream subsidiary of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, NNPC; as well as major and independent oil marketers.\nThe DPR attributed the decline in national PMS stock levels to vessel discharges and truck out activities across the depots.\nIt said “As at 25th February 2020, the cumulative depot stock of PMS at the depots was 915,771,566 litres (combined PMS stock owned by PPMC, major and independent marketers) vis-à-vis 945,604,305 litres on 24th February 2020 indicating a decrease of depot PMS stock due to vessel discharges and truck out activities (Table A and B) respectively at the depots.\n“Applying the estimated daily national demand of 38,200,000 (thirty-eight million two hundred thousand) litres, available depot PMS stock of 915,771,566 litres is sufficient for 24 days.”\nThe DPR report further stated that as at February 25th, 2020, stock levels in 40 depots in Lagos stood at 539.99 million litres; while in Calabar/Eket, 82.97 million litres of PMS were available in 11 depots across the state.\nIn Warri, Port Harcourt, Umuahia and Kaduna, PMS stock levels stood at 146.94 million litres, 129.19 million litres, 6.99 million litres and 9.68 million respectively.\nFurthermore, the report disclosed that on February 25, 2020, as at 600hours, seven vessels discharged 61.055 million litres of PMS at depots in the Lagos Zone, bringing PMstock levels in Lagos to 537.95 million litres after daily truck out.\nIn its 2019 Benchmarking Exercise Report, released weekend, the Nigeria Natural Resource Charter, NNRC, confirmed the difficulty that had persisted in determining Nigeria’s actual fuel consumption and also highlighted recent efforts by the government to reverse this trend.\nIt said, “In addition, steps were observed to increase the monitoring of the supply and distribution of refined petroleum to have a fair assessment of the country’s consumption level.

I completed the task and submitted four volumes of its Report between February and May, 2012”.\nThis Report, Sunday Vanguard has been told, forms one of the many inputs from bodies with a view to repositioning INEC – at least, that was the position canvassed by Jega.\nApart from the PwC Report, Sunday Vanguard gathered that another independent committee, Registration and Election Review Committee, RERC, chaired by Professor Adele Jinadu, was also set up and its report submitted to the Commission.\nHowever, the Report at the centre of the brewing power tussle in INEC is the Senior Staff Establishments Committee (SSEC) Report on the PWC Report, which was submitted.\nThe INEC National Commissioners’ position was that they ought to exercise some executive functions and control, just as they sought to press home the point that Jega was merely a first among equals.\nJega scoofed at that suggestion, submitting that “the understanding of the Committee that all National Commissioners including the Chairman, are “Executive”, with the latter as being the Chief Executive”, is wrong and has no basis in law or in existing practice”.\n”Since the establishment of INEC National Commissioners are National Commissioners, and the Chairman is Chairman and Chief Executive Commissioner, as well as the Chief Executive in law and in practice. Even more surprising is the laboured attempts to depict National Commissioners and the Chairman as equals. One wonders why drawing this awkward parallel should become a preoccupation of the SSEC”, the INEC Chairman thundered.\nHe added: “It will be unconstitutional for the National Commissioners to exercise any ‘management and control of any employee in the discharge of his day-to-day responsibilities in the Commission”.\nThe response of Jega, though hinged on a plethora of logic, legalese and common practice, is being frowned at by some of the National Commissioners.\nIn fact, at the recent Retreat by INEC at PROTEA HOTEL, Maryland, Lagos, last month, an air of unease was pervasive.\nIn Jega’s memo, titled INEC Chairman’s comments on the Senior Staff Establishments Committee (SSEC) Report on the PWC Report, the commissioners “were made to understand that there is a world of difference between what they desired and what was practicable in law”, a source at the meeting told Sunday Vanguard.\nWhereas the commissioners had raised the issue of executive responsibilities, Jega, in his memo, explained that there were “responsibilities very important to the discharge of the Commission’s mandate, time consuming and (enough to) justify the full-time nature of appointment of the National Commissioners”.\nThe INEC boss added: “If these additional responsibilities are well conceptualized and done properly, at both the strategic and policy levels, the National Commissioners would be very busy indeed, with tremendous value-added to the overall attainment of the mandate of INEC; these responsibilities, though very important, are not “executive” in nature; and challenges have arisen when the distinction is blurred and some National Commissioners see themselves as “executives” over and above the head of departments/units (and the Secretary) in the day-to-day running of the affairs of the Commission.\n(There are examples where National Commissioners felt that directors and heads of unit cannot deal directly with the Chairman without going through them, or where Chairman of Committees tried to take procurement decisions and impose them on the departments). I received reports of such complaints and perhaps in its interactions with the staff of the Commission, the PWC also received such complaints.”\n‘NATIONAL COMMISSIONERS ARE NOT EXECUTIVES’\n“For the avoidance of doubt”, Jega continued, “nowhere in the Constitution or the Electoral Act is it stated or implied that National Commissioners are “executives” or have “executive” duties/responsibilities. Certainly, Sections 14(1) and 15 of the Third Schedule 1999 Constitution neither explicitly state nor implied so. In other words, there is nowhere that full time Commissionership is equated to executive role.\n“The essential point is, the Commission cannot be called a Board, even though some of its regular meetings at the highest level are akin to those of what is normally called a Board and the National Commissioners are not akin to “mere Board Members”, given their enormous additional roles/responsibilities. However, they have no “executive” roles as the SSEC implies in its use of the terms “management and control”.\n“It is a misnomer to place the Chairman and Chief Electoral Officer on the same level of executive responsibilities or “management and control” in an Organogram with the National Commissioners. The legally defined responsibilities and job descriptions (and even remunerations!) are not the same. This is taking the notion of “first among equals” to a ridiculous extreme.”\nJega concluded his response with some recommendations.\n“Arising from my review of and comments on the SSEC Report on PWC Report, I wish to recommend as follows|:\n“1.At this Retreat we should not conflate the issues of restructuring and reorganisation of the administrative structure of INEC and those of making National Commissioners as Executives. If we have to do the latter at all, the best forum might be in our interactions with the members of the National Assembly as they undertake the review of the Constitution and the Electoral Act. We may then wish to ask them to make explicit provisions in the laws as to who is the Accounting Officer of INEC, whether National Commissioners are also Executives and so on.\n“2.Let us then review the recommendation of the PWC, those of the SSEC and mine and see what kind of trim structure we may come up with, to reduce over departmentalization and sectionalisation, to remove duplication of functions and responsibilities, and to make for efficient and effective service delivery of INEC’s programmes and projects even before the Constitution and the Electoral Act are further amended”.\nThe correlation being drawn between preparations for the 2015 elections and the seeming over-concentration of people from a section of the country in INEC, is the “possibility of using the personnel to engender a systematic process that would determine a particular outcome for that year’s election”.\nIn a recent advertorial signed by ELECTION INTEGRITY NETWORK, and titled THE TAKE-OVER OF INEC, the group quoted a publication where it was stated that INEC’s nine-man Strategic Planning Committee is made up of seven person of northern extraction with just two people from the south, just as its committees on Logistics, Operations, Procurement, Finance and General Purpose, ICT and Political Monitoring are all allegedly chaired by northerners.\nIn the conversation with Idowu, yesterday, he said “some of the things being published by some people in that regard are laughable because the decisions taken at the Commission reflect a collective, hinged on consensus”.\nINEC is composed of the National Chairman and 12 National Commissioners, along with Resident Electoral Commissioners in each of the states of the federation and the Federal Capital Territory, FCT, Abuja.\nDETAILS OF JEGA’S MEMO NEXT SUNDAY.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"http://www.vanguardngr.com/2012/09/2015-jega-national-commissioners-on-war-path/#sthash.vkHxupA1.dpuf","2":"1927","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999961853"},{"0":"Tension in Bayelsa communities as gunmen kill soldier, steal service rifle\nBy Simon Utebor, Yenagoa\nUnidentified gunmen have killed a soldier and made away with his service rifle in a border town between Apoi and Azuzuama communities in Southern Ijaw Local Government Area of Bayelsa State.\nThe incident, which reportedly occurred on Monday evening, has thrown the two communities into panic over looming fear of military retaliation and possible invasion.\nMany indigenes and residents of the communities were said to have fled to nearby communities and some to the state capital, Yenagoa.\nIt was learnt that some residents who have no relatives in the neighbouring communities have gone to hide in the forests to escape any imminent invasion by soldiers.\nIt was gathered that the murdered soldier was on an official duty to Apoi community for a pipeline surveillance job when he was gunned down.\nHe was said to have been killed in the bush between the boundary of Apoi and Azuzuama communities, where there is a pipeline.\nThe assailants reportedly carted away with his AK 47 rifle before community members got to the spot.\nSources in Apoi and Azuzuama communities confirmed that some residents had started fleeing the community for fear of reprisals by the military.\nA source, who spoke in confidence, said: “People have started running away from their communities for fear of reprisals by the military.

We are peace loving community and we are working with the relevant authorities to bring the soldier’s killers to book.\n“No indigenes of Apoi can carry out such heinous crime. I believe that those who carried out the evil act are not from Apoi community.”\nThe Public Relations Officer, 16 Brigade, Nigerian Army, Captain Tonye Wenke, said efforts were on to reach out to the appropriate quarters to confirm the incident.\nSpokesman for the joint military task force in the Niger Delta, Operation Delta Safe (OPDS), Major Victor Olukoya, said only the headquarters of the Nigerian Army could speak on the issue.\n“It is an operational issue and issues that have to do with operations are directed to Directorate of Media Operation in Abuja,” he said.\nBut reacting to the development, the leadership of the Movement for the Survival of Izon Ethnic Nationality in the Niger Delta (MOSIEND), Apoi Clan, has condemned the act, describing it as barbaric and inhuman.\nChairman, MOSIEND, Apoi clan, Comrade Fidelis Duba, called on hoodlums operating in the Apoi creek and other areas to desist from such nefarious activities, assuring the security agencies that the clan would work with them to fish out the culprits.","1":"https://thenationonlineng.net/tension-in-bayelsa-communities-as-gunmen-kill-soldier-steal-service-rifle/","2":"689","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999446869"},{"0":"By Olasunkanmi Akoni & Monsur Olowoopejo\nLAGOS – Worried by the incessant killings and other electoral violence that had continued to trail the ongoing democratic transition, Presidential candidate of the All Nigeria Peoples Party, ANPP, Mallam Ibrahim Shekarau; Governor Babatunde Fashola of Lagos State; Olisa Agbakoba, SAN and the former Presidential candidate of the Social Democratic Mega Party, SDMP, Prof. Pat Utomi, will today lead other Nigerians on peace rally in Lagos.\nAmong those expected at the rally in Lagos, includes Mr. Femi Falana, members of the Oodua Peoples’ Congress, OPC and National Association of Nigerian Students, NANS.

Nigeria is not bereft of good governance ideas and plans. However, a combination of institutional weaknesses and a lack of political will meant that various policies and strategies are poorly implemented leading to poor outcomes for the people. Hence, the overall goal of my administration shall be to streamline governance, and make it more responsive, transformative, effective, less transactional, and therefore efficient and cost-effective.\nWhat kind of leadership do you hope to provide Nigerians?\nThinking through 2023 and beyond, we must think seriously about a leadership that is imbued with competence, capacity, credibility and commitment. Accordingly, we will pursue intangible assets of good governance, rule of law, and security of lives and properties; we will ensure that we have these assets in place and stress asset optimization.\nAfrica has looked to Nigeria for leadership but has found it absent and wanting. What would you do to restore leadership?\nOur foreign policy has always been Afrocentric. So, Africa will remain the centre-piece of our foreign policy. We will strike a strategic balance that allows us to promote and protect national interests while meeting our ECOWAS obligations. We will rebuild Nigeria’s military power, promote economic growth, and enhance its technological prowess with a view to improving Nigeria’s diplomatic influence in sub-regional, regional and global affairs.\nRestoring leadership will require that we reassert proactively, Nigeria’s leadership role in African affairs through constructive engagement, peacekeeping duties, and using existing sub-regional and regional forums as well as bilateral platforms for dialogue on current and emerging challenges. We will continue to enhance our sphere of influence via peacekeeping, and trade and investment initiatives.\nThe sense of being part of a united country has been eroded. How do you see yourself reuniting Nigerians?\nSecuring, uniting and making Nigeria productive require steady and trusted hands. We shall ensure that in moving Nigeria forward, no state or community will be left behind. Pursuant to its statutory responsibility to protect, our government will promote equity in power and resource sharing. There must be a renewed sense of patriotism; that will come through leadership by example.\nDo you think that states and regions need more autonomy?\nYou are indirectly asking about restructuring. I consider restructuring a process, not a one-off event. Yes, if we have a real federation, the federating units will enjoy discernible autonomy. Resources will also be shared equitably. A higher derivation paid to oil or solid minerals-producing states will not be tantamount to other states not receiving federal allocations that should keep them viable. We must transcend the rhetoric that bedevils a robust debate on some of these national questions.\nIn the past, the ethnic identity of the President has resulted in a preponderance of unqualified people being appointed to key positions. How will you address this problem?\nWe will respect the principles of federal character, affirmative action and gender balance; but no longer at the expense of merit.\nHow do you propose to address the security challenges in the north and those of oil theft?\nThe relevant security institutions and agencies exist. Supporting national security-enabling documents and strategies also exist. We will tweak the security architecture, which will entail reform of the security sector and governance. We will restructure, reequip and reorient the Nigerian Police: This will include three-level policing- Federal, state and community. We will build a compact, robust and ready Mobile Police Force with rapid response deployment capabilities; and legislate the establishment of state police based on community policing. We will raise the population-to-police officer ratio to a higher level.\nThere would be a properly manned, equipped and technologically driven security system with particular emphasis on re-focusing the military on external threats and border protection and police on internal security threats and law enforcement; swift prosecution of criminals, bandits and terrorists; enhanced coordination among security agencies; and upholding the rule of law.\nWe would integrate the activities of the National Intelligence and Security Agencies by establishing a central reporting intelligence loop under the authority the Minister of National & Homeland Security; Establish a National Command and Control Coordination Center for the efficient management of actionable intelligence, resource allocation and force deployment. Membership should consist of representatives of all security agencies on a need-to-know basis.\nI believe in continuity in governance. But each extant policy must be considered and if need be, reviewed on its merit. The oil theft is not petty pilfering. It is an organized crime by a syndicate that involves a certain degree of sophisticated intelligence and logistical arrangement. We must admit that oil theft is happening because there is domestic and external collusion. The government and the people have the collective responsibility to protect national assets. On my watch, those responsibilities will be accorded high priority.\nForeign and National Security policy initiatives, might in the long term entail rebuilding, repositioning and sustaining ECOMOG, as the arrowhead of a West African Security partnership. This is to counter terrorist threats and international subversion of the sovereignty of the West African region of which Nigeria must reestablish her place as a regional power.\nWill you be maintaining the policy of fixed exchange rates coupled with heavy government borrowing? Will you be adhering to the fiscal responsibility laws?\nWe will abide by the fiscal responsibility laws. Despite the exigency and convenience which the two-tier foreign exchange regime offers, it has become an albatross. Hence that arrangement will be critically reviewed, adjusted or even eliminated. We will explore ways of cushioning the forex demands by mainstreaming those components of Diaspora remittances that remain opaque and informal. With proper policy and planning, we can expect to boost and leapfrog the current $20 billion in remittances to $40b to $60b annually. That will translate to about 14% of our total GDP.\nThe youth have often felt left out in the country, especially in the light of central Bank policies on tech companies. Will you reconsider these policies? How do you propose to address the brain drain?\nWe are challenged by high youth unemployment, which stands at 33.3%; 54% for the youth; and 20 million out-of-school-children. We must give this country back to the Nigerian youths. Half of our 200 million people are below the age of 30.\nHarnessing our national youth strength and demographic dividends intelligently must start with curbing the high youth unemployment and creating funding access to enable our youths to become entrepreneurs and drivers of our Small and Medium Scale enterprises (SMEs).\nWe will work to bring down the unemployment rate to fewer than 20 per cent over the next four years if elected. Part of our objectives on the economy will be focused on supporting job creation given its impact on the economy as well as poverty alleviation.\nWe will review the legislation guiding the fund access modalities to Universal Basic Education Commission (UBEC), and the Tertiary Education Trust Fund (TETFund), to redress prevailing bottlenecks, create greater transparency, and ensure increased flexibility, and optimum availability of funds required to meet the educational need of the Nigerian students they are meant to serve.\nWe will explore ways and means of tapping in on technology transfer from the Diaspora; we will also explore ways of reversing the enormous brain drain that has been debilitating for our country. We will trigger every known technological and knowledge transfer initiator. Nigeria’s brain drain will be turned into brain gain.\nWill the corrupt be allowed to keep their loot? How much focus will be given to probes?\nWe will have zero tolerance for corruption; block leakages and cut the cost of governance. Our total commitment to transparency and accountability in government business is the only credible way to achieve limited to zero corruption.\nThe policies required to fight corruption already exist; it is the political will to implement them that has been lacking. My governance modalities have always been forward-looking and will remain so. We will negotiate the return of our stolen national wealth from the custodial countries.\nWill you be maintaining the subsidies on electricity and petroleum?\nThere are two elements of subsidy- the corruption component and the real subsidy component. The oil subsidy arrangement as it stands is fraught with criminality. It is unacceptable.\nFor corruption, we will deal with it decisively which will reduce the subsidy cost by over 50%. There will be weighted measures and counter-balance policies and programmes to cushion the impact of the removal of oil subsidy, if and when it is removed. The difference is that now, only some sacred and self-entitled few benefit from the oil subsidy. That narrative will change.\nWe will support local refining for domestic use and priced strictly in Naira. Starting with all government vehicles, we will transition to gas-powered cars.\nWhile we support private enterprises will you take measures to ensure that Nigeria does not get dominated by a small group of oligopolists and monopolists?\nFree enterprise is about market forces and keen competition. These will occur at different levels. If we liberalize access to funding, SMEs will flourish; they have a role to play that giant company no longer play.\nWe will enforce the legal framework protecting foreign investors and their indigenous partners. This is the only way to tamper with monopoly and capital flight.\nIn respect of gender equality in business and politics, Nigeria is behind many African countries. Will you be taking this as a priority?\nAs governor of Anambra State, my administration achieved close to a 60-40 gender balance in appointive and elective positions. The national target has hovered around 30-35%. We intend to progressively aim for between 35-40%, with aggressive gender mainstreaming action plans and rigid benchmarks.\nThe Central Bank has lost the confidence of many inside and outside of Nigeria. What do you propose to do about this?\nAs part of our monetary policy, we will seek to reestablish the independence of the CBN; and commit to a credible and transparent plan to normalize the exchange rate and bring inflation to single digits.\nWe will remove import and forex restrictions and insist on a single forex market. The current system penalizes exporters who bring in forex by forcing them to sell at a rate that they are unable to source for forex when they need to purchase forex. This multiple exchange rate regime encourages capital flight and deters investment, which has further worsened Nigeria’s forex situation.\nDo you see yourself deepening or reducing ties with China?\nOur trade policies will always be predicated on what is in our best national interest. Trade partners who offer us comparative advantage will be considered. However, we will give primacy to our Africa Trade Treaty obligations.\nBeneficiaries of China’s goodwill and investments in Africa are many. So too are the countries defaulting on their Chinese loans. The trend is deeply alarming. Salutary, as it may seem, we must approach such engagement with our national interest uppermost in our minds.\nWhat policy will your administration have towards Russia and Ukraine?\nWe maintain very cordial relations with Russia and Ukraine. Evidently, this war, in conventional terms, will need to be resolved at the negotiating table. We support the cessation of hostilities agreement under the auspices of the United Nations.\nAs young people we are concerned with university education. What will you do about the ongoing strike by university teachers?\nWe will pursue the global best practices and standards within the available resource. Certainly, in the medium and long term, 14% of budgetary funding for education is within the realm of possibility. We will strive to be globally competitive by increasing funding ad ensuring that the (TETFund) resources are redirected to the funding of the Universities and other higher institutions robustly with a view to ending the perennial strikes by University Staff and workers.\nWhat would be your top priorities on getting into office?\n• Production-centered growth for food security and export;\n• Securing and Uniting Nigeria;\n• Effective legal and institutional reforms (rule of law, corruption and government effectiveness);\n• Leapfrogging Nigeria from oil to the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR);\n• Expanding physical infrastructure through market-driven reforms (unleashing growth-enabling entrepreneurship and market-creating innovations);\n• Human capital development that empowers competitiveness; and\n• Robust foreign policy that restores Nigeria’s strategic relevance.\nHow did Nigeria address the COVID challenge and what will you need to do to address future epidemics and pandemics?\nNigeria’s initial response to the COVID crisis was lacklustre and uninspiring, but her efforts when compared to those of bigger and better-developed Western countries were not that poor.\nWhat was lacking was experts who were proactive and could prioritize; people who understood how to manage complex emergencies. There were evident critical gaps in response capacity. We will address such gaps by putting in place a national resilience strategy.\nDo you think that government needs to be slimmed down?\nCertainly. We have a bloated federal bureaucracy; hence we are spending more on recurrent expenses. And we are borrowing frivolously. I am not against loans per se; but we must stop borrowing for consumption. All loans must be invested in regenerative projects. We must operate within available resources and strive for a balanced national budget as cost-saving measures. Ending the leakages including the subsidy regime and improving our tax regime should do the magic.\nIn a Presidential system Presidents often find that they are hamstrung by the legislature especially when that body is dominated by members of opposition parties. How will you handle the National Assembly in this regard?\nPresidential power as we know is the power of persuasion. Members of the National Assembly have a vested interest in making their constituencies work. Their respective constituencies invariably form the presidential or national constituency. Policies that present win-win scenarios for national and federal constituencies will definitely attract bi-partisan support.\nDo you have any plans to address the issue of the humongous salaries and allowances earned by the National Assembly?\nSimply, we have to cut costs. There are no two ways about it.\nThe structure and size of the civil service remain a major constraint for development in the country how do you plan to deal with the issue?\nLack of political will and lack of synergy between the Executive and Legislative arms has resulted in costly inertia in tackling our oversized government. The result is persisting turf fights and competition among several overlapping agencies, and the resultant wastages. Cost-cutting measures must start with rationalization and harmonization. Pruning the size of the government will be imperative.\nThe Oronsaye committee report of April 2012, recommended the abolition and merger of 102 government agencies and parastatals, while some were listed to be self-funding. What was called for was extreme but practical rationalization measures.\nWill you be implementing the Oronsaye report?\nThat is affirmative. That is the only way to make governance efficient, cost-effective and productive.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"https://www.vanguardngr.com/2022/10/what-i-will-do-if-elected-president-peter-obi/","2":"3238","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999637604"},{"0":"…As A’Court dismisses APGA’s application for joinder\nTHE All Progressives Congress, APC, in Rivers state has asked the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, to postpone elections in the state.\nThis is as the Court of Appeal in Port Harcourt, Rivers State, yesterday, dismissed the joinder application by the All Progressives Ground Alliance, APGA, in the case between the All Progressives Congress, APC, factions of Tonye Cole and Sen Magnus Abe and 42 other candidates over earlier Federal High Court ruling.\nThe three man appeal panel led by Justice Ali Gumel, in dismissing the application, held that the party seeking to be joined failed to provide sufficient legal interest in the matter it wished to join.\nINEC had disqualified the APC from contesting the election over the crisis which affected its primaries.\nThere are two factions of the party in the state.

The existence of bloated governments in Nigeria which was attributed to ‘petroleum mentality’- a mindset which encourages irresponsible spending (squander mania) was roundly condemned.\nIt was argued pointblank that because Nigeria collects ample revenue from God-given petroleum resources to which it invests nothing, it sustains bloated bodies like a cabinet of 43 Ministers whereas a prudent nation would not go for more than 20. What needs to be added is that the inevitable consequence of the tendency to have a bloated body is that government becomes too bogus to function well.\nMany people may not have seen this correlation between obesity and lethargy, but in reality it was a feature of the news of the week-the deportation of Nigerians from South Africa. Why was our Ministry of Foreign Affairs caught napping? Perhaps half of those who should have articulated the issues at stake were quite busy under-cutting one another to get into the good books of their three Ministers.\nThus, while our officials were involuntarily pursuing cosmetic matters, South Africa was able to find the effrontery to deal with Nigeria as she did last week. In truth, if we had maintained the proactive momentum of the Murtala/Obasanjo era in our foreign relations, South Africa would never have dared us. It would be recalled that in the 70s, we had only one Minister of External Affairs-Joseph Garba- and he put Nigeria up there.\nIt is thus instructive that Nigeria whose glorious foreign policy was pro-actively managed by one Minister in the past now has to employ three Ministers for the same job!\nIt is not uncharitable to argue that it is because there are too many ‘leading’ hands in the foreign affairs ministry that she now operates a ‘wisdom after event’ strategy in which South Africa takes a position on a subject and leaves Nigeria to begin to leak her wounds while threatening just to reciprocate. No serious nation can present reciprocity as its own initiative when it is a principle inherent in foreign relations.\nThe South African behaviour was obviously not a surprise; we saw it coming. Indeed, our foreign affairs ministry by its own admission was aware of the events which preceded the deportation of some Nigerians and yet waited for our nation to be humiliated before waking up from its slumber.\nAnyway, thank God for South Africa, our foreign affairs ministry appears to be awake now having also deported some South Africans. But who else is working and how do we prevent him from returning to official indolence would depend on how well we can reshape our structure. Here, we insist that there is no better way of making our government responsive than to right-size it. Every other nation is busy doing just that by searching for an appropriate functional and cost effective framework of governance.\nAs if Nigeria is aware of this and would not like to be left behind, it has now and again set up one panel or the other to restructure its public service. We have had that of Mbanefo 1959, Morgan 1963, Adebo 1971, Udoji 1972-4, Dotun Philips 1985, Ayida 1994, Joda 1999 and Danjuma 2010 to mention but a few.\nIn spite of all of these, Nigeria has not been able to follow international best practices in the management of governance. All she does is to set up panels whose reports are never implemented hence the nation’s bureaucracy has remained bloated and unwieldy. In the face of global economic downturn, Nigeria has no option but to evolve ways of becoming prudent. First, it is time to streamline the structure of government by doing away with what we can avoid.\nSecond, it is only a lean structure that can enable government effectively and efficiently manage her resources. Against this backdrop, it is obvious that with a Police Service Commission (PSC), the nation does not require a Ministry of Police Affairs. The nation will save costs if it drops the Ministry which duplicates the function of the PSC. Indeed, such a step would reduce the number of bodies which exist just to award contracts.\nSimilarly, it is arguable if there is really a need for a Ministry of Petroleum. No one can point at the difference between now that we have a Petroleum Minister and several years back when there was none. The President can have an adviser on Petroleum matters without necessarily establishing a full fletched ministry for the purpose. The NNPC should be able to provide the workforce that is needed to manage the sector.\nAlso, there are certain functions which should not be assigned to a Ministry because of the nature of bureaucracy. One such assignment is anything that government is anxious to accomplish speedily.\nConsidering the deprivations of the Niger Delta people caused by oil-the nation’s main source of wealth, everyone agrees with the decision of government that developing the Niger Delta region is a priority. Interestingly, government ill-advisedly handed the assignment to a Ministry thereby subjecting the implementation of the policy to red-tapism.\nIn earnest, if well focused and properly funded, the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) would do a better job because it would not be bogged down like a ministry in the endless exchange of memos without a purpose. Oh yes, the Nigerian civil service has a long list of officials who have no specific duties and are thus engaged in the transmission of purposeless messages.\nEven if for the purpose of this piece, no reference is made to the performance of the civil service, its numerical strength alone calls for concern. At the highest level of permanent secretary, the figure is embarrassing. In the office of the head of the civil service alone, there are six permanent secretaries.\nThere is one in charge of Common Services Office (CSO), another for Management Development Office (MDO) and yet another for Career Management Office (CMO). The other three Permanent Secretaries are in charge of Establishment and Records Office (ERO), Management Services Office (MSO) and the Bureau of Public Service Reform (BPSR).\nA similar long list of permanent secretaries is to be found in the office of the Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF). This arrangement exists because ours is a profligate nation. We donot need more than one permanent secretary in each of the two offices in issue. There is therefore the need to drastically reduce the number and plough the savings made to other uses.\nIn addition, there is the urgent need to appropriately target our ministries to meet their vision of ‘implementing Government’s policies and programmes for rapid and sustainable development’ otherwise, if they are asked to document their annual activities at the end of the year, many would use flowing language to record only what they had planned to do and not what was done. For such an unwieldy system, expansion does not arise because the world over, big governments are now obsolete and are seen as a liability.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"https://www.vanguardngr.com/2023/09/anguish-chaos-gridlock-over-intl-flight-relocation/amp/Everywhere","2":"1509","3":"Travel","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999961853"},{"0":"By Ochereome Nnanna\nALTHOUGH there were varied positions on the matter, in the end the General Sani Abacha administration created Bayelsa out of Rivers State in 1996”\nThe circumstances behind my joining a delegation for the burial of His Royal Majesty, Sunday Nnanta Woluchem, the Epara Rebisi XI of Port Harcourt on Saturday, April 21, 2012 is encapsulated in the above quote taken from his burial programme.\nAs the author of his yet to be published biography, former Chief of General Staff, retired Commodore Okoh Ebitu Ukiwe, asked me to join his delegation to bury a royal father who, along with Ukiwe and others, played leading roles in the creation of today’s Rivers and Bayelsa states between 1993 and 1996.\nWhen the civil war started in 1967 and Biafra lost control of Port Harcourt to the Federal forces, the newly created Rivers State was handed over to the Ijaw. Ijaw leaders continued to maintain that Rivers State, with Port Harcourt as its capital, was created for them as reward for ceding their coastal terrain to the Federal side, thus making the sea blockade of Biafra possible. The Ijaw groups claimed to constitute the majority and continued to dominate the state both during military and civilian dispensations. With time, however, the Igbo speaking people of the state, particularly the Ikwerre nationality, decided they wanted a state of their own where they would be able to assert their own political and economic interests.\nThis was what led to the quest for the creation of Port Harcourt State. However, the Ijaws felt if such a state was created they would become estranged in a city they have been part and parcel of since it was founded by the colonialists. In fact, they had even started portraying Port Harcourt as the capital of a future Ijaw state. Thus was born a great rivalry between the Ijaw-speaking and Igbo-speaking groups for the control of Rivers and between what was termed the “Okrika-Ijaw” and “Ikwerre-Igbo” over the “ownership” of Port Harcourt. The gruesome murder of Dr Obi Wali, the leader of the Ikwerre political front by yet-to-be ascertained assassins in 1992, owed to this tussle, which often led to street battles between Okrikans and Ikwerres.\nMeanwhile, the late father of Nigeria’s nationalism, Dr Nnamdi Azikiwe, had discussed the best strategies for reducing the animosity between the Igbos and their Minority neighbours as well as dousing the ethnic tension between Ikwerres and their riverine co-indigenes of Rivers State. It was agreed that as the touted largest Minority group, the Ijaw needed a state of their own. But with their emotional attachment to Port Harcourt, how would Rivers State be split without creating a permanent ethnic war front in Nigeria’s premier oil city?\nWith the Ijaw groups obviously being favoured by the Northern-led Federal Government, Eze Woluchem, a lawyer who was installed paramount ruler of Port Harcourt in 1977 turned to Dr Azikiwe, appealing for him to support the aspirations of his Igbo kinsmen in the struggle. An ageing “Zik” referred the Eze’s delegation to Commodore Ukiwe, who had become Zik’s close political confidant. The Eze’s delegation of four, which included the late Chief Okogbule Wonodi and Chief Andrew Uchendu, met with Ukiwe in his office in Victoria Island.\nTheir proposal was that Port Harcourt State should only be for Igbo-speaking Rivers people, while the Ijaw-speaking part would be named New Rivers State. On the other hand, the Kalabaris did not want to be parted with Rivers State, neither did the Okrikas, and Ukiwe advised that it would be “unstrategic” to cut out Bonny, Opobo, Kalabari and Okrika, apart from the fact that the Head of State, General Abacha, who was pro-Ijaw, might be pushed not to create any new state at all.\nBetween Ukiwe and the Ikwerre delegation, and taking into account the expressed needs of others, the maps of the present Rivers State and Bayelsa State were drawn and presented to Abacha, who found it acceptable.\nOn October 1, 1996, General Abacha included Bayelsa as one of the six new states approved by the Provisional Ruling Council, PRC. The postulations put together by Ukiwe and the Rebisi’s delegates worked like magic. Today the Ijaws have a state of their own with a capital (Yenagoa) which is being styled the “Jerusalem of the Ijaw Nation”. The Igbo-speaking groups in Rivers State also have a state in which they constitute a comfortable majority and have led since 1999. The issue of “ownership” of Port Harcourt has also been (partially) resolved, as Governor Chibuike Amaechi has retrieved the Crown Lands being claimed by the Ikwerres and Okrikans into government custody.\nIn fact, he has pressed on with the establishment of New Port Harcourt in virgin land within Ikwerre heartland. The ethnic tension is still there somewhat, but it is no longer at the level of street battles and assassinations.\nIndeed, there were “varied positions on the matter”, but all is well that ends well. Rebisi Woluchem has returned to his Creator satisfied that he played a central role in giving his people the ground on which to stand and, along with other stakeholders within the Rivers state, chart a future devoid of rancour but full of promise for fast-tracked development for its many dwellers, both indigenes and non-indigenes.\nLet me note a sour irony of it all. A supposed beneficiary of Eze Woluchem’s struggles, Governor Chibuike Amaechi, was nowhere to be found during the funeral! He was reported to have travelled to the US during the burial. Funny, the Governor was also absent when the king’s wife died a few months before he followed her.\nI gathered that the Governor and the king had not managed to patch up their differences, as Eze Woluchem was solidly behind former Governor Peter Odili when he and Amaechi fought. As soon as he secured his second term of office, Amaechi voluntarily made up with his estranged godfather, Odili.\nUseful lesson: Be careful how you follow a politician into an enmity. You won’t know when they will make up and leave you in the lurch!\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"https://www.vanguardngr.com/2012/04/rebisi-in-history/?amp=1I","2":"1458","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999866486"},{"0":"Time for sports for the inmates\nBy Ikechukwu Nnochiri\nABUJA — Worried by the rising figures of awaiting trial inmates in various prison facilities across the federation, Chief Justice of Nigeria, CJN, Justice Mahmud Mohammed, has asked magistrates to stop imposing stringent bail conditions on accused persons involved in minor offences.\nThe CJN, who gave the directive when the national executives of the Magistrates Association of Nigeria, led by its acting National President, Chief Magistrate Victoria Isiguzo, paid him and 15 other Justices of the Supreme Court a courtesy visit during the weekend, said some magistrates were to be blamed for the level of congestion in the prisons.\nHe said it was regrettable that minor offenders are sometimes ordered to meet harsh and untenable bail terms, even as he stressed that the essence of bail is not to punish an accused person but to secure his attendance to appear in court for trial.\nBesides, the CJN noted that a large number of persons are detained without charge while others are detained pending further investigation.\nHe further decried that people are sometimes detained on the basis of a First Information Report, FIR, which he said upon examination, may operate as holding charge while the prosecutor seeks more evidence to back up his trial.\nMahmud described the practice as unjust, noting that in most of the cases, suspects who are yet to be declared guilty by a competent court, often find themselves incarcerated.\nHe, therefore, called on magistrates to stop indulging the police by admitting to bail a suspect whose case the police are not ready to prosecute.\nAccording to the CJN, “a corollary to this is the imposition of such bail terms which an accused has no real hope of meeting. I wish to use this medium to counsel magistrates to judiciously and carefully exercise their discretion to remand and consider alternatives to detention where possible, and to set reasonable bail terms as appropriate.”\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"http://www.vanguardngr.com/2015/03/prison-congestion-cjn-asks-magistrates-to-liberalise-bail-conditions/#sthash.z2sLFhSR.dpuf","2":"416","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999828339"},{"0":"The Enugu Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi has sacked three of his Commissioners and sworn in two at the State Executive Council meeting.\nThe three Commissioners include Commissioner for Information Dr. Godwin Udeuhele, Commissioner for Youth and Sports Charles Ndukwe and Commissioner for Intel Government Affairs Barrister Smart Ogbe.\nAt the executive hall, Mr. Ogbuagu Anikwe was sworn in as the new Commissioner for Information replacing Godwin Udeughele and Joseph Udedi who took the oath of office as the new commissioner for Youth and Sports replacing Charles Ndukwe.\nThe replacement for the commissioner for Inter-Governmental Affairs is yet unknown.\nBut the state governor in a statement said the changes came as a first step in the move to reshape his cabinet in order to further enhance effective delivery of\ngood governance to the people of Enugu state.","1":"http://www.channelstv.com/2017/07/27/breaking-enugu-govt-sacks-three-commissioners/","2":"185","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9984476566"},{"0":"…As many northern APC members plan to work for him just as PDP northern members voted Buhari in 2015\nBy Charly Agwam, Bauchi; Umar Yusuf, Yola; Marie-Therese Nanlong, Jos; Abdulmumin Murtala, Kano & Haruna Aliyu, Birnin Kebbi\nIn the 2015 general election, a northerner, General Muhammadu Buhari, as the flag bearer of the All Progressives Congress defeated the incumbent, a southerner, Dr Goodluck Jonathan of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP.\nIt was said that Buhari enjoyed the massive support of the northern electorate, including members of the opposition PDP because he was seen as one of them. Many PDP governors were even reported to have worked for Buhari’s emergence as President.\nAt the conclusion of the recent presidential primaries for 2023 election however, the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC, has a southerner, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, as its flag bearer while a northerner, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar emerged as the presidential candidate of the PDP. With Atiku, from the north, as a presidential candidate, the northern voters, expectedly are queuing up behind him irrespective of party affiliation.\nIt is therefore not a surprise to find in Adamawa state, billboards with Atiku’s photograph alongside that of the APC governorship candidate in the state, Senator Aishatu Dahiru Binani and the APC senatorial candidate for Adamawa Central, Malam Abdula’aziz Nyako, as “a winning team”, flooding every nook and cranny of the state.\nMeanwhile, it has been alleged that the group that is sponsoring such posters and billboards in Adamawa state are members of the ruling PDP in the state who are not on the same page with the Ahmadu Fintiri-led government.\nThough the group was regarded as a faceless one, it continued to place such billboards at any available space in the state.\nThe government however claimed it had no idea of such billboards in any part of the state.\nIn Bauchi state, a lot of frontline politicians who hitherto were chieftains of the All Progressives Congress (APC) are now defecting with their followers to People’s Democratic Party (PDP) and New Nigeria People’s Party (NNPP).\nInterestingly, these defections have only benefited political parties whose flag bearers are from the northern part of the country. Although, Bauchi defectors usually give reasons for defecting, it was gathered that they were changing parties to be on the side of the majority which seeks to perpetuate northern presidency beyond 2023.\nSpeaking with Saturday Vanguard, an Electrical Engineer, Abdulraman Aliyu said he would vote a northern presidential candidate under any formidable party.\n“Democracy is a game of number. It is no secret that the North has the number to remain in power for as long as it wants. There’s no need to pretend, my family and I will vote for a candidate from the North. Why will I vote someone else when a northern politician is on the ballot?” he queried.\nThe leader of the National Harmonized Traders Union, Dr Bature Abdulaziz, who is also the founder of Patriotic Elders of Nigeria (PEN) strongly believed that the former vice president Atiku Abubakar, now presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), would enjoy massive support of voters from the north in the coming 2023 general elections.\nIn an interview with Saturday Vanguard in Kano, Dr Abdulaziz however decried the manner both the APC and the PDP conducted their presidential primaries which he described as terrible, saying the defections of members from one party to the other in order to get a platform to contest was a bad omen.\nAccording to him, “It may be possible for some supporters of Atiku to support Tinubu and for some Tinubu’s followers to support Atiku. This is because of the way and manner the primaries were conducted in both the PDP and the APC.\nEveryone saw what happened during the primaries such that people were only interested in getting a platform in which to contest as they moved from one party to the other. There were those who lost the opportunity to become candidates in APC and moved to PDP and vice versa.\nFor this reason, this kind of exodus will also take place as it happened before Buhari emerged. The people in the north on their own will prefer Atiku to Tinubu. But don’t forget that the APC governors in the north have the federal government at the center. The federal government and Tinubu’s supporters will have to double up their efforts.\nA northern elder and PDP chieftain, Abdullahi Muhammed Lamba, argued that the PDP was fair in throwing its presidential ticket open during the primaries as the north was in power for only two years out of the 16 years that the PDP ruled the country while the south enjoyed the remaining 14 years.\nHe argued that the ruling All progressives Congress (APC) has lost its support in the north and can no longer win the hearts of northerners who suffered mentally and financially to bring President Muhammadu Buhari to power.\nLamba contended that “APC’s poor governance was responsible for the insurgency plaguing the north which the masses thought Buhari as a retired army General would contain. But it became worse under him as the north has become a killing field under the APC led government”.\nHe explained that none of the promises made to Nigerians by the APC has been fulfilled, with the economy in comatose and fuel scarcity persisting under the president who is also the minister of petroleum. He said that even the president’s home state of Katsina is being occupied by armed bandits and he watches helplessly as scores are being killed, raped and kidnapped.\nHe declared that, the PDP having learnt its lessons was set to reclaim power in 2023 with Atiku Abubakar.\nIn Plateau State, Ambassador Bagudu Hirse, submitted that “the support enjoyed by Buhari in 2015 was as a result of the security situation in the country as many people argued that if he did not win, the country would not be in peace. But you need to go to the embassies and see how Nigerians are trying to leave the country. The good thing about Atiku is the Muslim/Christian combination, which is the major thing in his favour. Atiku stands a chance of being voted in because the Muslim/Muslim ticket will not work out in the present situation in Nigeria.”\nIn his own opinion, Mr David Racha noted that “the northerners have only one agenda which is their religion. The youths are even less equipped, they have no knowledge of their history and this definitely is not their fault.”\nAnother respondent, Mr. Alex Kwapnoe said, “due to religious bigotry, I see Atiku getting some support from the north. But there will be resistance from Kano, Borno, Yobe, Kaduna, Plateau, Nasarawa, Benue, Kogi, Kwara and Zamfara in an attempt to safeguard their influence in such states.”\nTo Mr Stephen Musa, “Politics, especially in Nigeria is unpredictable. Even though the event in 2015 is different from today, anything can happen. However, I doubt if Atiku will enjoy the same patronage Buhari had. Remember, the APC governors were unanimous in their decision on power shift during the primaries which produced Tinubu.\n“My view is that Atiku may not enjoy the support of some APC governors, but may end up losing the support of his PDP governors if the party fails to resolve the internal crises which emerged after the primaries. The southern governors, and indeed their supporters are not happy with the outcome of the primaries, which produced a Northern candidate. Then there is the issue of the choice of the vice-presidential candidate, which some of the governors, even from the North, are unhappy about. One thing is clear, 2023 will definitely be dicey.”\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"https://www.vanguardngr.com/2022/07/2023-presidency-atiku-may-inherit-buharis-northern-support/","2":"1764","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999675751"},{"0":"GroceryAir FreshenersBeer, Wine & SpiritsBeveragesBreads & BakeryBreakfast FoodsCandy & ChocolateCanned, Jarred & Packaged FoodsCleaning ToolsCondiments & Salad DressingsCooking & BakingDairy, Cheese & EggsDishwashingDrinksFood CupboardHerbs, Spices & SeasoningsHousehold CleaningHousehold SuppliesLaundryLighters & MatchesPaper & PlasticTobacco-Related ProductsGift Items, Hamper Gifts & Party SuppliesNescafe 3-In-1 Breakfast Coffee - 25G X10\nKnorr Beef Bouillon Seasoning Cubes 50X8g Triple Pack\nKnorr Chicken Bouillon Seasoning Cubes 48X8g Triple Pack\nNestle Maggi Cube 20(100 x 4g)\nPepsi Pet 50Cl X12 (Pepsi)\nJameson Irish Whiskey 20cl\nCaptain Morgan Spiced Gold Rum 75cl\nGordon Pink Berry 750ml\nHarpic Toilet Cleaner: Lavender - 450ml\nSmirnoff Intense Chocolate Flavored Vodka 750ml\nGordon Sunset Orange 750ml\nJohnnie Walker Red Label 70cl\nSmirnoff Ice Pineapple Punch 33cl x 24\nSmirnoff Ice Can 330ml x24\n7Up Pet 50cl x12\nJik Bleach (Stain Remover & Germ Killer) - 475ml - Pack Of 3\nCiroc Red Berry Vodka 1L\nSingleton of Dufftown 12 Year Old 70cl\nJohnnie Walker Gold Label 70cl\n5Alive Pulpy Orange Pet 85cl x6\nOrijin Bitters 20cl x24\nBacardi 8 Years Rum 70cl\nTanqueray Ten Dry Gin 70cl\nThe Balvenie Doublewood 12 Years 70cl\nJohnnie Walker Blue Label 70cl\nGood Mama Floral Detergent 1700g + PLATE INSIDE\nDon Royale Dry Gin 75Cl\nMartini Extra Dry Vermouth 100cl\nJohnnie Walker Black Tattoo\nCway Drinking Water 75cl x12\nNestle Activ-Go Sachet N2 NG 10 x 400g\nGuinness Foreign Extra Stout Can 330ml x24\nMartell Cognac Blue Swift 75cl (VSOP)\nKnorr Chicken Bouillon Seasoning Cubes 48X8g\nWilliam Lawson's Finest Blend Whiskey 75cl\nJameson Black Barrel 70cl\nMilo Activ-Go Sachet N2 NG 6 x 800g\nBigi Premium Drinking Water - 750ml x12\nCway Nutri-Milk Apple Flavor 500ml x12\nFanta Drink 50cl Pet x 12\nWelcome to Jumia Nigeria's Premier Online Supermarket Experience!\nGet all you need in one click!\nDiscover the Ultimate Convenience of Jumia Supermarket Shopping At Jumia, we're dedicated to enhancing the quality of your life with a simple click.

The present crises bedeviling the party for quite some time now will not augur well for the nascent democracy.\n“The PDP crisis is a problem not only for the party; it can equally consume the whole nation.”\nResponding, Abubakar said it had become necessary for Nigerians to fight for peace as no meaningful development could be achieved without peace.\nDirecting his supporters in Adamawa State to register en masse with the APC yesterday, Nyako said the opposition has good intentions for the state and the nation at large.\nThe directives came as PDP flags were being removed from public institutions across the state.\nNyako gave the directives yesterday at a meeting of stake-holders of APC and the nPDP at the Government House, Yola.\nThe governor said that PDP had betrayed the people of Adamawa in spite of all they did in ensuring PDP victories at all levels in the last general elections.\nHe described the plight of the people of Adamawa under PDP as that of Israelites under Pharaoh, necessitating their mass exodus.\nThe governor debunked insinuations that he was working for his son’s political ambition, saying his son will not contest any election in 2015.\nNyako said: “My son will not contest any election in 2015. What we are doing is for peace, progress and unity of the state and the nation in general.\n“The way PDP is operating in Adamawa is inimical to peace and unity of the state.\n“APC offered better opportu-nity with level playing field for everyone. There is no new comer or old member in APC, so go and mobilise your people to join the popular movement.”\nPDP Reps to mediate\nApparently disturbed by the development, PDP Reps, yesterday, agreed in a meeting to interface with President Goodluck Jonathan on the way forward, next week.\nIn a closed-door meeting held at the Reps’ wing of the National Assembly complex, they expressed disappointment in the manner the crisis was being handled and agreed that all the members would meet with Mr. President and bare their minds.\nThe meeting, which was chaired by the Deputy Speaker, Emeka Ihedioha, resolved to work as one large family and look issues dispassionately.\nA front line member, who attended the meeting told Vanguard that “we have decided to work together as one.”\nAsked whether it was both the PDP and nPDP Reps that met, he said, “Yes. We all met and there was no division of any sort. We met as one body.\n“We are going to see Mr. President and tell him how we feel and how we intend to serve our fatherland without involving our members in whatever is happening outside the House.”\nAnother source said: “Those who are parading themselves as our representatives at the Presidential Villa are not selfless people. We have agreed to deal with Mr. President collectively.\n…rule out House\nMeanwhile, the House said yesterday that despite the defection of five nPDP govern-ors, nothing will change in its leadership as no member has so far communicated to the leader-ship of his intention to move.\nDeputy spokesman of the House, Mr. Victor Ogene (APGA, Anambra), said until such a time when members formally declare their intention, the House remains the way it is.\nHe said Section 68 (1) of the 1999 Constitution, as amended, provides that members can only defect to another political party in group base on merger agreement, but that what was happening in PDP cannot be defined as such.\nHe said: “In politics, things like this happen. But as a House, we remain one. Section 68 (1) (g) of the 1999 Constitution, as amended, says people cannot cross carpet in group except in merger situation.\n“But defection has to do with individual member. So if they’re defecting, the proper thing must be done by activating that section of the constitution.\n“As at now, we are not aware of any member defecting to another party. Remember, going by our rule, until a party has 181 members, you can’t talk of having the majority.”\nAlso yesterday, Oyinlola said that his expulsion from the party as recommended to the party’s NWC by Alhaji Umaru Dikko-led Disciplinary Committee would not stand.\nIn a statement by his Principal Secretary, Femi Adelegan, Oyinlola, who noted that democracy was on trial, said: “The recommendations of the committee will not stand, as nobody can build something on nothing; and falsehood on truth.\n“The committee does not exist because its composition was not ratified by the National Executive Committee of PDP, which is statutorily empowered to approve the composition of the body.\n“They really worked with great speed in their feverish ambition of getting rid of Oyinlola before the hearing of his suit at an Abuja Federal High Court, challenging the validity of illegalities.\n“No sane or decent person would be surprised at the recommendations of the illegally constituted Disciplinary Committee, which from the outset shouldered a heavy burden of legitimacy, integrity, lack of respect for fair play, principles of natural justice and the Rule of Law.”\nCross carpeting of disloyal elements, not merger— PDP\nThe national leadership of PDP, yesterday, took a swipe at the five governors and some members who defected to the APC, saying it was not a merger, but an opportunistic cross carpeting of disloyal elements, reiterating that as a party it would not lose sleep over the action.\nIn a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Chief Olisa Metuh, PDP said a tree that is pruned blossoms the more.\nIt added that there was no way the fusion of Alhaji Abubakar Kawu Baraje-led splinter group of PDP into APC could be described as merger because the group was never a party, adding that the Bamanga Tukur-led NWC stands as the only PDP known to law.\nMetuh said: “Our attention has been drawn to press reports and statements from some persons passing off the cross carpeting of a group of former PDP members to APC as a merger.\n“This information is false and is intended to mislead the public. What happened was not a merger. You can only talk of a merger where there were two distinct parties.\n“In this case, there is only one party, APC. The so-called nPDP was never a party. This was established on October 10, when a Lagos High Court gave judgment against then PDP and on October 11, when the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, wrote the nPDP to say that the Alhaji Bamanga Tukur-led PDP is the only recognised party by that name.”\nA sad devt— Anenih\nMeanwhile, Chairman of PDP Board of Trustees, BoT, Chief Tony Anenih, yesterday, described the move of the five governors as sad and urged members of the party not to be moved or disturbed by it.\nChief Anenih expressed satisfaction that the party leadership, President Jonathan, former president Olusegun Obasanjo and Ibrahim Babangida, former National Chairmen, Barnabas Gemade and Ahmadu Ali as well as himself “invested enough energy, commitment, maturity and sincerity in the collective effort at reconciliation.\n“I had expected the governors to stay on in the party, which has offered them a unique opportunity to serve their people.\n“Surprisingly, they decided to abandon their home and platform to take up tenancy in an opposition party even when it was apparent that the effort of Mr. President for genuine reconciliation was enough for them to see good reason to show restraint and understanding.

Excerpts\nWhen the election of Orji Uzor Kalu was annulled at the tribunal, what was your reaction?\nWhen the election was announced, I knew that the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) candidate Mao Ohuabunwa will go to court. I was in the collation room during the election, I spoke with him and I knew he was heading to court. After the March election, I have not spoken with Orji Kalu and have not been to Abuja. But I knew that a court process is on and anything can happen. However, that does not remove the fact that the APC in Abia north is strong. We knew there will be a court ruling; we knew we have a legitimate victory that will stand the test of all the challenges. At the end of it, the APC will triumph because we were in the field and we can tell you what happened in the field. If at the appeal court and we still have to go for a re-run, Kalu will trash Ohuabunwa even with wider margin.\nWhat gives you that confidence?\nWhat gives me confidence is that before the election, we were having trouble in the camp of Orji Uzor Kalu. We had trouble in some of the local governments that formed Abia North. Abia North has five local governments. They are Umunneochi, Isikwuato, Bende, Ohafia and Arochukwu. During election Orji will have Bende, Ohafia and Arochukwu LGAs. But Isikwuato and Umuneochi often be a battle ground. But this time around it was different. In Isikwuato, for instance we have the Minister of State, Mine and Steel Development Uchechukwu Ogar well prepared to deliver for the APC. I believe a million times over the people will support the APC. At Umuneochi, the APC will lead comfortably because we have politically influential people there. Orji with his strength and popularity will get hold of the place. Coming down to Bende, the place of Kalu, he always rules in the area like a colossus. In Ohafia, where I come from and many others, we will deliver to the APC and that is a fact. At Arochukwu, Kalu had never lost any election in the area, so we don’t have any fear, should there be a re-run. That is the basis of my confidence and if there is a re-run ten times over Orji will still win the election. If at the Appeal the court upturns the judgment of the tribunal fine. But if is otherwise, I want to say Kalu will win Abia North any time any day. He can even stand as an independent candidate in any election and win. He is a cult hero in Abia North and there is nobody to contest it with him.\nSome people have raised concern that Abia government is not living up to expectation. Are you worried?\nI have met governor Ikpeazu several times and in our meetings I have been very opened to him. I have always told him that this is an opportunity to stamp his legs on the sands of time. The Ngwa nation or clan has been clamouring for an opportunity to produce the governor of Abia State. He is the lucky one that has occupied the position. If he allows the eight years to go and there is nothing to write about him, then history will adjudge him bad. Ikpeazu should put his house together and make sure he delivers good governance in Abia and that is our prayer. Let him use his tongue to count his teeth, whether he is doing well or not. Like they say, the taste of the food is in the eating. The people of Abia State that I meet are not happy with the performance of government. So, I will just advise him to use the chance he has to justify the clamour of the Ngwa people.\nThe government owed its workers close to one year salaries now…\nI am an employer of labour, I know how painful it is if you don’t pay your workers. The biggest problem of some of the people in government is mediocrity. We have people who are not properly nurtured in the art of leadership and they are in very high position. I think it is evil for someone to work for you for 30 days and you refuse to pay that person. How do you expect that person to feed his family? I don’t see a governor that will sleep well, if he refuses to pay salary.\nDo you think the APC can make things better, if they have the chance in 2023?\nWe are not happy that the governor is not paying salaries; there are many issues in Abia that one could campaign about including prompt payment of salaries. If the government is not paying salaries, it is an act of evil punishable by God and it is not proper. So, every pressure on PDP in Abia is an opportunity for us in the APC to produce the next governor.\nIs the Southeast prepared for the Presidency?\nThe Presidency is still a long way to go. But the race to occupy the position of the President started immediately after the last election. The emergence of President Muhammadu Buhari and former Vice President Atiku Abubakar will define the way in 2023. But being that as it may, I believe at the moment, the Southeast is not politically strong enough to produce the President in 2023. And that is my honest disposition. Some people may criticize this, saying what is this Ibo man saying? But as a politician and someone that has come of age, I know that we need a strong political party structure and national outreach. You need other factors like finance and others to get to that exalted office. You need enough handshakes across the regions. The Yoruba are better positioned than the Igbo. If you look at the government of today, I will say the Yoruba are controlling more than 40 per cent in the structure of governance, where you have a Vice President that is from the Southwest. You have a speaker of the House of Representatives that is from the Southwest. Out of the four high offices, they have two from the same zone. Even the north does not have it that way because the President is from the Northwest and the Senate President is from Northeast. In the north, the portfolio is divided among the zones in the north. In the south, a lot of power is concentrated in the Southwest because of the judgment of my political party the APC. Simply, what you give is what you get. That is if you give much, you will also get much in return. That is what the Southwest is enjoying. Now, how do you place the Southeast in this calculation? They are nowhere to be found. The highest position the Southeast is occupying, is at the National Assembly. That is the Chief whip, a party position and not a national position. The Chief Whip of the Senate represents mainly the APC senators. It does not have overwhelming control of the PDP senators. The occupant can only negotiate, so the Southeast is nowhere to be found in this equation at the moment. So, for the Southeast to jump the bottle neck, to emerge in 2023, it will be difficult. The PDP can still rely on the north. They know that if they break from the north and give the Presidential candidate to another zone, PDP will problem. So in 2023, PDP will still go back to zoning its Presidential candidate to the north. But for the APC, the fight is between the North and the Southwest for the President.\nWhat is your view on the present cabinet of Buhari?\nI do not have confidence in the present composition. And when I compare that of Lagos State to the Federal Government I think, Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu is better. There is no gap in Lagos cabinet. You can see technocrats and when you put this side by side with the Federal Government, the federal cabinet is like a compensatory cabinet. People who can make things happen are not fully involved. This is why I say I do not expect much from the Federal Government.","1":"https://thenationonlineng.net/southeast-not-ready-for-2023-2/","2":"1775","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999771118"},{"0":"The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) says it will freeze accounts without a Bank Verification Number (BVN) or National Identification Number (NIN) from April 2024.\nThis is according to a Friday circular by the apex bank which instructed banks to place a “Post no Debit” restriction – which prevents customers from making withdrawals, transfers, or any other debits “for all existing Tier-1 accounts/wallets without BVN or NIN”.\n“Effective immediately, any unfunded account/wallet shall be placed on ‘Post No Debit or Credit’ until the new process is satisfied.

Buhari’s genocide marks the culmination of a long train of Biafran subjugation by radical Hausa-Fulani Islamic terrorists. The dictator’s power is anchored to an illegitimate constitution decreed by a military dictator in 1999 to hold the Christian Biafran people in bondage to Hausa-Fulani Muslims. Nigeria’s constitution has never been approved by Nigerians.\nLast June, Buhari tacitly endorsed a Hausa-Fulani threat to expel by force and violence and to plunder 11 million Igbos in twelve northern Nigerian states that have adopted Sharia as their legal codes if they did not abandon their Igbo homes and businesses by October 1, 2017. During the past few years in northern Nigeria, Hausa-Fulani terrorists have destroyed thousands of churches and religious schools and displaced millions of Christian Biafrans.\nHundreds of innocent civilians have died and more have been injured or terrorized by Nigeria’s military acting under Buhari’s direction in the last week alone. A courageous and influential Biafran leader, Nnamdi Kanu, has had his home attacked and quarantined by Nigeria’s armed forces and his followers killed. Grisly videos and photos taken at scenes of the harrowing crimes are conclusive. What they prove amounts to state terrorism—the systematic employment of violence to intimidate or coerce a civilian population.\nInstead of providing Buhari a megaphone, the United Nations should be expelling Nigeria from membership under Article 6 of the United Nations Charter. The United Nations Security Council (UNSC) should be referring the dictator and his henchmen like Army Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Tukur Yusuf Buratai to the Chief Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, Fatou Bensouda, to investigate for complicity in genocide. The UNSC should also be imposing an arms embargo on Nigeria under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter until the right of the Biafran people to self-determination is secured through a free and fair referendum conducted by the United Nations Electoral Unit. At present, dictator Buhari is diverting arms purchased for ostensible use against Boko Haram, an international terrorist organization, to the terrorizing of Biafran Christians. Buhari has no interest in defeating Boko Haram because its threat triggers military and financial assistance from the United States in its global war on terrorism.\nThese sanctions against Nigeria would honor twin objectives of the United Nations: (1) “to establish conditions under which justice and respect for the obligations arising from treaties and other sources of international law can be maintained;” and, (2) “promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to…religion.”\nThe genocide of Biafrans is not a “domestic” matter within the exclusive jurisdiction of Nigeria. Genocide is a crime against all of mankind which concerns every country. Moreover, if dictator Buhari is permitted to kill and enslave Christian Biafrans with impunity, Nigeria could degenerate into a Hausa-Fulani Islamic theocracy and could become a state sponsor of terrorism. Nigeria’s example would embolden the persecution of Christians elsewhere.\nNigeria’s 190 million inhabitants make it the most populous nation in Africa. It is a model not only in West Africa but throughout the continent. It is too important for its fate to be left to the roll of the dice.\nThe international community planted the seeds of contemporary Nigerian and African strife by arbitrarily carving up the continent in favor of colonial powers at the 1884-85 Berlin Conference. The United Nations is saddled with a moral obligation to help remedy the dystopias spawned by many of its key members.\nWhile the suffering and persecution of Burma’s Muslim Rohingya have captured headlines and the attention of the U.N. High Commissioner on Human Rights, Zeid Ra’ad al-Hussein, Nigeria’s far worse oppression of Biafrans has been largely ignored. It is difficult to resist the conclusion that international human rights community squints when blacks kill blacks.\nPlease read our comment policy before commenting.","1":"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/sep/20/un-nigeria-stance-biafrans/","2":"951","3":"Politics","4":"2","5":"en","6":"0.999756813"},{"0":"THE 1967-70 Nigeria Civil War, for the Igbo was a battle of historic survival against the forces of national darkness that roamed in the form of periodic unrestrained anti-Igbo riots and massacres, and subsequently the chilling pogrom of 1969.\nIt was not only a battle for survival but for the upholding of the Igbo man’s dignity, which, as previously feared got swallowed up by the events of the civil war. Those who supported Biafra did so not because of the capability of the Igbo to win the war against the World Powers-supported Federal might but for the case of conscience.\nThe likes of Presidents Houphouet-Boigny of Cote d’Voire, Julius Nyerere of Tanzania, Kenneth Kaunda of Zambia, Omar Bongo of Gabon, Papa Doc of Haiti and to some extent Siaka Stevens of Sierra Leone, Jomo Kenyata of Kenya, William Tolbert of Liberia, and the French Government of the time did so out of conscience against the forces of darkness that ruled Nigeria at that time. This explains why, even at the final defeat of the Igbo they never abandoned their vanquished friends-turned brothers. Today there are sprawling Igbo populations in these countries with many of them not only becoming full citizens of their host countries, but even playing very important Government roles.\nAs the Igbo would often say, “no land exists without the presence of the lizard”. So it has become customary to say that no battle takes place without the active roles of saboteurs. The Nigeria civil war, like any such war of its kind no doubt witnessed a number of Igbo citizens playing the Vidkun Quisling role against their own people, sabotaging the survivalist sacrificial efforts of their down-trodden people by supporting the Federal troops, prophesying the doomsday for their people’s struggle for survival.\nThese people not only celebrated the defeat of their own people but shamelessly rushed to seek Federal Government appointments and contracts while those who sacrificed, endured and survived remained in perpetual penury for decades and for life.\nToday, Reverend Ejike Mbaka in the event of General Muhammadu Buhari’s victory presents himself as a champion of God’s prophecy, just because he vaingloriously assumed that his words are the words of God verbatim. But there remain certain clear indices to determine if an event is truly the act of God in the manner a visioner or soothsayer presented it. We know that Ejike Mbaka is from Awgu district in Enugu State and it is not disputable that his people of Enugu State overwhelmingly voted for President Goodluck Jonathan. Secondly, Mbaka should let us know if the massive failure of the Jega’s rigging machine miscalled Card-readers was the act of God. Thirdly, let Father Mbaka tell Nigerians how the God he worships approved the fraudulent permission of under-aged children to vote in the northern part of the country.\nFor we all know that the God of the Roman Catholic Church of which Reverend Father Mbaka belongs is a just God who hates cheating in whatever form it is presented. Unless Reverend Mbaka is telling us that he has another God other than the one Almighty God we all know and acknowledged.Yes, if the victors said the defeat of Biafra was the act of God, the Igbo could not have denied such a statement, just as the on-going victory of the blood-sucking Islamic State in Syria and the Levante (ISIS/ISIL) and their budding children in Nigeria called Boko Haram could also be attributed to the act of God. Those who truly worship God in truth and spirit through any form or medium truly know that God’s ways are hard to fully predict by mortal man.\nFor whatever it was worth, the massive Igbo support for President Jonathan was a patriotic call to duty. Yes, President Jonathan might not have met the greater part of our expectations from him as the President and Commander-in-Chief of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. But for the Igbo, he wiped out the ignominious tears of second-fiddlers in Federal Government affairs. For the first time since the end of the Nigeria civil war, the Igbo occupied in one stroke the positions of Secretary of the Government of the Federation, two Chiefs of Staff of the Armed Forces at the same time – the Army and Navy.\nAt least the second Niger Bridge is presently under construction. Beyond these, the massive Igbo support for the President was a cementing force that eventually obliterated the political cancer of rivalry and mutual mistrust between the Igbo and their South-South ethnic brothers that began with Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe and Professor Eyo Ita in the 1950s. Today, the contentious State creation agitation by these neighbours of the Igbo from the defunct Igbo-dominated Eastern Region has been resolved with the existing multiplicity of States.\nThe civil war has come and gone. But could we say that the reason for which the Igbo took up the arms of defence against the Federal Government no longer exists? The Niger Delta militants took up arms against the Federal Government in defence of their rights and have through that experience chiefly identified who their friends and foes are. Have the Igbo actually identified who their friends and foes are in the matrix of present politics?\nThe historical experience of any people so oppressed like the Igbo, no matter how checkered it might be, fundamentally calls for reflection and in essence a lesson. The emergence of General Muhammadu Buhari as the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria most importantly calls for reflection primarily for the Igbo. It is a matter that evidently put the Igbo on the balance of sustained political principle via-a-vis a taciturn principle of progressive opposition or wobbling edifice of political harlotry.\nThe present balance of political equation beckons on true Igbo patriots to stand firm and hold the bull of politics by its horn of emerging political challenges. The greatest political disaster the Igbo will attract on themselves is for the crop of her political leaders to aimlessly drift to the soon to emerge ruling APC in the name of being afraid to be in opposition. What is most important for the present political terrain is for both the South East and South-South to further cement the political gains of common solidarity for Jonathan by building a strong force of opposition.\nWhat has become customary in the acquisition of political power in Nigeria today, except for the Igbo, is that ethnic generated conflicts often end in Presidential compensation.\nPresident Olusegun Obasanjo reaped from the blood-watering conflict of June 12 presidential election annulment. President Umar Yar’Adua benefited from the dastard incarceration and eventual death of his senior brother in the hands of General Sani Abacha.\nPresident Goodluck Jonathan invariably reaped from the Niger Delta struggles for economic emancipation. And now, can one deny the fact that General Muhammadu Buhari evidently reaped from the on-going Boko Haram insurgency? What did the Igbo reap from the 30-month long civil war? The Igbo had since the end of the civil war engaged in competitive licking of the political ass of most past Federal Governments except in fact that of President Jonathan. Will this be the case with President Muhammadu Buhari?\nDr. Tony Nwaezeigwe is an acting director , Centre for Igbo Studies, University of Nigeria, Nsukka.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"http://www.vanguardngr.com/2015/04/igbo-and-the-fallacy-of-mbakas-gods-vindication/#sthash.zJeDQ5l1.dpufJust","2":"1571","3":"Politics","4":"2","5":"en","6":"0.9994584322"},{"0":"Senator Ike Ekweremadu\nBy Henry Umoru & Joseph Erunke\nABUJA— DEPUTY President of the Senate, Senator Ike Ekweremadu, weekend, said former President Goodluck Jonathan frustrated efforts to separate office of the Attorney-General of the Federation from that of Minister of Justice by refusing to assent to the amendment that would have brought it about.\nAccording to him, it is necessary to separate both offices, if Nigerians still desire that justice delivery must be strengthened in the country.\nEkweremadu, who disclosed this to journalists during a tour of the construction site of national headquarters of Nigeria Bar Association, NBA, Abuja, said the proposal to separate the two offices actually sailed through during the last amendment, but did not see the light of the day because the Forth Alteration Bill containing it was not assented to by Jonathan.\nHe explained that the separation of the two offices would make whoever was appointed the AGF to work for the people and not necessarily the government in power as a cabinet minister, saying that would ensure access to justice by citizens, devoid of any external influence.\nWhen separated, AGF will work for the people\nEkweremadu said: “I believe in the separation of the two offices. I go for it any time, any day. This is because it will guarantee financial independence, security of tenure, and make the holder of the office of the Attorney-General at the state and federal levels to be autonomous in thinking and approach to the idea of justice.\n“It will ensure that citizens have access to justice, since the officer will not be dictated to by any external interest or influence.\n“During the last constitution amendment, we (members of the Senate Committee on the Review of the 1999 Constitution in the 7th National Assembly) recommended it to our colleagues, based on inputs from Nigerians, and they graciously adopted it.\n“Unfortunately, the last President did not sign it. Although, we will be looking at all the issues again, the decision on the separation, or any other issue for that matter, will depend on what other colleagues and Nigerians would think. But as a person, I strongly believe in it.”\nIt would be recalled that the National Conference Standing Committee on Law, Judiciary and Human Rights had in April 2014 during the National Conference, adopted a recommendation for the separation of the office of Minister of Justice and Attorney-General of the Federation.\nDeputy Chairman of the committee, Prof Auwalu Yadudu, who made this known then, had said the recommendation was to ensure the independence of the office of the Attorney-General from political influence.\nAccording to him, the two offices should not be occupied by an individual in order to ensure justice.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"http://www.vanguardngr.com/2016/07/jonathan-frustrated-move-separate-agfs-office-justice-ministers-ekweremadu/","2":"587","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999980927"},{"0":"A photo shows a campaign signboad displayed by the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) to show its readiness to defeat Boko Haram Islamists on assumption office at Ogijo, Ogun State in southwest Nigeria, on July 3, 2015.

The 1970 240Z set the stage for the brand's success throughout the decade, the 1990 300ZX showed the impressive engineering acumen Nissan would be known for in the '90s, and the 2003 350Z ushered in a renaissance as Carlos Ghosn and his Renault-Nissan Alliance brought the company back from the brink. The current 370Z has withered, along with its parent company, over the past decade, leaving many to wonder if the Z had a future at all in the wake of Ghosn's scandalous departure and the company's financial struggles. The Z Proto, a production-intent preview for the upcoming Z35-generation 400Z, appears to answer that question with a resounding yes.\nFive inches longer than the 370Z, the new car has an elegant shape. We see hints of Jaguar and Aston Martin in its proportions, but Nissan head of design Alfonso Albaisa is focused on how it evokes prior iterations of the Z. \"We don't use the word retro, it's more of an homage,\" said Albaisa.\nThe new car's detailing is somewhat of a grab bag of the best of past Z-cars, with 240Z-inspired headlights, 300ZX-esque taillights, and a few other historical touches. The only real nod to the past inside, though, is the three-gauge binnacle atop the dash; it's otherwise a fully modernized two-seat cockpit with large display screens for the gauge cluster and infotainment system and an attractive new steering-wheel design.\nUnder the long hood is a twin-turbo 3.0-liter V-6, which GT-R guru and chief product specialist Hiroshi Tamura says is a modified version of the VR30DDTT unit available in both 300- and 400-hp states of tune in the Infiniti Q50 and Q60. The 400Z should hew closer to the high end of that scale, although Nissan might leave room for a NISMO version. A six-speed manual is standard, and an automatic will be optional, likely the seven-speed torque-converter unit found in the Infinitis.\nNissan isn't discussing the chassis, leaving us to assume that it rides on the same rear-wheel-drive FM platform as before. It'll likely share suspension and brake components with the Infiniti Red Sport performance models. \"The Z must have a strong connection between human and machine, like a dance partner,\" Tamura said, noting how the emotional aspects—driving feel, sound, and styling—are more important than objective performance here. We hope that's not an excuse for uncompetitive numbers, but Nissan is well aware of the other turbocharged 3.0-liter sports car coming out of Japan these days (well, by way of a BMW factory in Austria), the Toyota Supra.\nAs they were in the 1990s, the Z and Supra will be close rivals. The Nissan's manual transmission is an advantage over the automatic-only Toyota (for now), but the Z will have its work cut out for it matching the 382-hp Supra's zero-to-60-mph time of 3.8 seconds. Nissan hasn't made any performance claims yet, other than hinting that the automatic will be quicker than the manual.\nGiven its new engine and revamped design, we think the new Z will leap in price over the current car, which starts at $31,085. When the 400Z production car arrives sometime in 2021, we expect it will start in the mid-$40,000 range, neatly bisecting the four- and six-cylinder Supra models. And we hope it will be worth the wait.\nDespite being raised on a steady diet of base-model Hondas and Toyotas—or perhaps because of it—Joey Capparella nonetheless cultivated an obsession for the automotive industry throughout his childhood in Nashville, Tennessee. He found a way to write about cars for the school newspaper during his college years at Rice University, which eventually led him to move to Ann Arbor, Michigan, for his first professional auto-writing gig at Automobile Magazine.

Limited and Linda Manufacturing Company.\nThose on the verge of shutting down include Unilever, PZ Industries, and Prime Pack.\nOne of the companies about to shut operations in Nigeria is Kimberly-Clark because of high energy costs, expensive raw materials, and reduced customer demand.\nThe company, it was gathered, has reduced shifts and implemented other cost-cutting measures in a bid to remain afloat.\nThe company’s $100 million factory, located in Ikorodu, Lagos State, was commissioned two years ago by former Vice President Yemi Osinbajo to produce diapers and sanitary pads, among others.\nLamenting the plight of the sector, Executive Secretary of CANMPEF, Mr Olorunfemi Oke, said the exits were painful, saying more worrying is the fact that challenges faced in the sector were inflicted by government policies.\nAccording to him, the challenges confronting the sector are floating of the naira, depreciating currency and volatile exchange rate, fuel subsidy removal, high exchange rate for computation of import duty, high interest rate, epileptic power supply with the recent increase in tariff that has tripled electricity bills and made it unsustainable for businesses; and inadequate gas supply for firms, and high cost of diesel.\nHe also named poor road conditions, multiple taxations, a high inflation rate of over 34 per cent, weak consumer purchasing power, and insecurity across the country.\nThe executive secretary said: “The effects of the socio-economic challenges on the manufacturing companies are enormous. Most of our member companies are just managing to survive. We cannot access forex for purchase of raw materials and machinery.\n“High import duty cost is discouraging importation of raw materials and machinery. High energy costs have resulted in high production costs. Unreliable power and gas supply disrupts production schedules and increases operation costs.\n“We are experiencing high reduction in capacity utilization and increased production slowdowns, huge foreign exchange losses suffered by many member companies, especially the multinationals, and reduction of profit. Majority are recording losses.\n“There is also declining market share and growth potential and inability to compete with imported products. High interest rates discourages business expansion. There is growing weakness in consumer purchasing power. Companies are shutting down some of their operations. This has led to retrenchment of employees. The hyperinflation has led to an increase in the cost of living of employees and an adversarial industrial relations climate in the sector.\n“While I don’t want to sound alarmist, tens of member companies from the multinationals, medium and small scale companies have shut down. Some of the companies that have closed down are Glaxo SmithKline Beecham, Procter & Gamble, Mega Plastic Nig Limited, Twinstar Nig Limited, Femina Hygienical Products Nig Limited, and Linda Manufacturing Company. Similarly, among those on the verge of shutting down include Unilever and PZ industries.\n‘’We are very pained by these developments. Let us take for example the case of Linda Manufacturing Company and Kimberly-Clark.\nLinda Manufacturing Company which was producing synthetic hair attachments and other accessories was employing and keeping our young girls off the streets and criminality. Only God knows what these young girls will turn to now that they are out of jobs. And for Kimberley Clark which produces Huggies diapers, and sanitary pads, with the imminent shutdown of its Ikorodu production facility two years after investing $100 million in Nigeria. Remember that the former Vice President, Yemi Osibanjo commissioned the factory two years ago.\nThe company has been producing below-installed capacity since late 2023 because of the harsh economic environment in the country. If this company is allowed to exit Nigeria, it will add to the sad story of the worsening crisis in our sector. The pathetic situation of this firm is that in 2022, the company commissioned a $100 million production factory in Ikorodu, Lagos State which was inaugurated by then vice president to resume operations after an earlier closure of operations in 2019 following a review of its business. Apart from these woes, 80 per cent of the remaining member companies are operating at low-capacity utilization.\nWhile Mr Oke was not forthcoming on the number of job losses, Vanguard, however, gathered that no fewer than 100,000 Nigerians have lost their jobs in the sector.\nSpeaking further, he said: “As a Nigerian, it is sad and frustrating for me to talk about my fellow countrymen and women losing their means of livelihood in this manner.\n‘’A lot of people have been thrown into the job market. The figure is huge. We are talking about direct and indirect employment, comprising suppliers, distributors, drivers, contractors, and traders among others. I do not want to give a figure. But I can tell you without mincing words that it is huge.”\nThe CANMPEF scribe called on government to address challenges facing the sector by “giving concessions on the allocation of forex to the manufacturing companies, reduction of import duties for raw materials for an essential sector like the pharmaceutical industry, reduction in import duty charges, improving supply of energy and gas to manufacturers, reduction of the rate of energy charges by power distribution companies, DISCOs, stopping multiple taxes by the local, states and federal government agencies, signing and implementing the new national minimum wage bill to improve consumers’ purchasing power, focusing on rehabilitating selected roads to reduce logistics costs and fixing the nation’s refineries to enable access to petroleum bi-products that serves as raw materials for the chemical industries.\n“The industry is import- dependent because of the nature of its products and its raw materials are chemicals majorly from the petro- chemical industries. ‘’The Federal Government should take urgent action to stop manufacturing companies from shutting down.\nGovernment should support the companies to thrive and increase employment and reduce insecurity challenges in the country.\n“The only member companies that seem to be doing well today are the cement manufacturing firms because of road constructions and other related businesses.”\nVoda Paint MD reacts\nAlso speaking, the Managing Director, Voda Paints Limited, Mr Rotimi Aluko, blamed unreliable power, unstable currency, difficulty doing business, steadily rising inflation, insecurity, multiple taxation, and poor infrastructure, among others.\nAluko, who is also the Vice President of CANMPEF, said: “Like most of the sectors making up the Nigerian industrial landscape, the chemical, leather, food sectors are all struggling to survive economic hardship that, looking back now, has actually been long coming.\n‘’It is, indeed, very hard to find any one sector of the economy that is not impacted by the numerous issues which those doing business in Nigeria have really been enduring, starting with unreliable power, unstable currency, difficulty doing business, steadily rising inflation, insecurity, multiple taxation, poor infrastructure, etc.\n“Currency tweaking and the associated policies in concert with the removal of petrol subsidy and the floating of the naira, have helped to compound the pressure on industrial operations generally.\n“The consequence on the consumers is depletion of disposable income, such that most households are in tight adjustment as their income is hardly coping with necessities.\n“Most industries rely on bountiful discretionary income to survive. That is the crux of the pain in the sector. Demand has significantly dropped and so goes production and ultimately income.\n“It is, indeed, very tough, especially for sectors outside of households’ eessential or committed expenses.\n‘’Even those in essential expenses column are grappling with the consequences of reduced demand, owing to downward adjustments by consumers of quantities and quality of their purchases as a result of inflation-driven loss of purchasing power.\n“I think how the sectors have been coping can easily be deduced from all the aforesaid; we are in survival mode. Sacrifice, cost-cutting as much as feasible, mounting bills, income stagnation, abandonment of key projects, reduced hours of operation/attendance rotation, etc. Everyone is scratching the ground as well as their heads for whatever will aid to keep them afloat.\nOn ways out of the challenges, Aluko said: “Government action. It is all down to what the government chooses to do and not do. The truth starts with how the government views and treats manufacturing. If manufacturing is taken as the most strategic value-adding local content economic weapon that it is, Nigeria will transform into the league of leading nations of the world!\n“Not even crude oil can come close. Why? It is manufacturing that can harness our immense reservoir of human talents to serve as an engine for the conversion of the bountiful contents atop and beneath our God-given land and those beyond our shores into products capable of becoming the biggest foreign exchange earners as experienced by China and several other Asian economies.\n“Government just has to step forward to help get the necessary building blocks in place and put right the business environment, such that Nigeria will rank high among nations having very attractive level of ease of doing business.\n“For this to be, the government has to make these investments and protect local manufacturing. This is non-negotiable. All advanced nations and those who have climbed up to join the top league did it at one point or another and are still doing it.\n“The most powerful economic and military power in the world is currently engaged with China openly as an example.\n“We have done it before with huge success when in 2007, Nigeria clamped down on the importation of cement by companies without local cement manufacturing investment. The result is huge.\n“Before the implementation of the smart act of protection, Nigeria in 48 years of cement manufacturing preceding the protective action, only grew to about seven million metric tonnes of cement production per annum and in the 15 years succeeding the policy, has grown to over 60 million metric tonnes production/per annum.\n“Do that across several sectors integrating farm produce conversion, petrochemicals, basic chemicals, natural resources, basic tools, electronics, etc, Nigeria will be an unstoppable giant. It has potentials.\n“The government should declare a clear form of emergency in the manufacturing sector. It should subsidise consumption via manufacturing subsidy by way of tax relief, duty/tariff removal on agricultural and manufacturing inputs. The gains will come in many folds.\n“First of all, our youths will be gainfully employed and stop idling away their lives or hawking things they should be producing in the first instance. Savings on social and security costs cannot be estimated.\n“Government should put in place necessary administrative and legal firewalls against those who might truncate gains of the strive towards the achievement of good level ease of doing business across the country and sectors.”\nLabour begs FG to intervene\nOn his part, the National Secretary, National Union of Chemical Footwear Rubber Leather and Non-Metallic Products Employees, NUCFRLANMPE, Joseph Dada, pleaded with the government to intervene immediately to save the sector from imminent collapse. He said: “Our industrial sector has been finding it extremely difficult to operate smoothly and effectively for the past two years.\n‘’Bad government policies have negatively affected the running of our sector. Many of the industries have relocated to other African countries where they can do their business with ease and maximise profit.\n“Our government, through the Central Bank, has increased the lending rate to over 30 per cent, which is not good for manufacturing and chemical industries to break even as most raw materials are imported. We cannot do backward integration.\n“The industries are groaning under the outrageous tariffs imposed by DISCOs and others responsible for the supply and distribution of electricity to the industries in Nigeria.\nThe tariffs are doing nothing other than kill the industries. This is compounded by the removal of the petrol subsidy that has turned the country upside down since last year. The consequences are part of the socio-economic distortions plaguing the nation.\n“Some of the companies that have relocated to other African countries are multinationals, such as Procter & Gamble and GSK Pharma, Femina Hygiene, and Twinstar. Many others are on the verge of closing down any moment from now because of the unfavourable economic policies of our government.\n“Hundreds of workers have lost their jobs as a result of management’s inability to provide raw materials in their various companies. Those that are managing to produce are producing below 20 to 25 per cent of installed capacities.\n‘’We are still compiling the list of job losses.

It will create serious regulatory risks across the market value chain. People will begin to look at it and say there is no independence of the industry regulator.”\nAttacks cause generation drop\nContrary to some newspaper reports (not Vanguard), the Power Ministry on its official website said Nigeria achieved energy generation of 3,664MW last Thursday, while energy sent out was 3, 578MW.\nThis shows 1,410MW slide from the 5,074MW, highest peak generated on February 2. It is also far below the peak demand forecast of 12,800MW.\nThe ministry attributed the decrease in power supply to the attack on Escravos gas pipeline, which it said led to a loss of 160 million metric standard cubic feet/day, MMSFCD, of gas.\nCounter directive, counter results\nBut corporate consumers, who spoke to Vanguard believed the counter orders were only making matters worse, as the Director-General, Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry, LCCI, Mr. Muda Yusuf, argued that the Senate directive to stay action on the new tariff regime might not achieve the desired result.\nHe said: “It’s doubtful whether it is within the competence of the legislature to give such a directive. A better approach would be for the legislature to invite the power firms to justify the increase.”\nRather than indulge in a show of power, he urged that provision of meters to consumers should be accelerated to put an end to estimated billing.\nOn his part, National President, Nigerian Association of Chambers of Commerce, Industry, Mines and Agriculture, NACCIMA, Dr. Bassey Edem, said: “We are not interested in the politics between the Executive and the Legislators. All we want is regular and sufficient power supply with which to run our businesses. This price fixing war may adversely affect the volume of power supply which will not be good for our businesses.”\nSimilarly, the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria, MAN, said: “We are not in support of agencies going against the Senate. We believe that the best way to go about this whole issue is simply by dialogue.”\nIt argued that “the tariff is welcome as long as they are charged for what is used via the installation of pre-paid meter across homes and office in the country. Like every Nigerian, we are happy that there is a hold to the tariff. Nigerians should be charged according to what is consumed. If the pre-paid meters were installed before embarking on the increase in tariff, it wouldn’t have raised eyebrows.”\nRather than getting some reprieves, Nigerians have been, instead, urged to brace up for tougher times due to the deterioration of power equipment.\nManaging Director, Egbin Power Plc, Mr. Kola Adesina, told Vanguard, weekend, that the primary cause of generation drop was the failure of machines and the inability to secure foreign exchange, forex, to replace them.\nAccording to him, “the overall crisis that the country is faced with is the exchange rate and that has equally trickled to the power sector. But that is not the primary cause; the primary cause is the failure of machine. But to replace those machines, you need forex and it is not available.”\nOrganised labour wants NERC, Amadi probed\nMeanwhile, organised labour has called for the probe of the NERC, and the former Chairman of the commission, Dr. Sam Amadi, over the controversy surrounding the recent hike in electricity tariff by 45 per cent.\nThe call for the probe of the former helmsman of NERC, Amadi, was based on an alleged statement credited to him (Amadi), asking the Senate to rescind its decision on the hike.\nFactional National President of Nigeria Labour Congress, NLC, Comrade Ayuba Wabba, in a statement in Abuja, described the statement by the former boss of NERC as “treacherous, shameful and saddening.”\nWabba stated that Amadi was “being economical with the truth and his legal knowledge. The duties of the Legislature, as defined by the constitution, include legislation, oversight and investigation.\n“Amadi not only described the Senate directive as a ‘dangerous precedence’, but has instigated NERC not to obey the directive as ‘it would have put itself in a double bind between the executive and legislature and a violation of the provisions of the Act’.”\n“On our part, we demand that the directive of the NASS be respected and effected right away. We also demand that if any DISCO or GENCO does not have the requisite capacity, it should honourably surrender its possessory and proprietary rights to government as was the case with the Yola Electricity Company. The Yola company was honourable enough and reasons adduced by it, genuine.\n“We will not fold our arms while a few individuals or companies or institutions further plunder and plunge this country into abyss.”\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"https://www.vanguardngr.com/2016/02/nobody-can-reverse-new-electricity-tariff-ex-nerc-boss/amp/","2":"1425","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999771118"},{"0":"German Engineering Firm Bilfinger Resolves Foreign Corrupt Practices Act Charges and Agrees to Pay $32 Million Criminal Penalty\nU.S. Attorney’s Office December 09, 2013 |\nWASHINGTON—Bilfinger SE, an international engineering and services company based in Mannheim, Germany, has agreed to pay a $32 million penalty to resolve charges that it violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) by bribing government officials of the Federal Republic of Nigeria to obtain and retain contracts related to the Eastern Gas Gathering System (EGGS) project, which was valued at approximately $387 million.\nActing Assistant Attorney General Mythili Raman of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division and Assistant Director in Charge Valerie Parlave of the FBI’s Washington Field Office made the announcement.\nAs part of the agreed resolution, the department today filed a three-count criminal information in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas charging Bilfinger with violating and conspiring to violate the FCPA’s anti-bribery provisions. The department and Bilfinger agreed to resolve the charges by entering into a deferred prosecution agreement for a term of three years. In addition to the monetary penalty, Bilfinger agreed to implement rigorous internal controls, continue cooperating fully with the department, and retain an independent corporate compliance monitor for at least 18 months. The agreement acknowledges Bilfinger’s cooperation with the department and its remediation efforts.\nAccording to court documents, from late 2003 through June 2005, Bilfinger conspired with Willbros Group Inc. and others to make corrupt payments totaling more than $6 million to Nigerian government officials to assist in obtaining and retaining contracts related to the EGGS project. Bilfinger and Willbros formed a joint venture to bid on the EGGS project and inflated the price of the joint venture’s bid by three percent to cover the cost of paying bribes to Nigerian officials. As part of the conspiracy, Bilfinger employees bribed Nigerian officials with cash that Bilfinger employees sent from Germany to Nigeria. At another point in the conspiracy, when Willbros employees encountered difficulty obtaining enough money to make their share of the bribe payments, Bilfinger loaned them $1 million, with the express purpose of paying bribes to the Nigerian officials.\nIncluding today’s action, the department has filed criminal charges in the Southern District of Texas against three institutions and four executives and consultants in connection with the EGGS bribery scheme:\nOn September 14, 2006, Jim Bob Brown, a former Willbros executive, pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to violate the FCPA in connection with his role in making corrupt payments to Nigerian government officials to obtain and retain the EGGS contract and in connection with his role in making corrupt payments in Ecuador. Brown was sentenced on January 28, 2010, to serve 12 months and one day in prison, to be followed by two years of supervised release, and was ordered to pay a $17,500 fine.\nOn November 5, 2007, Jason Steph, also a former Willbros executive, pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to violate the FCPA in connection with his role in making corrupt payments to Nigerian government officials to obtain and retain the EGGS contract. Steph was sentenced on January 28, 2010, to serve 15 months in prison, to be followed by two years of supervised release, and was ordered to pay a $2,000 fine.\nOn May 14, 2008, Willbros Group Inc. and Willbros International Inc. entered into a deferred prosecution agreement and agreed to pay a $22 million criminal penalty in connection with the company’s payment of bribes to government officials in Nigeria and Ecuador. On March 30, 2012, the government moved to dismiss the charges against Willbros on the grounds that Willbros had satisfied its obligations under the deferred prosecution agreement, and on April 2, 2012, the court granted the United States’ motion.\nOn December 19, 2008, Kenneth Tillery, a former Willbros executive, was charged with conspiring to make and making bribe payments to Nigerian and Ecuadoran officials in connection with the EGGS project and pipeline projects in Ecuador and conspiring to launder the bribe payments. Tillery remains a fugitive. The charges against Tillery are merely accusations, and he is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.\nOn November 12, 2009, Paul Grayson Novak, a former Willbros consultant, pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to violate the FCPA and one substantive count of violating the FCPA in connection with his role in making corrupt payments to Nigerian government officials to obtain and retain the EGGS contract. Novak was sentenced on May 3, 2013, to serve 15 months in prison, to be followed by two years of supervised release, and was ordered to pay a $1 million fine.\nThe case was investigated by the FBI’s Washington Field Office and its team of special agents dedicated to the investigation of foreign bribery cases. The case is being prosecuted by Senior Trial Attorney Laura N. Perkins of the Criminal Division’s Fraud Section.\nAdditional information about the Justice Department’s FCPA enforcement efforts can be found at www.justice.gov/criminal/fraud/fcpa.","1":"http://www.fbi.gov/washingtondc/press-releases/2013/german-engineering-firm-bilfinger-resolves-foreign-corrupt-practices-act-charges-and-agrees-to-pay-32-million-criminal-penalty#disablemobileThat","2":"1074","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9997397065"},{"0":"Buhari arriving the Nnamdi Azikiwe Airport, Abuja, on Monday, April 4, 2016, after attending the Nuclear Security Summit in Washington DC, USA\nWRITING this, my third article on the economy, I’m keenly aware that the question Nigerians want answered is: what is government doing to address our economic challenges?\nThe first thing to state is that there are no quick fixes, but our strategy is clear and the expected outcomes are pretty compelling. Our immediate economic imperative is to provide a Keynesian stimulus to reflate the economy. The 2016 focus is underpinned by a desire to radically reposition Nigeria’s economy. This administration believes very strongly that the previous direction was far from optimal. We are pursuing a fresh direction consistent with our belief in building a resilient economy.\nThe strategy itself is worth reiterating. The 2016 Budget is being debt funded and the borrowings are targeted at the financing of capital projects to address the infrastructure deficit, create jobs and build the platform for optimisation of the non-oil economy that will see Nigeria prosper. To this end, we have commenced an aggressive programme of fiscal housekeeping: increasing revenues and reducing recurrent expenses. This will ensure that we move towards our objective of financing recurrent expenditure from revenue, rather than borrowing as obtained before now.\nIn addition, we have signalled through our financial decisions that we are moving away from oil. Government investment in oil will be limited. We are inviting private sector participation in the funding of cash calls for our Joint Ventures rather than tapping the Federation Account. This is guaranteed to improve our cash flow. As I have stated previously, oil is important but oil is not enough. Therefore, if faced with an option to invest borrowed funds in our railways or power or fund oil cash calls, we will strategically fund non-oil. This is in the knowledge that there are private sector solutions to the funding needed for oil, but few sources other than government for investment in physical infrastructure.\nThe debate about whether Nigeria should borrow is well intentioned and cannot be dismissed without careful analysis, given our antecedents as a nation. I am in agreement with those who argue that Nigeria should not borrow simply because its debt to GDP level is low enough to accommodate such borrowing. There must be a clear business case backed by justifiable benefits. I believe that Nigeria has such a case at the present time. Simply put, we need capital investment to grow our economy. At 13% debt to GDP, we compare favourably with the threshold of 30% for developing economies. Our low debt to GDP ratio is not exactly a positive attainment because it is accompanied by critically low level of infrastructure investment. It is actually a false economy. Low capital formation is a risk which, if uncorrected, hinders future economic growth and this is already evident.\nBorrowing, as we propose, will increase debt to GDP to 16% and still leave us significantly lower than our peer group including Ghana at 70%, South Africa at 50% (2015) and Angola at 31% (2014). Appropriate levels of fiscal deficit have been used to grow many of the most successful global economies.\nEconomic multiplier effect\nAs ours develops, our sources of revenue will grow, diversify, and become less susceptible to external shocks. Our need to borrow will reduce accordingly. It’s important to note that capital spending creates an asset, and this gives a return over time in the form of growth. Infrastructural projects such as rail and roads create jobs, generate taxes and stimulate further spending. This is the economic multiplier effect that capital spending brings. Therefore, while an increase in public spending may create a deficit in the short term, the resultant increase in productivity will lead to a higher rate of economic growth and greater tax revenues. According to the International Finance Corporation (IFC), for every one billion US dollars invested in infrastructure in developing economies, between 49,000 and 110,000 jobs are created.\nOur borrowing policy will remain conservative and will see us access the lowest available funds, hence our decision to approach multilateral agencies in the first instance, for budget support at concessional rates as low as 1.5% per annum. We have also secured commitments from Export Credit Agencies that are tied to specific capital projects including key initiatives in power, transport and other infrastructure, and at semi-concessional rates. The balance will be sourced commercially to create a blended cost of capital that’s as low as possible. We are addressing the relatively high debt service to revenue ratio which saw 28.1% of our 2015 revenues devoted to debt. This will be done through a systematic restructuring of inherited debt portfolio into a profile that is aligned with our medium term outlook as well as an increase in our revenues.\nBorrowing is not our primary focus. Increasing our Internally Generated Revenue is critical because it is sustainable; and because much of the funds collected went unremitted to Government – something we are tackling now.\nRevenue collection processes\nOur Revenue Team holds daily revenue sessions with MDAs during which clear targets are set and agreed; monitoring and evaluation are continuous. We are deploying cash-less revenue collection processes in our high earning agencies to ensure maximisation of our receipts. We are working through Treasury Single Account balances with a view to identifying monies that can potentially be used to fund the budget and reduce borrowing.\nOther costly leakages are being blocked. We have completed a detailed review of tax and duty waivers and discovered that in some cases, Nigeria lost significant revenues and with limited benefits. We are set to begin consultations with stakeholders on a revised policy aligned with the best interests of Nigeria.\nFurthermore, we are identifying funds that can be released from hitherto untapped sources, including idle and underutilised government assets that have commercial potential including real estate. To this end, Ministry of Finance Incorporated (MOFI) is to become a professionally operated Asset Manager, rather than a passive holder of government assets. It will be actively managed to ‘sweat’ Nigeria’s very valuable global asset portfolio. This will generate earnings and constitute additional budget funding.\nGradually and with the requisite safeguards, we will authorise the investment of part of the estimated N6Tn currently held in pension funds into key infrastructure that will provide workers with higher returns on their pension funds while enhancing capital formation and economic growth. Nigeria’s first ever Project Tied Infrastructure Bonds are being designed. These are novel structures that will see borrowings tied to specific revenue generating projects, bringing private sector financial discipline to the project structuring and delivery process, thereby improving value.\nOur first quarter-planned release of N350Bn is ready and is sure to have significant impact, in addition to exploring opportunities to reduce contract prices. Our conditions for release of funds are clear and the mandate is a simple one: to define and agree the number of Nigerians to be engaged as a result of this funding. Priority will be given, without apology, to those creating jobs and opportunity for Nigerians. This level of investment, predominantly capital, exceeds the total capital spend for the whole of 2015 and the tempo will be sustained until the green shoots of recovery begin to appear.\nJohn Maynard Keynes’ famous quote on fiscal stimulus – that when economies are depressed, “Government should pay one man to dig a hole and pay another to fill it back” – is an extreme example and suggests an economic benefit in seemingly pointless activity. In Nigeria’s case, the activity to be triggered will be a fully productive one. We will pay men and women to meet our critical needs in power, transport, housing, agriculture, solid minerals, health and education – and lay the foundation for a collective future that is more positive than our current situation may suggest.\nOne of Nigeria’s greatest strengths is the resilience of her people. Even beyond our shores it is widely acknowledged that if you can survive in Nigeria, you can thrive anywhere. Our ability to overcome obstacles and our ingenuity in exploiting opportunities, are legendary; our economic policy will ensure more of us succeed in creating wealth.\nThere is sufficient diversity of opportunity which our capital investment can unlock. We will always celebrate the emergence of billionaires, of course, but we recognise that a thousand millionaires have greater fiscal impact. Therefore, where the number of private jets was touted in the past as a measure of success, we will take pride in the number of people lifted out of poverty, and the number of new jobs created. The idea that Nigeria can succeed this time is, for some, unthinkable. But for those of us privileged to be part of this determinedly patriotic team led by President Muhammadu Buhari, it is and will be possible.\nMrs. Kemi Adeosun is the Minister of Finance\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"http://www.vanguardngr.com/2016/04/financing-future-kemi-adeosun/?","2":"1804","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999866486"},{"0":"‘Buhari’ll win, handover to Igbo President in 2023’\n*Says PDP would lose states in the S’south\nA Christian cleric in Port Harcourt, Rivers state, Prophet Udeme Bassey, has predicted victory for President Muhammadu Buhari of the All Progressive Congress (APC) over Alhaji Atiku Abubakar of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), on Saturday.\nHe also predicted that Buhari would handover to an Igbo president in 2023, after successfully completing his tenure and bowing out as the most celebrated president in the nation’s history.\nProphet Udeme, who was spot on with his predictions in the 2015 election and Edo state 2016 governorship election, further stated that Buhari’s victory would defy the gang-up by former President Obasanjo and other prominent ex-rulers.\n“PDP kept Nigeria in the current situation that Nigeria is in today.

However, 2024 has seen an unexpected defiance of this trend in food prices.\nSunday Vanguard survey, covering Lagos, Abuja, Port Harcourt and Maiduguri, reveals increased prices for garri, beans, yams, corn, bread and cooking gas.\nRice prices range between N65, 000 and N68, 000 per bag while tomatoes’ prices have increased in Lagos.\nThe survey shows that prices for cooking gas and charcoal are steadily rising.\nA garri seller in Orile Market mentioned a significant increase in paint rubber garri price from N650 to N850 since December.\nIn the same market, a Derica (tomato can) of beans, which sold for N600 in December, now sells for N750.\nAt face value, the size of yams that cost N1, 400 in December has increased to N1, 600.\nThe same is true with the price of bread in the Orile area of Lagos.\nCompared to Iyana Ipaja Market on the outskirts of Lagos, the differences in the prices of agricultural products above are negligible.\nWhile poor Nigerians are making sacrifices for the survival of the nation by enduring the hardship that comes with adjustment in petrol pump prices, the political officeholders seem not to care.\nRather than Nigerian politicians cutting the cost of governance, they are busy living large and spending scarce resources on luxury.\nSunday Vanguard thus spoke with some top economic analysts on the tasks before government at all levels.\nOnly improvement in agric will solve food crisis – Prof Tella\nSheriffdeen Tella, a professor of economics at Olabisi Onabanjo University, Ago Iwoye, Ogun State, said, “The two policies implemented were actually in order. But the problems created thereafter ought to be expected and prepared for which did not happen.\n“The major problems are massive depreciation of naira, rising cost of production and what looks like galloping inflation.\n“I support most of the measures taken but not the modus operandi.\n“The provision of palliatives by FG through states was good but the states did not implement the palliatives simultaneously. Some have not even been implemented till now.\n“So, the conditions have worsened for many citizens. There’s a need to check what happens with palliative implementation in troubled states.\n“Only improvement in farming, agriculture and industrial production will solve the problems with financial and fiscal interventions and reduction in security problems.\n“Then we start working on production with largely domestic inputs.\n“For exchange rate, there is a need to ban importation of some products relating to food and clothing, go for a moratorium on some debts, and increase oil and gas exports with proceeds to solve debt repayment and servicing with excess as reserves for intervention in the FX market.”\nThere is urgent need to create policies that will tackle inflation – Yahaya, Chairman, Arewa Economic Forum\nChairman of Arewa Economic Forum, Mallam Ibrahim Yahaya, on his part, said, “While allocations have been increased to the other tiers of government by the Federal Government, it hasn’t impacted on the people.\n“So the Federal Government needs to do the needful by creating policies that will have direct inflation-mitigating effect on the people, especially the most vulnerable and it should be done as quickly as possible because people are at their tethers ends.\n“The government has done what it deemed necessary but it hasn’t done what’s needed to alleviate the expected sufferings of the people most especially those in the North bedevilled by insecurity, poverty and lack of necessary support from the Federal Government.\n“The sufferings are further enhanced by the closure of the northern borders thereby hindering trade and movement of people.\n“Equally, whilst saluting the doggedness of our security forces, we note also that their needs are not adequately met to assist them in discharging their duties.\n“Therefore, the government’s policies haven’t met the most basic of the needed assistance that the people need and deliberate government modernisation of the agricultural sector and funding of small and medium-sized businesses.”\nStates need to pay owed salaries, gratuities, pensions, and contractors — Tope Fasua, aide to VP Shettima\nMr Tope Fasua. Special Adviser on Economic Affairs, Office of the Vice President, said, “Over the weekend I did a market survey. The inflation is killing. I have informed the bosses.\n“State Governors are getting double from the Federation Account Allocation Committee (FAAC). “All of them are busting their budgets this year.\n“They should please start to pay owed salaries, gratuities and pensions; pay owed contractors; urgently issue contracts for projects with high local content e.g. roads and housing.\n“Our people need to be able to survive the skyrocketing cost of living. That paint can of beans is N5, 000; five big yams go for N9, 000; basket of onions N3, 000, I haggled but I know that these guys too are just trying to survive.\n“It is not good enough for the National Bureau of Statistics to simply supply us with new inflation numbers monthly and for us all to go to sleep afterwards, waiting for next month.\n“With the infrastructure I have in mind, the idea is to put in place a level of awareness, a response system, and regulation in place to tackle inflation before it runs away.\n“The best time to put such a system in place is a time like this – with inflation at 28.92 per cent (a 24-years high number), and the huge struggle to tame that runaway plunderer of value.\n“What Nigeria needs is not just to react to inflation numbers, playing the role of price-takers, and panicking.\n“We need to put in place right now, and for the future, systems and policies that will help us manage inflation today and in the future, ensuring that we don’t have wild swings.”\nImport food immediately at zero duty to crash prices — Aja, Financial Education Instructor\nKalu Aja, a Certified Financial Education Instructor (CFEI), on his X handle, raced through what federal and state governments should do: “Every federal agency should immediately do a steep reduction in taxes and dues charged. Suspend IGR for now, pull back on spending not geared towards human capital.\n“Give Julius Berger 5% equity of NNPC Ltd (they pay) and ask them to fix power. Same with CCECC, give them 5% of NNPC equity to connect all ports by rail to all regions.\n“Import food immediately at zero duty to crash prices of food and inflation. Customs should immediately reduce the dollar-based charges. NNPC, NAFDAC, JAMB, even FIRS should offer payment holidays.\n“The Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) can offer a tax credit to companies that increase workers salaries. Same for states, pull back on taxes and levies.\n“Federal Government should sell 10% of NLNG, use funds to state a nationwide affordable housing program, that’s jobs and consumption. Get the youth out of social media and into the job market. “Outsource if necessary the patrolling of the Nigerian nautical waters to prevent the stealing of crude oil. “Drop this national pride; if a Western Navy will assist, let them block oil theft completely.\n“Cut the executive and NASS budget by 25% to give savings to BOI and banks to set up equity funds and grants to MSMEs. We are in survivalist mode, not IGR mode, once we cross this phase, then IGR can restart”.\nPalliatives failed due to poor implementation — Ucheagwu, GM, Valmon Securities\nDr. Chukwuma, Ucheagwu, the General Manager of Valmon Securities Limited, said, “The current administration is running market-oriented policies which is a paradigm shift from a managed economy. These reforms’ objective is to correct the distortions in the system and sanitize the market.\n“It is important to note that these reforms are not short term and would bring about pains as the reform runs its full course. The removal of fuel subsidy and unification of the foreign exchange rate are key to the market-oriented policies. These twin policies are at the heart of main causes of high cost of living and inflation. The two variables are the root causes of the high inflation rate.\n“In economics, price is determined by the interplay of demand and supply. When demand is higher than supply, price increases and vice versa. In Nigeria we are predominantly a consuming nation. Our penchant for foreign goods is high hence the demand pressure on the equation is very high. Nothing meaningful has been done to address the supply side. Sources of government revenue are lean. We are more of a mono-product nation and our export base is narrow. We depend more on oil revenue to earn foreign currency while we chase the scarce available foreign currency for import leading to a perennial negative balance of trade.\n“Another factor stoking food inflation and exacerbating hardship is the heightened insecurity across the country. Banditry, kidnapping, farmers/herders’ rift, and terrorism are rife in the country. This situation has severely hampered farming even for subsistence purposes. The supply of food product is constrained hence increase in price.\n“The remedial policies put in place by the government in form of palliatives have not achieved the desired result due to poor implementation. We understand that the Federal Government sometime last year released a certain amount of money to the State Government to provide palliatives to their people based on need purposes.\nThere is no record that this initiative was well implemented. The federal government also released certain items to the Representatives in the National Assembly for their constituencies. It is not clear whether the objective was achieved. Given these failures, the government must rethink the strategies of dishing out these palliatives or hand-outs as it appears because they have not succeeded in addressing the challenge. We understand that governments (State and Federal) have placed orders for CNG-powered vehicles to cushion the effect of the high cost of transportation, but we have yet to see this happen.\n“Given the recent protest, the government should devise strategies to solve the problems of hunger and transportation in the short term. State governments should implement social welfare plans for their people.\nWhile the issue of minimum wage is being addressed at the federal level, governments should dole out allowances to workers in the interim. Government should assist farmers in all possible ways to achieve food security. There should be a food bank sponsored by the government to help the most vulnerable in society.\nThere should be mass transit vehicles to relieve transportation challenges, and this should be done urgently. The government should subsidize Medicare. The vulnerable should be able to access Medicare at little or no cost.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"https://www.vanguardngr.com/2024/02/hunger-in-the-land-top-economists-hand-to-do-list-to-tinubu/amp/","2":"2875","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9998989105"},{"0":"Ife chiefs appease gods over faulty broadcast of Ooni’s death\n•Sijuwade’s family members move out of palace\nMembers of the Iledi, a group of traditionalists, have begun rituals to appease the gods over the way the death of Ooni of Ife, Oba Okunade Sijuwade, the Olubuse II, was announced.\nSources within the Ogboni Ibile (Iledi Ooni) said that the announcement on social and traditional media broke traditional protocol.\nThey noted that the development could attract the wrath of the gods, hence the need to appease them to prevent calamities.\nSources revealed that the remains of Oba Sijuwade were committed to mother earth on Friday night, hours after an inter-religious service for the late monarch.\nChristians, Muslims and the traditionalists participated in the inter-religious service held at Enuwa Square, opposite the palace otherwise known as Ile Oodua.\nAccording to the palace sources, the body was buried after several traditional rites had been concluded.\nThe sources also revealed that people expecting a public burial for Oba Sijuwade were disappointed because “Ooni is not an ordinary individual, whose burial is done without rituals and ceremonies.\nThe members of the Iledi added that the burial rites on Oba Sijuwade’s body was done in 201 shrines before it was buried.\nIt was learnt that Oba Sijuwade’s successor would also pass through the 201 rites before being crowned the next Ooni.\nIledi Ooni is the group of traditional Ogboni, that works with the Ooni, offering wise counsels from the traditional point of view.\nThe group used to serve as the Supreme Court in the old days before modernity brought democracy and its institutions.\nMembers of the Sijuwade’s family have moved out of the palace with their property, leaving the palace free.","1":"http://thenationonlineng.net/ife-chiefs-appease-gods-over-faulty-broadcast-of-oonis-death/","2":"419","3":"Culture","4":"2","5":"en","6":"0.9999427795"},{"0":"By Steve Oko, Aba\nLawyer to the Indigenous Peoples of Biafra, IPOB, Mr Chukwuemeka Okoroafor, Friday, escaped an assassination attempt in Abuja, according to IPOB source.\nIPOB Leader Mazi Nnamdi Kanu who disclosed this in a press statement he personally signed, condemned the attack, describing it as “war on Biafra”.\nThe incident according to Kanu, occurred after the lawyer had visited a security facility where some IPOB members arrested at Obigbo Rivers State during the #EndSARS protest were detained in Abuja.\nKanu fingered security agents for the attack alleging that it was a ploy to scare lawyers from taking briefs from IPOB.\nThe statement read in part: “Following the assassination attempt made in Abuja today on Barrister Chukwuemeka Richard Okoroafor, the IPOB lawyer who has been making frantic efforts to secure freedom for our ladies abducted from Obigbo at the aftermath of the #EndSARS protest and taken to Abuja, I, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, the Leader of the Indigenous Peoples of Biafra, IPOB, want to put the world on notice that the Nigeria Government has declared war on Biafra.\nAlso read: Insecurity: CAN urges Buhari to proscribe all Miyetti Allah groups, stop visa on arrival policy\n“The assassination attempt was in their desperation to frustrate us from securing freedom for these innocent ladies who the uncircumcised and amorous elements in the security agencies have turned into their … slaves.\n“Barrister Okoroafor went to the military base in Suleja to confirm that our people are held there including Elvis Ngozi and 109 others.\n” On coming out to Suleja- Bida Road, an unmarked white Hilux just crossed and opened fire on him.\n“He told me that before leaving the base he discovered that his left back tyre was marked with black paint in the rim.

The agency admitted that although telecom operators are the highest deployers of masts in the state, the new standards may not affect them because their masts comply with international standards, approved specifications and quality of steel materials.\nIt however revealed that those that may be mainly affected included the banks, Internet Service Providers (ISPs), and other Small and Medium Enterprises, SMEs, that are using communication masts for their businesses.\nReeling out the new standards to bank officials in Lagos recently, General Manager of the agency, Mr. Joe Igbokwe warned that henceforth, all communication masts in the state not erected with galvanized steel materials and not between 30 metres and 50 metres high, contravenes the new standard.\nHe stated that the galvanized steel material replaces the hollow pipes that was hither to used by banks and ISPs in installing masts in the state.\nIgbokwe also noted that the new standards became imperative because of the coastal nature of Lagos and the global climate change.\nAccording to him, “the state government had since discovered that hollow pipes have little resistance to strong wind and other weather conditions like rain and sun, thus giving way easily to the slightest wind. This has resulted in collapse of several masts that have killed several people and destroyed property worth billions of naira in the state.\n“All hollow pipe type of masts must be removed and replaced with galvanized steel that has the shape of a pyramid. We will not accept re- painting of masts, but a complete evacuation of hollow pipe masts, and the evacuation must start now,” Igbokwe warned.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"http://www.vanguardngr.com/2013/07/lagos-govt-lists-new-standards-for-masts/","2":"464","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999599457"},{"0":"FG to hospitals: replace striking doctors with NYSC members\nBy Samuel Oamen\nThe Federal Government has directed tertiary hospitals to engage the services of National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) members to maintain routine services in place of striking resident doctors.\nMinister of Health Dr Osagie Ehanire said the measure to “mitigate the effect” of the strike by resident doctors across the country.\nThe National Association of Resident Doctors (NARD) embarked on nationwide strike on Monday over non-payment of their COVID-19 hazard allowance and other demands.\nTo address the absence of resident doctors as a result of the industrial action, Ehanire gave Federal Health institutions four guidelines to comply with.\n“COVID-19 treatment outlets should continue to function as before; emergency services should continue to run as before; routine services should be maintained with consultants, NYSC Doctors; locum staffers to be brought in when and where necessary to forestall services disruption when applicable and affordable,” the minister said.\n“I call on the NARD to return to work and engage the Federal Government in completing the ongoing due process of implementing the MoU between NARD and government.\n“I wish to assure the general public that measures have been put in place to ensure that they continue to access services at all our federal tertiary hospitals across the country,” he said.","1":"https://thenationonlineng.net/fg-to-hospitals-replace-striking-doctors-with-nysc-members/","2":"286","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999713898"},{"0":"Malami tells Senate panel: I met with Maina in Dubai\nJustice minister admits writing commission\n‘Maina ran account through sms, e-mail’\nA clearer picture of Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice Abubakar Malami’s role in the reinstatement of fugitive civil servant Abdulrasheed Maina emerged yesterday.\nThe minister admitted before a Senate ad hoc panel probing Maina’s reinstatement into the civil service and promotion to acting director that he met with Maina in Dubai, United Arab Emirates (UAE) last year.\nHe also said he wrote letters to the Federal Civil Service Commission (FRSC) on the sacked chairman of the Pension Reform Task Team.\nMaina was in 2015 accused of over N2billion pension fraud and declared wanted by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC).\nThe EFCC enlisted the International Police (INTERPOL) to trace Maina.\nBut he dramatically showed up in the country and was last month reinstated as acting director in the Ministry of Interior.\nAn embarrassed President Muhammadu Buhari ordered Maina’s immediate sack and a probe of how he was brought back. The EFCC stepped up its investigation. But Maina has not been seen since then.\nThe Senate panel is conducting its probe in camera with a promise to brief reporters at the end of its investigation.\nBut a source told The Nation last night that Malami, Interior Minister Abdulrahman Danbazau and Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Interior appeared before the committee.\nThe Interior minister and the permanent secretary insisted that they played no role in Maina’s recall that the attorney general admitted writing three letters to the Federal Civil Service Commission (FCSC) on Maina. But he said he did not bring him back.\nSenators reportedly asked the minister questions ranging from the authenticity of the correspondence between him and the FCSC, the constitutionality of his alleged directives to the commission and the extent of his involvement in the reinstatement of the controversial civil servant.\nAnother source close to the committee said: “Malami agreed before the parliamentary panel that he held a meeting with Maina in Dubai, although he insisted that he was not responsible for his dramatic return to the service. “\nThe source added: “The committee discovered that three letters were written by the Justice Minister asking questions from the FCSC on Maina. There is no record that the questions were answered by the FCSC in any correspondence.\n“The fourth letter was written by the Attorney-general in January as a directive to the Civil Service Commission to reinstate Maina. In the letter, the AG asked for Maina’s status, his position, rank and next rank.\n“There was another letter in February where the AG directed the Civil Service Commission to reinstate Maina. The committee frowned at this because under the constitution, they felt the AG cannot issue that kind of directive.”\nAccording to the source, the AG wrote another letter in April asking whether the reinstatement had been effected. In that letter, he directed the FCSC to promote Maina to Director.\nThe source added: “When committee members asked the AG to react to the allegations that he wrote the letters, the AG agreed that he wrote them, but said he could not remember all that he wrote. He pleaded with the committee to allow him contact his files to ascertain the content. He promised to return tomorrow. The committee agreed.\nThe source added: “The committee was satisfied that the Head of Service (HoS) of the Federation documented everything.\n“The Committee observed that she was tidy. It was learnt that at the sitting, the HoS did not release the purported letter written by the Civil Service Commission to Maina. The question the committee will be finding answer to on Thursday is where the Ministry of Interior got the letter it relied upon to reinstate Maina”.","1":"http://thenationonlineng.net/malami-tells-senate-panel-met-maina-dubai/","2":"813","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999160767"},{"0":"Senate President Lawan\nBy Henry Umoru\nTHE President of the Senate, Senator Ahmad Lawan has taken a swipe at the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, alleging that its maladministration in 16 years allowed for BoKo Haram insurgency to fester.\nLawan’s accusation was at the Presidential Campaign Rally of the ruling All Progressives Congress(APC) which took place in Damaturu Yobe State.\nThe rally was attended by the leader of the party, President Muhammadu Buhari who arrived in the state on official visit on Monday.\nIn a statement yesterday by his Media Adviser, Ola Awoniyi, the President of the Senate said: “PDP mismanaged and mal-administer Nigeria for 16 years.\n“When Boko Haram started in the northeast, in Borno state, the then leadership of PDP said it was not true.

He called on security agents to prove to Nigerians that they can defend them and ensure the safety of lives and properties.\nThe Muslim Rights Concern (MURIC) advised Nigerians to stop blaming President Buhari for the killings, saying: “Nigerian lawmakers should take the lion’s share of the blame, followed by the citizens and the media”.\nIt added that politicians, tribal bigots and a section of the media, which has been spreading wrong information about killings, should also take the blame.\nPresidential spokesman Femi Adesina said: “A popular refrain from some quarters is that the President is not doing enough to combat the insecurity that has beleaguered the country in recent times.\n“Lest that untruth begin to wear a garb of reality, let us consider some initiatives taken under the leadership of President Muhammadu Buhari to rein in the security situation, particularly since January, 2018.\nFor January 2018, Adesina said: “Leadership of the police deployed in Benue State, after mass killings reportedly committed by herdsmen. This was followed by a fact-finding team led by the Minister of Interior, and deployment of Special Forces of the military to restore law and order.\n“National Economic Council sets up 10-man committee on farmers/herdsmen clashes, headed by the Vice President.\n“The 1 Division of the Nigerian Army, Kaduna, launched a special operation,Karamin Goro (Small Kolanut), in collaboration with the Air Force, Police, Department of State Services, and Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps, NSCDC; to tackle kidnapping, robbery and cattle rustling in parts of Kaduna and Niger states (Minna-Birnin Gwari-Pandogari and Minna-Sarkin Pawa general areas).”\nIn February 2018, “the Nigerian Army commenced Exercise Ayem Akpatuma covering Benue, Taraba, Kogi, Nasarawa, Kaduna and Niger states, in order to tackle kidnappings, herdsmen/farmers’ clashes, among others”.\n“The Nigerian Air Force (NAF) inducted its first indigenous operational Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV),Tsaigumi. The newly-inducted UAV has day and night capability, an operational endurance in excess of 10 hours, a service ceiling of 15,000 feet and a mission radius of 100km, and is capable of being used for policing operations, disaster management, convoy protection, maritime patrol, pipeline, power line monitoring as well as mapping and border patrol duties.\n“The Nigerian Air Force (NAF) established 10 new Units as NAF had concluded plans to set up Quick Response Wings (QRWs) across Nasarawa State, in a bid to tackle the herders/farmers clashes plaguing some states within the axis.”\nIn March, Adesina said, the government took some steps, including President Buhari’s sympathy visits to states that had experienced wanton killings in the country.\n“The Nigerian Army extended Exercise Ayem Akpatuma in Taraba State by two months.\n“The committee set up by the National Economic Council on farmers/herdsmen clashes submits report, making far reaching recommendations for peace, including ranching in five states.\nFor April 2018, Adesina said the Air Force took delivery of a second batch of two brand new Mi-35N helicopter gunships to boost internal security. It deployed Special Forces to Zamfara State to combat criminality.\nIn May 2018, police inaugurated a Mobile Squadron in Takum, Taraba State, the Nigerian Air Force established three new Quick Response Wings (QRW) in Taraba, Nasarawa and Benue states, and deployed Special Forces personnel to these new bases. (Taraba State QRW is located in Nguroje; Nasarawa State QRW in Doma; and Benue State QRW in Agatu).\nAlso in May, “Inspector-General of Police Ibrahim Idris ordered the deployment of 200 policemen, and 10 patrol vehicles to Birnin Gwari (Kaduna-Zamfara axis) to tackle armed banditry in the area.\n“President Buhari approved the establishment of a new Battalion of the Nigerian Army, as well as a new Police Area Command, in Birnin Gwari LGA of Kaduna State, as part of measures to scale up the security response to the banditry affecting the area. Chief of Army Staff. Lt.-Gen. Tukur Buratai has since flagged off the new Battalion (2 Battalion Forward Operating Base, FOB) in Kanfanin Doka Village, Birnin-Gwari, Kaduna State.\n“The Defence Headquarters assembled a Special Military Intervention Force comprising more than 1,000 personnel, drawn from the Army, Air Force, Navy, Police, DSS and NSCDC, to respond to the security challenges in the North Central and North West. On May 8, 2018, the Force launched Operation WHIRL STROKE as a full-scale military operation to completely restore law, order and stability in the affected communities. The Whirl Stroke Operational Force Commander is Major General Adeyemi Yekini.\n“Chief of Army Staff inducted a mix of 49 Toyota Land Cruisers and Innoson gun trucks at the HQ of the 133 Special Forces Battalion of the Nigerian Army at Azare to support the ongoing OPERATION LAST HOLD in Northern Borno.\n“NAF launched newly-constructed accommodation for the 205 Combat Search and Rescue Group (CSARG) — established in 2017 to provide aid and operational assistance to wounded and distressed troops serving in combat units — in Kerang, Plateau State.\n“The Air Task Force of NAF commenced Operation THUNDER STRIKE to attack selected locations of Boko Haram Terrorists in the North-East.\n“The Nigerian Army commissioned its new Forward Operating Base in Epe, Lagos State.”\nAdesina said in June 2018, the NAF deployed combat helicopters to its 207 Quick Response Group (QRG) in Gusau, Zamfara State to support the fight against armed banditry in the town and its environs.\nPresident Buhari approved the establishment of Operation WHIRL STROKE II, for deployment in Zamfara and Kaduna states.\nSecuring the length and breadth of the country, he noted, is a continuing commitment.\n“It is one of the key pledges of the Buhari administration, which it is carrying out night and day,” the spokesman stressed.\nAccording to him, the security situation in the country in May 2015 when the administration came on board was in tatters.\nAdesina added: “It pulled up its bootstraps, rolled up its sleeves, set to work, and the Boko Haram insurgency was beaten back. It was eventually degraded.\n“Other security challenges are being tackled and will subsequently become history. Not doing enough, as some critics claim, is not part of the deal, nor is it reality, no, not by any stretch of the imagination. A lot is being done, and success is guaranteed,” he said.\nOshiomhole, speaking after the party’s National Working Committee (NWC) meeting yesterday, said Nigerians must come together with the same vigour they fought the Boko Haram insurgency to defeat the menace of herdsmen killings rather than attaching ethnic and religious sentiments to the killings.\nHe told the security agents to wake up to their responsibilities as no one will be satisfied with making explanations or try to explain away why we cannot secure human lives especially of a Nigerian citizen within the borders of Nigeria.\nHe said: “We have deliberated on the unfortunate incident that occurred in Sokoto state last week in which a number of innocent Nigerians were killed in cold blood by gunmen.\n“We are worried about this and our preliminary investigations showed that those affected come from a part of the state that can be said to quite rural and probably a place where people don’t even have cattle. All they have is just their farm land.\n“This killings, like other killings across the country is condemnable and the NWC condemn them in the strongest words possible, we believe that every Nigerian, regardless of his location has a right to life.\n“We admit that the minimum obligation of government is to protect lives and property and we urge our security chiefs to do everything possible not only to arrest all those involved in this senseless killing, but to do everything possible to be seen to have the competence to protect lives and property.\n“No one will be satisfied with making explanations or try to explain away why we cannot secure human lives especially of a Nigerian citizen within the borders of Nigeria.\n“We want to strongly appeal to all Nigerians and the media should help us in this process. This is the only country that we have and so, we must do everything to give every Nigerian a sense of security regardless of his accident of birth place which some people refer to as ethnic origin or his choice of residence of religious belief.\n“It is not helpful to national efforts of security lives and property if any Nigerian, including religious leaders and Media seeks to explain criminality in terms of religion or ethnic nationality. This is unhelpful in terms of our collective responsibility to work with security agencies to provide useful information that can lead to the arrest of criminals and also help them to preempt any plan by criminals to undermine our collective security.\n“Those responsible for the wanton killings in Sokoto and those who are victims are of the same ethnic origin and unarguably of the same religious persuasion. It is the same thing in Zamfara state.\n“It is not between one ethnic group or the other and so, if these criminals found themselves in other parts of the country as they have done from time to time, and their victims are of different ethnic origin, we should insist that we treat them for who they are, criminals that government has a duty to pursue and chase out of the territory of Nigeria and all those who are perpetuating crimes be brought to justice in accordance with the provisions of our laws.\n“As a nation, we should all be united, not only in co democracy in this wanton killing, but also in helping government to do what it has to do compel security agents to live up to their mandate. It is clearly unhelpful and it bothers on divisive politics if we seek to disguise criminality either in religious terms or ethnic terms.\n“Government has a duty to protect all citizens regardless of their religious belief. I ask the Media to help us to educate the people that it does not help the process of law enforcement if crime and criminality are identified in terms of their ethnic origin or their religion.\n“But we are together as a party and Nigerians that this killings stand condemned and our security must do everything possible to convince Nigerians that under their leadership, we are safe and secured. They must continue to review their operational modalities in the light of emerging threats.\n“The Buhari government is determined to do everything possible to secure the live and property of every Nigerian. That is one of the key objective that this government committed itself to. Unfortunately , as much as we have made progress, we cannot but commend the President and security agents in decimating Boko Haram.”\nIn a statement in Ibadan yesterday, quoted by the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) MURIC’s Director Prof. Ishaq Akintola, said “Nigerian lawmakers should take the lion share of the blame, followed by the citizens and the media.\n“They should all accept their culpability in this peculiar mess instead of blaming the executive since the latter has done what is humanly possible within the law.’’\nHe said it was unfair to blame Buhari for Nigeria’s inability to stop killings because security was a collective responsibility, particularly the different arms of government.\n“The executive, judiciary, legislature and the press as the fourth estate of the realm also has a vital role to play as well as the citizens.\n“The legislature, instead of cooperating with the executive, is an open enemy even in a sensitive matter like the security of lives and property.\n“As killings occur on a daily basis, Buhari made a move in April to procure more weapons to fight insecurity but the senate turned down the request.\n“National Assembly made so much fuss about Buhari’s request for $1 billion from the Consolidated Revenue Fund, threatening to impeach him for approving its release without its consent.\n“The same self-serving legislature delayed the budget for seven months just to get back at the executive and of course no money can be released before the Appropriation Act is signed into law.\n“The national Assembly also declined to accede to Buhari’s request to approve the sum of $496 million for the procurement of Super Tucano aircraft from the United States.\n“Yet Nigerians failed in their duty to question the right of their lawmakers to endanger their lives,’’ Akintola said.\nAkintola said the recent revelation by Hon. Ahmed Maje that certain politicians sponsored killers and assassins who were trained in Israel has completely absolved President Buhari in the killings.\nMURIC urged Nigerians to adopt a holistic approach to killings occurring in the country.\n“Farmer-herder clashes are common everywhere, particularly in West Africa and Nigeria is not an isolated case but we are behaving as if Nigeria is an island.\n“Take Ghana as an example. Earlier this year, cattle rustlers invaded farmlands in Ashanti, Volta, Brong Ahafo and the Eastern regions leading to killings and the destruction of farms.\n“But Ghanaians did not crucify their president because of the clashes but solve the problem by establishing their first cattle ranch last week at Afram Plains in the eastern region. It plans to establish more in the Volta and Ashanti regions.\n“It is time to face realities. We must borrow a leaf from Ghana. That country is as multi-religious and multi-cultural as Nigeria,’’ Akintola said.","1":"http://thenationonlineng.net/what-buhari-has-done-on-killings-by-presidency/","2":"3061","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9997987747"},{"0":"Atiku Abubakar smiles again\nOne-time vice president of Nigeria, Atiku Abuabakar, has been fighting several battles in recent times.

The meeting of the financial experts to consider the question of rehabilitation of displaced persons has not been held because the Ministry of Finance does not think that such that such a meeting would serve any useful purpose. The army experts met and reached agreements, but these were rejected.\nLieutenant-Colonel Yakubu Gowon told the Heads of Missions that the agreement about returning the regions to the positions before January 17 also meant in effect that the federal government in Lagos would continue to carry on its functions as before. He failed to inform the world that the decisions taken at Aburi, the federal government meant no more than the Supreme Military Council. No one of course who knows the sort of advice Lieutenant-Colonel Gowon is receiving in Lagos would be surprised by this suppression and distortion of the truth.\nThe actual Aburi decisions read as follows:\nMembers agree that the legislative and executive authority of the Federal Military Government should remain in the Supreme Military Council, to which any decision affecting the whole country shall be referred for determination provided that where it is possible for a meeting to be held the matter requiring determination must be referred to military governors for their comment and concurrence.\nSpecifically, the council agreed that appointments to senior ranks in the police, diplomatic, and consular services as well as appointment to superscale posts in the federal civil service and the equivalent posts in the statutory corporation must be approved by the Supreme Military Council.\nThe regional members felt that all the decrees passed since January 15, 1966, and which detracted from previous powers and positions of regional governments, should be repealed if mutual confidence is to be restored.\nIt is difficult to understand the introduction of the word “veto” into the matter. The Aburi Agreement was that any decision which affected the whole country must receive the concurrence of all the military governors because of their special responsibilities in their different area of authority and so to the country as a corporate whole.\nOn the reorganization of the army, it is for Lieutenant-Colonel Gowon to explain to the world what he means by the “army continuing to be under one command,” when in the very next sentence of his statement he also speaks of an agreement to establish area commands corresponding with the existing regional boundaries. This contradiction in itself tells the truth, and one does does not need to belabor the point.\nThe actual decision of the Supreme Military Council as recorded in the official minutes reads as follows:\nThe Council decides that:\n(i) on reorganization of the army:\n(a) Army to be governed by the Supreme Military Council under a chairman to be known Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces and Head of the Federal Military Government.\n(b) Establishment of a military headquarters comprising equal representation from the regions and headed by a Chief of Staff.\n(c) Creation of area commands corresponding to existing regions and under the charge of area commander.\n(d) Matters of policy, including appointments and promotions to top executive posts in the armed forces and the police, to be dealt with by the Supreme Military Council.\n(e) During the period of the military government, military governors will have control over area commands for internal security.\n(f) Creation of a Lagos garrison, including Ikeja barracks.\nIt is clear from the Aburi decisions that what was envisaged was a loosely knit army administered by a representative military headquarters under the charge of a Chief of Staff and commanded by the Supreme Military Council, not by Lieutenant-Colonel Yakubu Gowon as he claimed in his present statement to the diplomats.\nAccording to the Aburi Agreements “the following appointments must be approved by the Supreme Military Council; (a) diplomatic and consular posts; (b) senior posts in the armed forces and the police; (c) superscale federal civil service and federal corporation posts.”\nEveryone with even the most superficial acquaintance with the Nigerian civil service knows what those expressions mean and connote.\nTo confuse issue, Lieutenant-Colonel Gowon gave the impression that the main difference between him and me on this particular decision was that I insisted on canceling the appointments of existing civil servants. I can think of nothing more slanderous.\nIt is clear from Gowon’s statement in question that he is prepared to distort the verbatim reports of the Aburi meeting. To keep the public informed, the Eastern Nigerian Broadcasting Service will be playing the tape records of the proceedings live at scheduled times…. Arrangement have been completed to transform those tape recordings to long-playing gramophone records … We are also going ahead to print and publish the documents and records of Aburi meeting. We in the East are anxious to see that our difficulties are resolved by peaceful means and that Nigeria is preserved as a unit, but it is doubtful, and the world must judge whether Lieutenant-Colonel Gowon’s attitudes and other exhibitions of his insincerity are something which can lead to a return of normalcy and confidence in the country.\nI must warn all Easterners once again to remain vigilant. The East will never be intimidated, nor will she acquiesce to any form of dictation. It is not our intention to play the aggressor. Nonetheless, it is not our intention to be slaughtered in our beds, We are ready to defend our homeland.\nFellow countrymen and women, on Aburi We Stand. There will be no compromise.

In an interview, he affirmed that his mission as National Publicity Secretary of the PDP would be to de-market the ruling All Progressive Congress. He speaks on his plans and strategies.\nBy Rotimi Omoyela\nWhy do you want to be the Publicity Secretary of the Peoples Democratic Party?\nI’m a committed member of the PDP. I have never belonged to any other party since I joined party politics. Again, I will say that I have paid my dues in terms of projecting the PDP, in Ekiti State, Southwest and Nigeria as a whole. Most importantly, the leader of the party in this state, Dr. Ayodele Fayose is interested in me becoming the National Publicity Secretary of the party.\nHow would you assess the present Publicity Secretary of your party, Chief Olisa Metuh performance?\nI’m a forward looking person, I don’t dwell on the past, I don’t go about condemning and castigating people, the environment in which Mr. A operated last week, may be different from which Mr. B is operating now and the environment in which Mr. C will operate tomorrow might be different. So the strategy that worked yesterday would obviously be different from the one that might be applied tomorrow. I’m not saying those who have handled the media in the past have not done their best, in the political environment they operated, they did their best, I’m willing to pick up from where they stopped.\nDo you think you have what it takes to be Publicity Secretary of a Political Party?\nI’m a journalist and have been in this job for 19 years. I started active journalism since my days in the Nigeria Institute of Journalism, I have practiced as a publisher, as a reporter, I have been involved in broadcast journalism, print journalism and even social media journalism.\nThe Peoples Democratic Party as at now appeared to be riddled with crisis and internal strife, what image do you intend to give a party of this nature?\nPolitics is about conflict and conflict resolution when you have an organisation with varieties of interest there will always be conflicts. Unfortunately, we allowed minor crises to balloon into a major issue. Like every other political party, we have our share of crises in the PDP, and it is normal in politics, because of the divergent interests. The APC that is the ruling party today has its share of crises because of the divergent interests in that party. You must be aware of what is going on within the APC, and it has not been consumed by the crisis, PDP too will not be consumed by its crisis.\nSome say that the consensus arrangement used in the last congresses in Ekiti State is akin to imposition?\nI can tell you that there was no imposition of anyone. Don’t get it wrong. Consensus is never an imposition; they are not the same thing. Consensus is a mechanism put in place to discourage acrimony and rancour among contenders for a particular position.\nIt’s an arrangement put in place to encourage contestants to step down for each other and allow the best candidate who is properly fit for a position to emerge, but in a situation where nobody wants to step down, we can call for the outright election to settle the matter.\nWhat are your other plans for the projection of the image of your party?\nPolitical communication is simple, you tell the people what your party is capable of doing, you tell the people what your party would have done differently, by making the people see that if our party is the party in government, we would have done things differently. It is about marketing your party and de-marketing your competitors; my job is to market the PDP and de-market APC.\nThe latest crisis in PDP has to do with zoning and gladiators in Southwest want the chairmanship zoned to the area. But Governor Fayose has a different opinion, what is your take?\nThe Chief Executive Officer of any political party is the Secretary, are you saying this position is not important? The National Publicity Secretary is the mouthpiece of the party, are you saying that is not important too?\nThough this issue has been resolved, and I would not like to go into it. With two governors in the Southwest are they complaining? Those are the major stakeholders in the party as at today.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"http://www.vanguardngr.com/2016/05/plan-de-market-apc-lere-olayinka/","2":"966","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999980927"},{"0":"By Shola Ogundipe & CHIOMA OBINNA\nFor most couples, the birth of a baby elicits joy. For some, the birth of twins or more elicits even greater joy and gratitude but when a woman is safely delivered of quadruplets (four babies) or quintuplets (five), her joy is supposed to be boundless.\nSuch is the case of Mr. Wale Shofunlayo and his wife, Olayemi who were blessed with a healthy set of quintuplets weekend at the Lagos University Teaching Hospital, LUTH.\nAccording to Wale, the couple’s joy is immesureable as they did not prepare for five babies at a go.\nAs a Lawyer, Wale is under no illusion about the birth of their quintuplets. To him, the birth of the babies confirmed the adage that “Doctors care and God heals. ”\nBefore the babies came, the couple had prepared for quadruplets as the doctors’ investigation including comprehensive scan showed that there were four babies. But little did they know that posterity had another plan for them. A gift, which could be described as the best Christmas gift anyone could get at a time like this.\nVanguard gathered that the middle aged woman who gave birth to two boys and three girls was said to have been in the hospital since last June waiting for the arrival of the babies that finally came last week Friday.\nDoctors at LUTH had recommended bed rest from the seventh month till delivery.\nThe delivery, which was taken by over 50 active medical personnel at the hospital all started like a fairy tale when the first, second, third and fourth baby came and the leader of the medical team, identified simply as Professor Ajayi discovered that there was still ‘something’ in the womb.\nApparently confused with the fact that all the while, medical examinations continually show only four babies, the experts almost jumped to conclusion that what was left must be fibroid tissue. But thanks to experience, that made them hesitant in terminating whatever may be there or seal up the opening without further probe.\nFurther check thereafter showed that the fifth baby was actually on the way. Each of the five babies weighed at least 1.5 kg while the biggest weighed 1.8 kg.\nNarrating her experience to Vanguard, Mrs. Olayemi whose joy knew no bounds described the delivery as a pleasurable experience and surprise package from God.\nOlayemi who was still recuperating said, “I and my babies are fine. I was expecting four. After everything, I found out they were five”.\nIn a chat with Vanguard, father of the babies, who declined comments on the possibility of an Assisted Reproductive treatment said “We have a 2 -year -old -boy already but to have the quintuplets is God’s doing. Our first baby was delivered at Lagoon hospital. I’m a Muslim and I give glory to Allah for this rare blessing. It is not every day one is blessed with five children at a go.\n“We have heard of instances of two, three, or four babies at once, but this is the first time I would hear about five and I feel so elated to be the one to have this number. I feel great, I feel happy and I give all glory to Almighty God without him nothing can happen.\n“We were actually expecting four babies according to the scan. The doctors said there were four but God showed Himself and added the fifth one. They are two boys and three girls, he said.”\nWale, who would not reveal whether or not he and his wife went through assisted reproduction, is optimistic about the future.\nOn his reaction when he was told that his wife had five babies, he said:”I planned to have many children and my prayer is to provide for them to the best of my ability. I am not just knowing my wife was pregnant with multiple babies, we had been told there were four babies like I said earlier, and my wife has been on bed rest in the last seven months. I know God is there for me and my family”.\nThe Ogun State born Wale who was full of gratitude to the medical personnel that attended to his wife at LUTH, said “I must specially thank Prof. Ajayi for his experience. An inexperience doctor would have sealed up the opening or terminate the last baby”\nHe described the quality of care given to the babies as excellent. “I give kudos to the nurses and doctors who attended to my wife and babies. I am more than satisfied with their services.\nAsked if he is financially comfortable with the development, Wale said’ “I will not say it is the duty of government to take care of my babies. I don’t have the intention of begging with this publication but if anyone feels like helping it will be welcome.\nI don’t like going to people and being turned down. Even as a Lawyer, we don’t advertise, I don’t see the reason why I should do that because of these babies.\n“But being human no one can have it all, so any assistance is welcome but that is not to say we will go cap in hand begging for aid. I have a job I’ve been doing for 19 years and God has been faithful”, he added. In the views of the Public Relation Officer of LUTH, Mrs. Hope Nwalolo, the birth of the babies was not the first case of multiple birth recorded by the hospital. According to her, the delivery took less than 30 minutes as there were experienced medical professionals on ground.\nWhat experts say about multiple births\nMultiple births are a type of multiple birth in which the mothers give birth to two or more offspring from the same pregnancy. The occurrence and frequency, however, vary dramatically.\nIn the views of a fertility expert, Dr. Abayomi Ajayi of Nordica fertility Centre, Lagos and Asaba, “Factors such as maternal age, socio-environmental factors, increase in the use of contraceptives, the race of human population, increase in the spontaneous abortion rate, and seasonal variations are among the factors that could influence multiple birth including twinning (two babies), triplets (three babies) and quadruplets (four babies)\nAssuming they are alive, Nigeria’s first known multiple birth babies (sextuplets) would be 103 years old today. Historical and medical records show that the birth of the first set multiple babies in Nigeria dates back over 100 years ago to 1907 when an unnamed 19-year-old woman from the South East region was delivered of six babies in a row after a short labour.\nAlthough it is not known what their male/female sex ratio was or how many of the babies eventually survived, the event, like that of the controversial multiple birth babies, elicited as much drama, and graphic insight as to just how demanding all multiple births can be.\nFor several decades, multiple birth has been a regular feature in Nigeria. Multiple births refers to the delivery of twins and higher order multiples (eg, triplets, quadruplets, quintuplets, etc). Multiple births occur when multiple foetuses are carried during a pregnancy with the subsequent delivery of multiple births. Specifically, since the late 1970s, the prevalence of multiple births in Nigeria has been increasing.\nA combination of factors including the widespread use of assisted reproductive techniques and advancing maternal age at conception is associated with this phenomenon. Records are scarce, but it is believed that a plateau in the prevalence.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"http://www.vanguardngr.com/2011/12/multiple-birthdoctors-say-4-but-god-added-another/","2":"1600","3":"Religion","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999904633"},{"0":"By Wole Masadomi\nMinnaâ€”Niger State Governor, Dr. Muâ€™azu Aliyu, weekend said the people of the state will resist any attempt to frustrate the former military President, Gen.

If for any reason it was discovered that the concept is no longer workable, all we need to do is to sit round the table and reviewed our earlier stand and move on so that nobody will be offended.\nHe said further, â€œZoning or rotation of the Presidency is a PDP affair, now that the issue is generating a kind of confusion, it is left for the party caucus to sit on a round table and discuss on how to unravel the matter so that we can move forward.â€\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"http://www.vanguardngr.com/2010/08/02/people-ll-resist-attempt-to-frustrate-ibb-out-of-pdp-gov-aliyu/","2":"562","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999904633"},{"0":"Igbos must get presidency in 2023-Anambra Bishops\nBy Nwanosike Onu, Awka\nAs the battle for which geo political zone will succeed President Mohammadu Buhari in 2023 gathers momentum, some clerics have declared it is now or never for Igbo.\nAnglican Bishop of Mbammili in Anambra West local government Area,Most Rev Henry Okeke and Bishop Emma C Obiorah, say its the only thing that can bring peace and unity in the country .\nThe two Igbo clerics, spoke during the celebration of Christo Feast 2019 at Life of Faith Gospel Assembly Ministries headquarters at 3-3 , Nkwelle Ezunaka, Oyi local government area, while speaking with The Nation\nAccording to Obiorah: “For the country to survive, we need every tribe, we need equity and it is the turn of Igbo man to be the President of Nigeria.\n“The impression some people have created against Ndigbo is bad.\n“God loves Igbo the way He loves others.

About 40 years ago, I was born into the Giesi Ruling House, Ojaja Royal Compound in the ancient city of Ile-Ife.\nFrom birth, my life has been a journey; one that I embarked on, saddled with great conscientiousness when I became a responsible father at the age of 19, which shaped and groomed me for greater challenges ahead.\nTo cater for my family as a young father, I became very enterprising with the knack of building something out of nothing. This certainly increased my temperament for being successful in all my endeavours, as well as towing the right path as a responsible father.\nThus, in the following years, I was able to build a consortia of companies with a team of well-versed, highly skilled and unskilled professionals from scratch and with hard work and God’s providence. This has made me a huge employer of labour and a captain of industries. The story of Ile-Ife begins as the cradle of civilization and has spread its tentacles beyond Black Africa.\nThe Ooni stool is highly revered and exalted and as the world looks on; our strength and emphasis need to be injected into the development of Ile-Ife as a beacon of hope and enviable city.\nSpiritual home of all Yoruba\nSuffices to say that Ile-Ife is the ancestral and spiritual home of all Yorubas, bona fide, in Nigeria and the Diaspora, and the World Headquarters of the House of Oduduwa, which comprises people resident in nearly all the continents of the world.\nThus, the Ooni, as the head of the vast Oduduwa family, must be no less versatile and resourceful. Available evidences from the curatorial community and archaeological discoveries have put the origin of Ile-Ife around 2000 years BC.\nAround this time, the people of Ile-Ife have distinguished themselves in technology and cultural advancement. A notable fact in this direction is Ori-Olokun: though purportedly ‘discovered’ by the famous German archaeologist Leo Frobenius in 1910, but had been in existence for thousands of years.\nDiscovery: The pure-copper sculpture took the entire arts world by storm at the time of its discovery that experts from the West argued that the artefact was a mystery that was too sophisticated to have been created by African hands. However, after careful examinations of other works, profusely located in and around the city and bearing striking resemblance, the world accepted the truth that the advanced people of Ile-Ife had, not only wielded the technology to turn iron to alloy but also of moulding abstract artworks out of the product. Consequently, it is now accepted by the curatorial community that the advanced artistic techniques used to create the sculpture were more advanced than those of Renaissance Italy, and comparable to those of [the artist] Donatello.\nYet, Ile-Ife has not taken its rightful position as the ‘source’ of civilization despite her wealth of history, culture and tradition.\nHaving found ourselves in such state of affairs where the potential of the land remains untapped and its people lacking economic and social emancipation, we should all take it upon ourselves to redress this situation.\nRedressing the situation\nThe Ile-Ife of ‘my dream’ will be strategically positioned to empower its people socially, economically and culturally to bring about the desired developments. Now, with our resolve to transform Ile-Ife we are ‘SET’ to leave no stone unturned, in the drive to put Ile-Ife on the map of the world. Our ultimate goal is to reposition the House of Oduduwa as a worthy example of successful inward-looking community.\nAt this juncture, I consider it pertinent to share with everyone the account of how Nigeria as a nation came to be. The Royal Niger Company was a mercantile company charter by the British government in the nineteenth century. It was formed in 1879 as the United African Company and became the Royal Niger Company in 1886. By 1900 it went through several name changes and in 1914 a merger occurred between the Southern Nigeria Protectorate and the Northern Nigeria Protectorate to become the independent Federal Republic of Nigeria in 1960. It suffices to say our beloved nation developed through a corporation of technocrats and quality mind input. Arguably, this is one of the several ways cities and communities are built; through large corporations. The ethos of this account goes to prove that any geographic setting can undergo boundless growth through clusters of companies which invariably can lead to the creation of settlements and human capital development.\nConsequently, there is a huge possibility for Ile-Ife to experience tremendous growth through industrialization and developmental projects like a company managed by dedicated sons and daughters of Ife and all Ife enthusiasts. I have no doubt, Ife will be great again due to its economic dexterity. Ife has one of the largest land mass in the South-west beaming with natural resources including three out of the four factors of production; ‘land’, ‘labour’ and ‘entrepreneurship’ and with our great resolve we shall work towards ‘capital’ creation.\nI am very passionate about my roots with the determination of bringing Ile-Ife to the forefront of economic and social affairs. In my private life, I have for a while been involved in many philanthropic gestures in Ile-Ife and its environs. The progressiveness of the youths of Ile-Ife is at the core of my philosophy and I have been instilling hope to thousands of youths through the various ongoing reciprocity Programmes I established a while ago.\nIt is within the dictates of our culture that the young shall provide for the old and for this reason our youths need to be nurtured and engaged positively hence they can attain financial independence and in return provide for their parents, families and dependants. This is not to say that the old and elderly will be left out. There will be various empowerment Programmes for the elderly and the widowed to learn new trades and acquire new skills that will help stamp out redundancy and at the same time be financially rewarding to them.\nMany might argue that the tasks before me are incredibly monumental and impossible. However, I do not get easily swayed by the idea of impossibilities. In every challenging situation what I see is a speck of possibility which I build on till the task at hand is completed. I have done this time over time and I have defied the rules of men to follow my gut instincts. I have excelled where, people had predicted failure and I derived the most joy where others have said emphatically “it is not possible.”\nA recent classic example of turning impossibilities to possibilities took place at ‘Parakin’ in Ile-Ife where I converted a sizeable piece of thick forest land into a beautiful castle within a month. The land hitherto, was a garbage dump and an escape route for men of the underworld in the vicinity which constituted a social menace to the inhabitants of ‘Parakin’.\nIn recent history one cannot mention Ile-Ife without acknowledging the Ife and Modakeke conflict. It’s unfortunate that lives were lost during the war between Ife and Modakeke; a war that had no economic value and displaced many lives. I paid a courtesy visit to the youths affected by the war and implored them to be proactive. Furthermore I urged them to be on the straight and narrow path and propagated the tenets of hard work as the only way to make it in life.\nIn the course of my life I have had many touching experiences. However, my most compelling experience till date involves two young boys namely Demola Adewole and Taye Fayemi. Demola and thousands of others energetic youths visit work sites on a daily basis to solicit for money. I took it upon myself to get to know these young boys and found that all they wanted was to earn a decent living. We got acquainted with Demola and found out he was a welder. Without hesitation, we helped to re-orientate him and got him involved in construction work in ‘Parakin’. Demola Adewole has turned out to be one of the best welders I have been privileged to work with till date.\nAnother set of energetic youths on one of the days I visited Ife chased after my car, many of them climbed onto the fast moving car and during the tussle to stay latched on to the car, one of them got injured. I got out of the car and addressed all of them and asked why they would want to hurt themselves and with no care in the world, Taye replied “death means nothing to me”; I shed tears, there is no hope for the youths and no one to rebuild their dashed hopes or future.\nTaye Fayemi was simply desperate to make a living for himself and today, to the glory of God I personally supervise Taye’s rehabilitation, his personal development and wellbeing.\nDestinies: Similar to the story of Demola and Taye, are thousands of youths with different expertise that need our help to find their feet, many whose destinies would have been cut short like the others lost the war. I cannot but emphasize that the development and well being of our youths is paramount to our future and one that is very close to my heart.\nThis area needs to be properly addressed to ensure our youths are well engaged in various professional and vocational pursuits.\nToday, and to the glory of God, I have been energized to rehabilitate and take off the streets several thousands of youths by providing them with gainful employment. Furthermore, we shall set up a foundation that will support post war effects and the rebuilding of war torn Ife and Modakeke.\nThereafter there shall NEVER be war again. I stand firmly for peace and unity between Ife and Modakeke and I guarantee that this peace and unity will transcend into economic and social benefits for everyone.\nSimilarly, we shall use this stool to unify the entire Yoruba race; there shall be no division, no supremacy or animosity amongst us, we are all from the one and the same source-God Almighty.\nComing to the throne is a clarion call to heed my selfless desire to serve the people of Ile-Ife, the Yoruba race and all of humanity. We will use the stool to provide a lot of opportunities to invest in the youths through mentor-ship and empowerment programs that will further take thousands off the streets on a gradual basis. Youths all over the country will be eligible for the mentor-ship programme and Ife will be the pilot model. We will use the stool to transpose Ile-Ife into the twenty-first century and with the use and influence of social media we are ‘set’ for his transformation. Sons and daughters of Ife and Ife enthusiasts around the world will have an input in the building of the New Ife City, ‘NIC’ through constructive feedback. ‘Socially’, we are ‘set’ to revive and promote Ile-Ife as a tourist destination.\n‘Economically’ we are ‘set’ to increase our industrial footprints to give Ife the much desired facelift and ‘Traditionally’ we are ‘set’ to redefine the kingship system by blending modernity into our cultural values and practices and our tradition of thousands of years will stand.\nPlans are well under-way to revitalize Ife in the areas of Sports, Mining, Agriculture, Real Estate, Tourism and rapid industrialization. To achieve this transformation, a brand new platform named ‘House Of Oduduwa Resources Limited’ has been established to stimulate the entire economy of Ile-Ife with a positive impact on the entire Yoruba race and our nation as a whole. ‘House Of Oduduwa Resources Limited’ will be tasked with rebuilding Ife into the ‘New Ife city’, NIC.\nHowever, this is a herculean task which can only be achieved with the support of all well-meaning technocrats, sons and daughters of Ile-Ife in Nigeria and in the Diaspora and all lovers of Ife. My fervent desire is to grow ‘House Of Oduduwa Resources Limited’ into one of the\nbiggest corporations out of Africa, likewise uniting all lovers of Ife with the people of Ife. Earlier this year, I acquainted the youths of\nIle-Ife of my plans to replicate the truly Nigerian project, Inagbe Grand Resorts Lagos, Nigeria (almost hundred percent of raw materials\nused are locally sourced) in Ile-Ife. Inagbe Grand Resorts is the first of its kind and will soon be the most sought after resort destination in all of West Africa. I have developed an incredible master plan for the proposed ‘Ife Grand Resorts’ which will be an off shoot of ‘Inagbe Grand Resorts Lagos’. The ‘Ife Grand Resort’ project and the ‘NIC’ initiative was conceived to attract young men and women, businesses, corporate organization, investors, holiday makers, lovers of Ife and Ife in Diaspora to a comfortable ambience to stay when they are away from home. This will continually put Ile-Ife, the cradle of black civilization on the map likewise showcasing many artefacts about the Yoruba race, hence creating a steady influx of people into Ile-Ife.\nThe time has come for us to embrace our true heritage as the progeny of Oduduwa and the task of modernizing Ile-Ife is yours and mine. I am highly honoured to have been chosen to fill the stool that great men once occupied; history and I will forever remember this day. I use\nthis opportunity to pay tribute to Oba Adesoji Aderemi and Oba Okunade Sijuwade; these monarchs were colossus that redefined the monarchy with touch of diligence, elegance and gravitas that traversed so many cultural boundaries. They were great fathers to me and I will forever miss and honour them.\nI am not coming to the throne to pass judgment on those that have maliciously wronged me. But then, I should think that a bid to be enthroned as the foremost Oba in Yoruba race should be healthy and ordained of God. There is also the Ifa divination that also synthesizes the process, just in case human beings are partial.\nRather, some people resorted to dangerous attacks, wicked lies, malicious insinuations and vigorous campaign of calumny. Why would I fail to forgive them when all came to nought and the good people and governments of Ife and State of Osun saw through these unfair games and chose me as the prestigious Ooni of Ife.\nTherefore, I am coming to set a good example and show the world that I am truly called by God to lead Ile-Ife into a state of tranquillity, conscientiousness and prosperity. It is my fervent prayer that the Lord will continue to guide us all and bestow us with great wisdom to carry out our incumbent tasks. I use this opportunity to call on all the sons of Ile-Ife that were alongside me in the race for the stool to heed to my call and let’s work harmoniously to align our goals for the sake of posterity and Ile-Ife. Together we shall not lose sight of the values and tradition that have made us the greatest nation of black people on earth. I come before you all today as a man pledging his unwavering commitment to his Kingdom and his people that I cannot do this alone; without you all there is no me “I will serve you all with everything I have”. Long live Ile-Ife; long live the Yoruba race, long live the House of Oduduwa, and God Bless the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"http://www.vanguardngr.com/2015/10/the-ile-ife-and-yoruba-of-my-dream-by-ogunwusi-ooni-elect/","2":"3414","3":"Culture","4":"2","5":"en","6":"0.9999904633"},{"0":"Quietness can be an amazing asset, frequently more significant than words.

This is the order of this Court,” Justice Ekwo held.\nThe court equally struck out the name of the 37th plaintiff (Incorporated Trustees of the Nigeria Governors’ Forum) from the suit for lack of locus standi to institute the action.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"https://www.vanguardngr.com/2022/05/36-govs-lose-suit-against-financial-autonomy-for-local-governments/","2":"920","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999904633"},{"0":"News of the Chief of Defence Staff, General Christopher Musa overthrowing the administration of President Bola Tinubu has been described as false.\nThis clarification was made by former Aviation Minister, Femi Fani-Kayode.\nFani-Kayode also said President Bola Tinubu will not fall for such claims that his Minister of State of Defence, Bello Matawalle, are planning to overthrow him and install a military regime.\nPosting on X, the All Progressives Congress, APC, chieftain said the video was aimed at getting Tinubu to sack some of his best appointees.\nHe said, “Now come the devious and vicious lies presented in a malevolent, morbid and well-orchestrated campaign of calumny and disinformation designed to engender suspicion, fear, division and panic in our ranks.\n“A situation whereby fake stories and doctored videos are being peddled all over social media claiming that the Chief of Defence Staff, General Christopher Musa, is poised to take over the reigns of Government and become Head of State and that the Minister of State of Defence, Bello Matawalle, is spying for and collaborating with the military Government of Niger Republic to topple the Tinubu administration clearly reflects the fact that the intention of those that are peddling such egregious and nonsensical falsehood is to sow division within the Government and mislead the President into firing some of his best, most trusted, most vocal and most loyal hands with a view to weakening him and making him vulnerable.\n“This is a dummy that President Tinubu must not fall for.”\nAllNews.ng recalls that a nationwide #EndBadGovernance protest began on Thursday, August 1 and will end on Saturday, August 10, 2024 according to the organisers.\nThe protest which started last week Thursday as at Tuesday is in its sixth day.\nDespite President Bola Tinubu's nationwide on Sunday, protesters still defiantly continued their protest.\nThe protests which had been largely peaceful in some south west states has been violent in the North especially Kano, Kaduna, Katsina and otjer states.\nAlso, it was reported that on Sunday and Monday some of the protesters in some noethern8syates were waving the Russian flag and calling on the Nigerian military to overthrow the government.\nHowever the Russian Embassy has debunked having anything to do with the protests.\nAlso, the Chief of Defence Staff, General Musa has restated that the Nigerian military will defend Nigeria's democracy.","1":"https://allnews.ng/news/sheikh-habeebullah-adam-al-ilory-is-an-olodo-says-saheed-shittu-videoYes","2":"522","3":"Religion","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999046326"},{"0":"By Efe Onadjae\nGovernorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, Lagos, Dr.Olajide Adediran, popularly called Jandor, has challenged the incumbent Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu of the state to prove that he is medically fit to continue to govern the state by engaging in a road walk across the political wards.\nAdediran made the remark while addressing some of his supporters at Carter Street, Ebute Metta, Yaba on Saturday.\nThe PDP governorship candidate maintained that it is through the fitness walk that the people could assess Sanwo-Olu if he has the physical and mental health to continue to govern the state.\nAdediran, who addressed the Council of Arewa Chiefs in the palace of the Sarkin Hausawa of Lagos state, urged the people to unite in voting out the All Progressives Congress, APC, adding that they cannot be intimidated to vote against their choice on election day.\nHe said that he was aware of the challenges the Arewa community faces in the state, promising to create enabling environment for the growth of their businesses.\nAdediran said that the state government’s ban on motorcycle was counterproductive as the government did not provide an alternative source of income for the operators, condemning the profiling of a particular ethnic as criminals who used motorcycle to commit crime.\nAccording to him, “It is wrong for the government to conclude that your people use motorcycles to commit crime. There are criminals among all ethnic groups in Lagos, it is not peculiar to your people.\n“If I become Governor, instead of me to ban, I will rather sit with the Sarkins and discuss how we could fish out the bad eggs among the riders and purnish them rather than taking their source of livelihood.\n“The APC government does not appreciate your economic contribution to the state that is why the governor decided to ban motocyle without creating alternative source of income for you people.\n“I can assure you that my government will not operate like their own. We shall sit and discuss wayout in curbing the menace.\n“If I become Governor, the Arewa community will have more appointment slots unlike now that they give one slot to you people despite living in the state for almost 30 years.”\nMeanwhile, the Waziri of Shuwa-Arabs, Shiek Adam Muhammed, in his remarks, urged the PDP candidate to carry them along in his government if elected, asking what would be their benefits if they support him.\nMuhammed, however, requested on behalf of the Arewa community for five commissioner slots and 57 councillors slots.\nSimilarly, the PDP governorship candidate visited the leadership of Christian Association of Nigeria, CAN, Lagos Mainland Chapter, where he explained part of his manifestoes to them.\nAdediran said that he would tackle insecurity and ensure the safety of residents regardless of their religion, tribe and colour, adding that the excesses of the members of the transport unions would be curtailed in such a way they would channel their energy to a productive venture.\nThe PDP guber candidate said, “My government will not tolerate the nonsense the NURTW members are doing in the state. I can tell you that the transport unionists are misbehaving because they have the backing of the state government.\n“I can tell you that if the state government wants to stop it, it will be stopped, but because the union has become tool in the hand of the government, the governor will not like to curtail their excesses.\n“Yes, NURTW is a registered labour union under Nigerian Labour Congress but I will reorganise it to serve its statutory purpose and use them to address traffic crimes.”\nThe clergy men, who spoke on behalf of the leaders, urged Adediran to carry them along in his government if elected, lamenting that the body had always been sidelined for years.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"https://www.vanguardngr.com/2022/11/jandor-challenges-sanwo-olu-to-fitness-walk/","2":"852","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999866486"},{"0":"President Goodluck Jonathan on Tuesday said there was no need for the Academic Staff Union of Universities to continue with their industrial action.\nJonathan said this at the inauguration of the Federal Government sponsored-Transformation Projects at the Federal University of Technology, Owerri (FUTO).\nRepresented by Prof. Ruqayyat Rufai, the Minister of Education, the president said N30 billion had been released for the payment of earned allowances in all public universities.\nThe president said that the inaugurated projects were in line with the Federal Government’s commitment to providing quality education in the country.\nHe said the projects were based on the need assessment exercise conducted by the Federal Government in universities.\nJonathan urged the university administration to engage in research for national development, while stressing the need for proper maintenance of completed projects.\nThe Vice Chancellor, Prof. Chidozie Asiabaka, in his speech, expressed joy at the completion of the structure.\nAsiabaka noted that the projects had gone a long way in tackling the dearth of basic infrastructure in the school.\n“The dearth of classrooms, lecture theatres, power supply, student hostels, office accommodation, library space and facilities are major challenges my administration faced when I assumed office two years-ago,’’ he said.\nThe vice chancellor said with the intervention of the Tertiary Education Trust Fund, the university got 1000 sitting-capacity lecture theatre, Centre for Entrepreneurial Studies Building.\nHe said the inaugurated projects are the new Engineering Technology, School of Environmental Technology Building, Centre for Nuclear Energy Studies and Training and the School of Agriculture and Agricultural Technology building complexes.\nThe others are the School of Environmental Technology building, landscaping of the campus and the provision of solar energy lights on the campus.\nHe also commended the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) on the completion of the giant student hostel building in the university.\nHe lauded the Federal Government for the release of N1 billion for the development of capital projects in each public funded university.

However the Peoples Democratic Party is treading, cautiously, as a result of the President’s ban on political campaigns ahead of the next general elections.\nPresident Goodluck Jonathan has warned his ministers and officials to resign if they want to participate in the politics of 2015 and some have complied. This disciplined approach to governance is to ensure the administration’s focus is not derailed or dimmed by early politicking for 2015.\nThis is the first time a sitting President would restrict politicking to a specific period to allow the government-in-power to concentrate on governance without distraction. In previous civilian regimes, politics and campaigns for the next elections take off immediately the government in-power is sworn-in. And this is the one of the disadvantages of the double tenure system as against the six year single tenure which Jonathan proposed in 2011. This fine proposal was killed by the National Assembly especially the Tambuwal-led House of Representatives which attacks any proposal or bill originating from the presidency.\nThe anti-Jonathan plot is thickening by the day just as the federal administration is scoring high on economy, infrastructures, security, education and good governance.\nBut the plot will crumble like a pack of cards because it is the people who will elect their President, not Tambuwal and definitely not the new messiah of south-west politics. And of course not Prof Ango Abdullai, the chairman of the Northern Elders Forum who just threatened that the North will not accept Jonathan as President in 2015. I did not expect anything less from the Prof who has for long been sidelined in northern politics and only ascended into his political eldorado recently.\nIt is unfortunate that the professor has never commented on the lack of education in northern Nigeria. About a forthright ago, the Director General of the Nigerian Teachers Institute (NTI), Kaduna, Dr. Aminu Ladan Sharehu said less than 20% of teachers in the North are qualified to teach. This means more than 80% of teachers in the North are themselves illiterates with mainly certificates in Islamic Studies.\nThe figures on education in the North are mind-boggling. Before the Boko Haram insurgency, 10 million school age children were already out of school in northern Nigeria alone. With the recent wanton wastage of the lives of pupils/students in Yobe State and other Boko Haram states in the North, the withdrawal from school will almost double.\nIn 2010, Adamu Ciroma and his associates tried all the tricks in their political bag but Jonathan won in all the geopolitical zones including Katsina State which is the home state of his main opponent. That same year, many associations sprang up aiming to defeat GEJ at the polls,but they all failed because of Jonathan’s promises and candidacy. Today, Nigeria is better for it as GEJ is on course in his efforts to take Nigeria out of the woods. A critical look at the President’s transformation agenda showed that out of the 14 points-program he has achieved reverberating success in sight.\nOur GDP has recorded encouraging growth and this has stabilized our exchange rate at between N150 to N160 per dollar. In May 2011 our inflation rate was 12.4 percent but today it is about 9.1%. The domino effect of this on the economy is inestimable.\nOur external reserve also rose from $38.08bn in May 2011 to #48.4bn in May 2013. Our External Crude Account (ECA) went from $4bn in May 2011 to $9bn in December 2012 and in May 2013 we recorded $6bn. This is because our projected crude oil production fell from the 2.53 million bdp to between 2.1 and 2.2mn bpd. Government annual borrowing was also drastically reduced from N852bn in 2011 to N588bn in May 2013.\nThe Jonathan administration is working to earn international trust and confidence and this has made Nigeria the highest foreign investment destination in Africa with $7bn Foreign Direct Investment. Many foreign investors have openly praised the Goodluck Ebele Jonathan administration due to his transparence and absence of covert and personal pre-agreement conditionalities and kickbacks as in some previous regimes.\nIn agriculture, the administration blocked loopholes in the procurement and distribution of fertilizer.\nOn rail and road transportation, the Jonathan administration has made giant strides. These were infrastructural facilities that were pronounced DEAD, but it resuscitated them.\nIn the road sector government has made Nigerians proud with the refurbishment of the Lagos-Ore-Benin Road, Kano-Maiduguri Road, Abuja-Kaduna-Kano Road. Even most of the eastern roads which were hitherto gullies are now pleasurably motorable. The much publicized East-West trans state road linking the West with the East is also progressing as planned.\nPetrol queues have vanished. The usually quarterly deregulation tango is now a thing of the past.\nElectricity has improved. And the President is not losing focus as electricity will be one of his legacies.\nMany Nigerians are impressed with the President’s handling of the Boko Haram issue. A few critics have lambasted Jonathan for handling the insurgency with kid gloves instead of using the bulldozer approach which leveled Odi on Nov. 20, 1999.\nThe North has never hidden its disdain for the right of southerners to govern this country. From 1957, the North ruled Nigeria till 1999 apart from Gen. Obasanjo’s three years military rule. The North after ruling for 38 years now felt very sorry for the South and ceded power to the South-west due to Obasanjo’s support for President Shehu Shagari in the 1983 122/3 saga that nailed Chief Obafemi Awolowo’s ambition to make Nigeria a nation to be reckoned with in the comity of advanced nations. And so the North has ruled Nigeria for 41 years while the South in 2013 has ruled for only 15 years from 1957.\nThe North will still vote the President into power inspite of the Ango Abdullais and the now sidelined Adamu Ciromas.\nJonathan may not be a strong, military, bulldozing President but nothing will deprive him of his constitutional right to contest the 2015 presidential election.\nHe will run for the presidency in 2015 and there will be no “shaking” about this by the special grace of GOD.\n*Nanaghan lives in Lagos.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"http://www.vanguardngr.com/2013/07/run-jonathan-run","2":"1386","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999885559"},{"0":"Director of Radio Biafra and Leader, Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu as he appeared before Justice Ahmed Mohammed Federal High Court, Abuja on Wednesday, 23/12/2015\nBy Chinedu Adonu\nENUGU- INDIGENOUS People of Biafra (IPOB) condemned British Government for seeking the death of leader of IPOB, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu and that she was an accessory to the genocide on Biafrans.\nIPOB also said that it has classified classified information which incontrovertibly placed the British Government as an accessory to genocide on Biafrans.\nThis came as it accused the British Government and President Muhammed Buhari of plan to administer a non-traceable poison on the leader of IPOB, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu to kill him.\nIPOB confirmed that the British Government is working in tandem with the Nigerian government to stealthily administer a non-traceable poison on the leader of IPOB, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu.\nAcording the press statement signed by IPOB spokesmen Barr. Emma Powrful and Dr. Cliford Chukwuemeka Iroanya, released to journalist in Enugu disclosed that Buhari and British Govornment want to kill Nnamdi Kanu to stop the leaking of heinous crime committed by them.\n“Our intelligence gathering team revealed that one of the reasons for embarking on this heinous crime by both the British Government and the President Buhari is to stop the avalanche of leaked videos and some classified information which incontrovertibly placed the British Government as an accessory to genocide on Biafrans.\n“Another reason is to ensure that Nnamdi Kanu is dead before Mr. Donald J. Trump takes over as the 45th President of the USA. We have also confirmed that should the plan to poison Nnamdi Kanu fail, a phantom road accident will be arranged for the vehicle conveying Nnamdi Kanu to court on any of the court days beginning from Tuesday, 10th of January 2017.\n“What bothers us in IPOB is the fact that Biafrans are Christians and a sizeable proportion of whom are Anglican denomination including the parents of Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, which was where they baptised and christened him “Kenneth or Kenny” for short.\n“So as a child and in accordance with Anglican prayer book Nnamdi Kanu grew up praying for the safety and well being of Queen Elizabeth II, Prince Charles and all their heirs. But the question we ask the British Government is this”. IPOB said.\n“Why would Britain, a supposedly Christian country and a proclaimed member of the body of Christ, be supporting people of Islamic faith such as Buhari to kill Biafrans and enthrone servitude in Biafraland?\nFrom where is this British Government hatred on fellow Christians of Biafran descent coming? Perhaps, the British Government must tell the world what we, Biafrans, did to them that makes them hate us so much”. IPOB question.\n“Is it because we accepted Christianity that they see us as inferior beings or is it the fact that we have English names that made them see us as people without a proud identity? Even the undersigned of this press release still bear their English names and append same on all documents both personal and corporate.\n“Why would the British Government want Nnamdi Kanu dead in spite of the fact that he is a British citizen? Or is it in line with the British Government’s standard practice of hating every African freedom fighter? Recall that both Margaret Thatcher and David Cameron called Nelson Mandela a terrorist and demanded he should be hanged.\n“In like manner, the British Government is now pushing for Nnamdi Kanu to be jailed.\nThis hatred for African freedom fighters, especially those of the Christian faith, by the British Government is very surprising considering that these are Africans who willingly accepted Christianity.\n“What is it in Islam that the British Government discovered which makes them abandon their fellow Christians and connive with Muslims to oppress and kill these Christians on a continual basis?\n“We would like to use this opportunity to caution the British Government to retrace their steps and terminate their plans to kill Mazi Nnamdi Kanu. We are also putting the world on notice that should anything happen to Nnamdi Kanu or those detained with him and elsewhere in Nigeria, the British Government shall be held directly responsible for their deaths. We reassure the world that the restoration of the nation of Biafra is a divine project whose time has come.\n“Both Muhammadu Buhari and the Biafra-hating British Government are incapable of stopping the restoration of the nation of Biafra and 2017 is the year that kick-starts the restoration process. To stop the restoration of the nation of Biafra, the British Government will have to kill over 70 million Biafrans who have sworn to restore their God-given nation.\n“We reiterate that the sovereignty of the nation of Biafra is not negotiable, come rain or shine”.

In John 2:19-21, Jesus said, “Destroy this temple and in three days I will raise it up.”1 The Jews, therefore, said, ‘It took forty-six years to build this temple, and will you raise it up in three days?’ But He was speaking of the temple of his body.” Jesus prophesied that He would rise from the dead in the very body in which He died. Right now, in heaven, Jesus has a physical body. He has scars on his wrists, ankles, brow, and side. He has retained the wounds of His crucifixion.\nAfter His resurrection, He appeared to Thomas. “Then He said to Thomas, ‘Reach here your finger, and see My hands; and reach here your hand, and put it into My side; and be not unbelieving, but believing,'” (John 10:27). Notice that Jesus still retained the hole in His side where he was pierced. “But one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and immediately there came out blood and water,” (John 19:34).\nSome scholars think that when Jesus appeared to the disciples on the road to Emmaus in Luke 24:13-35 and that the reason they did not recognize Him was that Jesus had been beaten about the face, and His beard had been ripped from His face and was simply not recognizable. It wasn’t until after He broke bread and exposed His wrists that they then saw who He was; but, this is just a theory.\nThough He was raised physically, His body was a glorified body. It was the same body, but it was different. 1 Cor. 15:42-44 says, “So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown a perishable body, it is raised an imperishable body; 43 it is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory; it is sown in weakness, it is raised in power; 44 it is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body. If there is a natural body, there is also a spiritual body.”\nWe do not know exactly what a resurrected body is capable of doing; but, Jesus did appear in rooms unannounced. Perhaps we might have the same ability at our resurrection.\nThe physical resurrection of Jesus is a very important doctrine. 1 Cor. 15:14 says, “and if Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is vain, your faith also is vain.” The reason it is so important is that Jesus’ physical resurrection is the proof that death has been conquered and that we too will be physically resurrected. To say that Jesus did not rise from the dead is to say that death had victory over Him. If that were so, we would be without hope; and sin would still have its power.\n1 Cor. 15:53-57, “For this perishable must put on the imperishable, and this mortal must put on immortality. 54 But when this perishable will have put on the imperishable, and this mortal will have put on immortality, then will come about the saying that is written, “Death is swallowed up in victory. 55 “O death, where is your victory? O death, where is your sting?” 56 The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law; 57 but thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.”","1":"http://ow.ly/21Gt50N92n5","2":"744","3":"Religion","4":"2","5":"en","6":"0.999994278"},{"0":"Shagari…Nigeria under his watch\nGen. Olusegun Obasanjo, who handed over the reins of power to the late Alhaji Shehu Shagari, in his book, Not My Will, said Shagari was pushed into power by those who wanted to use him “and he was unfortunately too weak, and somewhat ill-prepared for the trappings of political power to check the abuses of his power by those who made use of him”. Africa Today Publisher KAYODE SOYINKA, in this special piece for The Nation, examines the Shagari Presidency.\nFROM THE ONSET, ALHAJI SHEHU SHAGARI, who won the 1979 Presidential election, although the verdict was controversial, never gave the impression of being a man who had clear idea of what government was all about. If anything, he appeared to be the reincarnation of Prime Minister Abubakar Tafawa Balewa: purposeless, weak, and even to some, lazy – characteristics not surprising in a man who, after all, had never courted power and wanted only to be a senator.\nIn the way he operated and performed as president of Nigeria, it was clear that what President Shagari found most attractive was the pomp and pageantry that came with leadership. General Olusegun Obasanjo, who handed over the reins of power to him, said of him, in his book, Not My Will: “He was pushed into power by those who wanted to make use of him and he was unfortunately too weak, and somewhat ill-prepared for the trappings of political power to check the abuses of his power by those who made use of him”. Shagari himself later demonstrated his lack of confidence in government when he made his famous remark to the effect that, in reality, there were only two major political parties in Nigeria during the Second Republic: the civilians on the one hand and the military on the other.\nBecause he inherited a healthy economy and because, like former Head of State, General Yakubu Gowon, the oil boom really was a real boon for him, Shagari saw his problem not as earning money for the country, but as not knowing what to do with it.\nWhen he came to power October 1, 1979, the price of oil was $40 per barrel on average and the production level was two million barrels per day throughout 1980 and the beginning of 1981. The price of oil had jumped from about $14 per barrel in the third quarter of 1979 to $40 per barrel in the first quarter of 1980. In 1979/80 Nigeria’s revenue was estimated at N12.272 billion (about £9 billion), to which oil contributed about N9.489 billion (£7.6 billion).\nPolitically, in the first two years of his administration, Shagari enjoyed reasonable amount of goodwill. His ruling National Party of Nigeria (NPN), which called for a government of national unity, succeeded in getting Dr Nnamdi Azikiwe’s Nigerian Peoples Party (NPP) to join it to form a government. This relative support and goodwill, which Shagari received from the electorate, despite legal arguments in court about the validity of his victory at the poll, was partly due to the Nigerian people being genuinely fed up with the military rule of the past 13 years and wanting to give civilian rule a chance. Unfortunately, it turned out that Shagari, despite all the years he had spent in the country’s public service, both as a senior politician and in government, with several key ministerial feathers in his cap, really had little inkling of modern politics and economics.\nLacking a sense of history or of Nigeria’s destiny, the Shagari government threw overboard the cost-cutting measures of its predecessor and began to wallow in profligacy. “The financial recklessness of federal and state governments inevitably resulted in the depletion of an already low revenue (resulting from a fall in oil production and price of crude), high debts, inflation, unemployment, factory shut-downs, food scarcity and general disenchantment,” wrote Nigerian commentator Ray Ekpu in the October 1984 edition of Africa Now.\nIn short, Shagari’s NPN government of October 1, 1979, to December 31, 1983, was the epitome of political and economic mismanagement in Nigeria of that era – a government that had killed the country’s economy and politics in its first four-year term. What made matters totally hopeless was that the government engineered an incredible elections fraud in 1983 to ensure his re-election.\nIt was no surprise therefore when Nigerians woke up on the last day of the year 1983 to discover that Shagari’s government had been swept away, there were few mourners. The new military government of General Muhammadu Buhari needed no great oratory to convince Nigerians that the fallen government had been a monumental disaster; almost everyone, except for a few party faithful who profited from the decadence, had felt the rottenness of the government in his bones. As the soldiers broke open warehouses and stores of essential commodities, rice, milk, sugar, cooking oil came tumbling out in large quantities and Nigerians began to dance in the hope that an era had come when such commodities would be both available and affordable.\nEven in the last period of his reign, luck was still on Shagari’s side. It had been said that a certain section of the military actually contemplated removing his government as early as March 1980, but that wiser counsel prevailed, namely that the 1983 elections should be allowed to go ahead. What happened during those elections finally provided enough justification for the removal of the government. In his second coming, Shagari provided further evidence of his lack of will and direction. To say that the massive corruption by members of his party and government was the reason for the New Year coup is to miss the point; that was just the symptoms of the cancer that was killing the country. Shagari was just an inept leader and uninformed.\nWrote Dr Ibrahim Gambari, Nigeria’s Foreign Minister under General Buhari: “The issue of large-scale corruption severely damaged the reputation of the operators of the political system. Although this was not a new issue in Nigeria, the nature of the new presidential system and the increase in oil-based revenue accruing to the federal and state governments, especially in the early 1980s, helped to elevate corruption to new heights. Corrupt practices became pervasive at local, state and federal levels, especially in the award of contracts and the manipulation of the import-licensing system. When these practices continued without much regard to declining government revenue, they poisoned the social and political climate, since ever fewer funds were made available to maintain, let alone develop, social services and related institutions. It was not long before essential medical services and the educational systems degenerated and were on the verge of collapse. Social tensions were heightened and antisocial behaviour of the underclass increased very rapidly.”\nDr Gambari, in his book, Theory and Reality in Foreign Policy Making: Nigeria After the Second Republic, maintained: “The elections of 1983 were not conducted in an atmosphere of freedom or with fairness. On the contrary, they were accompanied by serious abuses, blatant malpractices and communal violence. In view of the ethnic pattern of support and voting by the general public, the claims of ‘victory’ by one party in the traditional strongholds of the others stretched credibility to the limit and led to outbreaks of violence. The resulting bloodshed and confusion damaged the reputation not only of the law enforcement agencies, which were often part of the problem, but also of the federal government and politicians in general.”\nThis was the situation in Nigeria when, on the eve of the New Year 1983, there was another military coup d’état that removed the Shagari government. It was the fourth successful military takeover in Black Africa’s most dominant power. However, unlike the ones before it, this coup did not come totally as a shock. It was one coup that was self-evident.\nThe decision of the military to govern again on the eve of 1984 was ostensibly a patriotic and altruistic one: to save the country from what they perceived as the monumental scale of corruption and economic depravity in the civilian administration. Even allowing for some measure of sincerity in these intentions, it does not rule out another motivation, rooted in the historical trends, political development, ambitions, and fears extant in post-independence Nigeria: in short, in the on-going North/South geo-ethnic rivalry.\nOne result of the 1967-70 civil war was the de facto establishment of the Northern hegemony within the army’s corps of senior officers who aimed at ensuring that this would be maintained even during a civilian administration. However, the dominance of the North both as a united political entity and, increasingly, over the economy during the military administrations from 1966-79 was being seriously challenged from the South under the civil administration of Shehu Shagari (Northerner though he was).\nWhen the 1983 election result gave Shagari both a second term of office and made his NPN the pre-eminent party, not only in the North but in majority of the Southern states as well, the worst fears of these top-ranking officers were confirmed. They could foresee that in the next presidential elections in four years time, the NPN would fulfil what was written into the party’s constitution, namely: the selection of a presidential candidate from among the faithful in the South. Indeed, the NPN’s Southerners made no attempt to conceal this aim and immediately after the 1983 elections jockeyed for federal positions in Shagari’s new government.\nShagari had consolidated the Northern officer hegemony by encouraging Moslem Hausa/Fulani promotions (in preference to Southerners and Christian Northerners) by making appointments to coveted commands and awards of lucrative contracts to retiring officers of the same ilk. Despite this, a ruthless, single-minded cabal of Northern officers decided that the danger of their power base being eroded by a Southern-dominated administration with mass popular support (probably including that of the junior officers and rank-and-file in the armed forces) far outweighed any loyalty they owed to President Shagari. These were the more compelling reasons why Major-Generals Buhari and Babangida, with nine other senor army and air force officers, laid their plans stealthily and efficiently for the successful coup of December 31, 1983.\nSuccessful though the actual coup undoubtedly was, in order to gain legitimacy, the generals depended heavily on whatever support they could coax from the people. One of the numerous ways they went about this was to arrest former civilian politicians and lock them all up in different jails around the country. Show trials were staged before military tribunals at which they faced charges of corruption – an attempt by the regime to retrieve the ill-gotten gains the politicians had acquired when in government.\nThe Buhari regime put the main blame on the politicians for the ravages on Nigeria’s treasury and on one man in particular: UMARU DIKKO.\nFAILED ATTEMPT TO FIGHT CORRUPTION\nWhen Shagari’s victory at the polls in the 1983 Presidential election had been declared, it was widely expected that he would do something about corruption under his administration. From the beautiful plateau holiday resort, the Yankari Games Reserve, in northern Nigeria where he had been in retreat, Shagari made a speech strongly condemning corruption. The speech came to be known as Shagari’s “Sermon on the Plateau” and it was widely thought that some heads would have to roll among his ministers. All eyes were particularly on Dikko who had by then gained notoriety for his presumed corruption. But only lightweight ministers were eventually sacked from the cabinet. Dikko not only remained in the cabinet, he retained his very powerful political influence, authority and power on the Presidency and government. The New Nigeria, with a characteristically slick paraphrase of a cliché, dubbed the sacking as “The Night of the Short Knives”.\nShagari had set up a Code of Conduct Bureau to, in his own words, “maintain high standards of probity in the conduct of public officials;” he had appointed a special Tribunal of Enquiry into the alleged misappropriation of N2.8 billion from the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) under the Obasanjo regime. But, for all his good intentions, perhaps he should have paid more attention to a famous Islamic reformer of the early 19th century who founded and lived in his own hometown and state of Sokoto and with whose works he was certainly familiar. This was Uthman Dan Fodio whose advice to any Caliph (high in the ruling hierarchy) included: “It is quite likely that it is about his officials that people wish to complain: he must therefore listen to them. If he doesn’t then he can be compared to a herdsman who, rather than guarding his herd, holds the cow (in this case, the people) by the horns to help the thief (his officials) steal the milk (his people’s wealth.)”\nShagari never believed all the accusations of corruption levelled against Dikko or, for that matter, against any of his top ministers. For him to have acted decisively against any minister, he needed cast-iron evidence of that minister’s corruption, which nobody was able to produce. Despite the fact that a minister like Dikko had become increasingly unpopular in the eyes of the people, Shagari found it difficult to drop him from his cabinet. President Shagari trusted his ministers as surely as he trusted his own integrity. As President, his own honesty was never in doubt. He could be compared with Sir Milton Margai, the late Prime Minister of Sierra Leone who, when he died in 1964, owed money to the bank – he left an overdraft. Indeed, as Commissioner for Finance under General Gowon, Shagari himself had sought and obtained an overdraft. The bank manager had actually written asking him when he intended becoming solvent again. If a Nigerian Federal Commissioner for Finance, at the time his country was enjoying an unprecedented oil boom, had incurred an overdraft, which he was having difficulty in settling, surely he must have been an honest man.\nBut Shagari, while he was President, was deluded into trusting people whom others viewed as dishonest. His tragedy was that, had he survived his second term of office, he might have proved that he was his own man instead of being the prisoner of his party, as he undoubtedly was during his first term.\nBut Dikko, his campaign manager in the Presidential election of 1983, is one man who would defend the former president till the last. “Whatever any Nigerian may say, no matter how biased he is, one thing he would have to admit is that Shagari is a good person. He was not a dictator. He is a fair-minded man who meant well for Nigeria. Under his regime, whether or not you voted for him, you were not denied your entitlement as a Nigerian. He did not win in all the states of Nigeria but, despite that, there is no state where they can say they were totally excluded from the affairs of the country. Under Shagari we had the greatest chance in Nigeria, the best opportunity that ever came to us, to be welded into a nation, where you don’t think of yourself as a Yoruba or as Hausa/Fulani or as an Ibo; where you think in terms of belonging to this or that party. That is called advancement, politically. That was the road on which Shagari put Nigeria, only to be treated the way he was treated,” Dikko told me in an interview while in exile in London.\n- This article is adapted from Soyinka’s book: DIPLOMATIC BAGGAGE: MOSSAD & NIGERIA – THE DIKKO STORY.","1":"http://thenationonlineng.net/shagari-nigeria-watch/?utm_source=quora&utm_medium=referral","2":"3366","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999904633"},{"0":"Abuja – General Muhammadu Buhari, the president-elect, has said that he is willing to work with any leader of the Senate, irrespective of what part of the country he or she originates from.\nIn a statement released in Abuja on Wednesday, May 13, General Buhari described as false, insinuations in the media that he was in support of any particular Senator’s emergence as Leader or that he belonged to any camp pushing for the emergence of a leader from a particular part of the country.\n“I am prepared to work with any leaders that the House or Senate selects,” General Buhari said. “It doesn’t matter who the person is or where he or she is from.”\nHe added that these insinuations were probably born out of people’s expectations based on the way things had happened in the past, but reminded Nigerians that CHANGE had truly come.\n“There is due process for the selection of leaders of the National Assembly,” General Buhari said, “and I will not interfere in that process.”\nGeneral Buhari added that the media and the public should begin to get used to no more “business as usual.”\n“Nigeria has indeed entered a new dispensation,” he said. “My administration does not intend to repeat the same mistakes made by previous governments.”\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"http://www.vanguardngr.com/2015/05/buhari-denies-purported-choice-of-senate-leader/","2":"317","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999771118"},{"0":"A Lagos High Court sitting in Ikeja on Friday discharged and acquitted three persons charged for conspiracy and the murder of Bayo Ohu, a political reporter and the Assistant News Editor of the Guardian Newspapers, murdered three years ago in Lagos.\nThe Lagos State government had accused the three men of conspiracy and the murder of Ohu.\nThe accused are Dada Yemi Adesanya, Ganiu Sulemon and Idris Balogun.\nThe Lagos State government which prosecuted the case had alleged that on the 20th of September 2009 at NO 9 Oyeniji Street, in Odukoya estate, Akowonjo Egbeda area in the Ikeja judicial division, the three men armed with offensive weapons robbed Ohu of one laptop computer and two mobile telephone sets.\nThe men were also alleged to have murdered Ohu in the process of robbing him of his belongings.\nRuling on a no case submission filed by the defence counsel, Yemi Omodele, the presiding judge, Justice Lateefa Okunnu held that the prosecution failed to prove its case against the men beyond reasonable doubt.\nThe court stated that no evidence whatsoever was placed before the court to show that the defendants were at the scene of the alleged crime.\nJustice Okunu observed that none of the police officers listed before the court as witnesses came to testify saying “they abandoned the case and did not turn up”.\nThe court further held that there was no correlation in the evidence of the first prosecution witness, Kashi Taiwo and that of Bode Adetola, the 2nd prosecution witness, to show that the defendants were the persons that killed Ohu.\nWhat the prosecution had against the accused person according to the court was at best ‘mere suspicion which goes to no issue’.\nThe court subsequently discharged the accused persons.\nOhu was shot and killed at his home in Lagos, on the morning of Sunday, September 20, 2009.

A feeling of déjà vu has engulfed the polity. Public funds had been wasted, misappropriated or embezzled.\nInvestigations had also been conducted and reports of indictment made public. Same arms of government had always traded claims, but, this time, the number two citizen of the country and the lower chamber of the national parliament are the dramatis personae.\nThe first segment of the face-off was between a former Secretary to the Government of the Federation, SGF, Mr Babachir Lawal, and the Senate. Senators had launched an investigation into the expenditures of the Presidential Initiative in the North East (PINE) and alleged a fraud of over N200 million said to have been perpetrated by Lawal in a grass cutting contract for the Boko Haram ravaged North-East and recommended his sack.\nBut the Executive arm of government pooh-poohed the recommendation. The development led to a verbal exchange between Lawal and then Senator Shehu Sani-led investigative committee. It was not until the exchange became a public embarrassment for the federal administration that the Presidency set up a committee, headed by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, to further investigate Lawal.\nThough the report of that investigation was not made public, President Muhammadu Buhari eventually fired the SGF.\nAbout one year after the incident, Osinbajo, a professor of law and pastor, is at the centre of another corruption allegation. This time, it is about the approval of N5.8billion for various humanitarian exigencies in the North-East. Also fingered in the corruption allegation is the Director-General of the National Emergency Management Agency, NEMA, Mr. Mustapha Maihaja, who has been accused of failure to account for over N33billion. Osinbajo and Maihaja are battling to extricate themselves from the accusations concerning the funds totalling N39.8billion.\nAnd like the Lawal/Senate face-off which the upper chamber pronounced on, the VP and the NEMA DG’s fate was decided by the House of Representatives Committee on Disaster Preparedness and Emergency which had launched investigation into NEMA’s activities in the North-East. The Committee was headed by Hon. Ali Isa representing Balanga/Biliri Federal Constituency of Gombe State.\nOrdinarily, Osinbajo would have had no business in the episode were it not for the health challenges of Buhari that took him away for most of 2017. During the period, the VP acted as President and the emergency situation in the North-East arose. Osinbajo did what he thought was legally and administratively expedient. But in the eyes of the federal lawmakers, then Acting President erred in law as Isa said he has questions to answer.\nAt Thursday’s plenary, the House considered the report and recommendations of the Isa Committee and agreed that the VP actually erred.\nThe House recalled that the sum of N5, 865, 671, 939.26 was approved and released in June 2017 via a memo raised by the Office of the Vice President, directing then Minister of Finance, Mrs. Kemi Adeosun, and the Accountant General of the Federation to so act on the emergency intervention of food security to the North-East to support the population ravaged by insurgency.\nThe memo further specified a directive to the Governor of the CBN, Mr. Godwin Emefile, from the Ministry of Finance to pay the sum from the Consolidated Revenue Fund Account which the AGF was to raise a mandate for.\nBut the House said that this was in contravention of the approval of the National Assembly on the issuance of Euro Bond from which then Minister authorized the payment.\nAccording to the lawmakers, the Euro Bond is for specified infrastructural projects and not for discretionary intervention, adding that there was no specific appropriation by the National Assembly.\nSection 80 (4) of the 1999 Constitution, as amended, states, “No money shall be withdrawn from the Consolidated Revenue Fund or any other public fund of the Federation, except in the manner prescribed by the National Assembly”.\nRelying on the constitutional provision, the House pointed out that the money, paid to six different companies for the supply of food items to the North-East, was not approved by the federal parliament.\nSame day, the House adopted the recommendation of the Committee that the NEMA DG should be relieved of his duties for the alleged loss of N33 billion and violation of public trust.\nThe House also mandated the anti-graft agencies to further investigate the DG and apply appropriate sanctions where necessary.\nThe areas where Maihaja was allegedly found culpable include the issue of the donation of 6,779 metric tons of rice by the Chinese government to IDPs in the North-East; the issue of the receipt and utilization of N1.6 billion for flood victims in 16 states; the issue of the funds released for emergency intervention of food security in the North-East and the issue of the release of N3,153, 000, 000 to NEMA for food intervention in the region.\nOthers are on the matter concerning the evacuation of Nigerians from Libya and the question of the unaccounted N17, 889, 050, 401 released from the Ecological Fund to NEMA.\nOn the issue of the donation of 6,779 metric tons of rice by the Chinese government to IDPs, the Committee made the following recommendations:\n* That the House condemns in strong terms the negligence and inefficiency of the Ministry of Budget and National Planning and NEMA for the long delay in the collection of the rice from the port terminal.\n*That NEMA and the Federal Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Budget and National Planning should account for the rice which was never received by the beneficiaries.\n* That the ICPC, the EFCC and the Nigeria Police should conduct further investigation and prosecute where necessary.\n* That the ICPC, the EFCC and the police should ensure the recovery of about N800m paid as demurrage from the concerned officers of the Ministry of Budget and National Planning, Ministry of Agriculture and NEMA while they should further investigate the conflicting testimonies of the agencies and determine whether there was multiple payment for the demurrage.\n* That the suspension of six staff members of NEMA by its management is an abuse of power, against the extant public service rules and a gross violation of Section 36 of the 1999 Constitution as amended.\nOn the receipt and utilization of N1.6 billion for flood victims in 16 states, the Committee recommended that the ICPC and the EFCC should further investigate the matter and recover N700m from Maihaja.\nOn the funds released for emergency intervention of food security in the North-East, the Committee indicted government officials involved in the approval, processing, release and diversion of the N5.8billion for the emergency intervention of food security in the North-East, as it contravened S.80(2) and 80(4) of the Constitution and constituted an infraction on due process for the procurement and loss of government revenue and the flouting of the terms of the Eurobond loan, saying relevant security agencies should take steps to recover the money from them.\nOn the release of N3,153, 000, 000 to NEMA for food intervention to the North-East, the Committee stated that the ICPC and the EFCC should recover N1,150, 000, 000 being subsidised cost of 5, 000 metric tons of rice from the Director General of NEMA who claimed to have donated same to the World Food Programme (WFP) when the agency was ready to pay for it or import same.\nOn the matter concerning the evacuation of Nigerians from Libya, the Committee recommended that the Federal Government should make available adequate funds to relevant agencies for their rehabilitation in order to prevent them from going back.\nIt added that the process, procedure, method and cost of the evacuation of the Nigerians stranded abroad was opaque and should be made more transparent in order to ensure better accountability.\nOn the unaccounted N17, 889, 050, 401 released from the Ecological Fund to NEMA, the Committee said the agency should submit, through the appropriate authority, all the money accruing to it yearly to the National Assembly for Appropriation in order to meet constitutional requirements.\nThe Chairman of the Committee, Isa, told the House, “From the investigation, it has been established that the Federal Government lost N33billion as a result of mismanagement or outright embezzlement of funds occasioned by the actions or inactions of the Managing Director of NEMA, Engr. Mustapha Yunusa Maihaja.\n“It is hereby consequently recommended that the Director General of NEMA be relieved of his duties by Mr President and handed over to relevant authorities for prosecution.\nThe controversy on the issues continued outside of the House last week when Ikem Isiekwena of APNA, a political action committee supporting the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC, and believed to be Osinbajo’s associate, defended the Vice President while the National Publicity Secretary of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, Kola Ologbodiyan, and the National Secretary of the Social Democratic Party, Shehu Gabam, took sides with the lawmakers.\nIsiekwena, Ologbodiyan and Gabam spoke on Channels Television Sunrise programme.\nReps indictment of VP is a hatchet job — Ikem Isiekwena\nWhat do you make of the disbursement of the N5.8billon to NEMA?\nI think there is a misconception to start with and it is essentially what you would call a hatchet job because we need to separate facts from fiction or innuendoes. The first point to note is that there was an emergency situation and the law provides for a process, whether by procurement or how money gets disbursed from government coffers, to address the situation.\nNow you have a report which, at best, is haphazard and, at worst, is a ploy to tarnish the image of persons in government. So you find out that what had happened in May 2017 was that there was a food crisis which the United Nations Food Programme said they were unable to deal with, and there was going to be a reduction of food to about 85% of the persons in IDP camps in the North-East; so the administration was confronted with an emergency, how did they deal with it?\nA meeting was convened and the Vice President who, at the time was Acting President, sat with relevant ministries.\nThey had the Ministers of Budget and Planning, Finance, Agriculture and Rural Development and the CBN Governor which constituted a Presidential Committee on Food Security and it was clear that they needed to send 45,000 metric tons of grains to the North-East so that people don’t die of starvation. So it was a people-oriented action taken in good faith and they sat around and, in that meeting room, this report did not indicate, as was eloquently expressed in the House, that the CBN, in the consultations, said we had a price stabilization process where we are in a PPP arrangement with the most renowned agriculture aggregators, Flour Mills, Dangote Rice, etc, and they had grain reserves such that it contained any shocks from pricing.\nSo cumulatively, there were almost 31,000 metric tons of grains. So, there was a pricing system at the time that allowed procurement process in an emergency situation to occur. Now you hear that there is unconstitutionality, illegality which is false.\nYou have the NEMA Act and, if you look at Section 16 Sub-section 2, it clearly specifies the authorizing body for the award of any contract by NEMA in an emergency situation and it is the President and remember that the Vice President, at the time, was the Acting President. So he was acting in accordance with the law and here you also have Section 43 of the Procurement Act which provides that there is a departure from the general bidding process and you can do single sourcing or you can undertake the process that was undertaken in each instance.\nSo Section 43 was followed, Section 16 and Sub-section 2 of the NEMA Act was also followed. Now you have a report that came out and I am shocked that this report specifies that Section 16 of the Procurement Act was infringed. How can there be an infraction of the general principle of law, when there is a specific Section of the law that says in an emergency situation this sort of process that was followed could be followed? So it shows you that it is a hatchet job.\nSo what you are saying is that in the report that the House of Reps put forward, there is no iota of truth anywhere?\nThere is no truth in it. There is something in the report that is tagged branding and packaging.\nYou are not concerned about the fact that accountability is what the legislators are asking for here. The Office of the Vice President stated some of the things that the money was supposedly used for.\nThat is not an extract from the report and it is a bagging process, there was no branding here. It was to bag grains that were in silos and having 707 trucks to deliver the grains from four different locations.\nIn this emergency situation, according to the lawmakers, there was no bidding for any of these jobs that were given out.\nThat is not true, it is inaccurate to say no company bid because the procurement process that was followed under Section 43 of the Public Procurement Act says that in an emergency situation and I told you that before the consultation process started, the CBN identified that we had a grain reserve programme. Where are you going to get 15,000 metric tons of grains from?\nOsinbajo can’t take Nigeria for a banana republic – Ologbodiyan\nDo you agree that it is a hatchet job?\nI do not agree that it is a hatchet job. The young man was acting on behalf of the Vice President and he came to act a script but he failed to deliver on it. Affected state governments were represented at the public hearing.\nThe representative of Yobe State was a Perm Sec and he declared that no grain was received, no intervention was done and I believe that the House of Reps was very thorough both in the public hearing and the report that emanated from the public hearing.\nThe House of Reps consists of 360 members across party lines and not a single objection was heard on the floor of the House. So it is strange for anybody to come and say it was a hatchet job. A hatchet job that the Vice President, as Acting President, did not approve of the N5.8billion as some form of intervention on the food crisis in the North-East? A hatchet job that the money was not expended? I truly do not understand his position.\nHe cited some parts of the Procurement Act which he thinks the members of the House did not look at, particularly Sections 14 and 80 of the Constitution; he believed that the lawmakers did not look at these sections of the law effectively before they came up with this report.\nOne recommendation of the committee is that the action of NEMA, chaired by the VP, contravened the provisions of Sections 82 and 84 of the Constitution and the act constitutes an infraction of due process particularly on procurement and a loss of government revenue, these are the basic issues.\nFor instance, the Chairman of the committee, Hon. Ali Isa, said there was no bidding for contract. Yes, there is a Section of the Procurement Act that says that in an emergency, NEMA can act but the Act doesn’t say that you can go and do contracts without following procurement rules. And so you cannot turn around and say that because it is an emergency you did a contract of N5.8billion without due process, you withdrew money from the Consolidated Account without taking it through the National Assembly? This is not a banana republic, this is country guided by a Constitution and the VP is a professor of law.\nThe Presidency must answer to the issues raised by the House – Gabam\nDo you agree that this is a hatchet job?\nI think we need to understand the processes that are involved in such a very important exercise that touches the lives of people that are stranded. Government has three arms: executive, legislature and judiciary. Lawmakers have an independent way of investigating issues that the executive has addressed. The National Assembly, apart from the Speaker and the Senate President, has Committee Chairmen who function as ministers in their own rights, and they have the powers to investigate and write reports on issues.\nThose investigations do not mean that somebody is being witch-hunted; it is a process of accountability, to ensure that issues of perceptions, allegations are dealt with thoroughly and anybody who has visited IDP camps will come to terms with the reality that the people are desirous of immediate attention at all times because the life they live is very pathetic, it seems that there is no intervention anywhere. So, sometimes, the necessity of what you see creates that desperation especially when the large chunk of the N5.8billion is going into the IDP camps and no result to justify that kind of thing.\nSo, when I look at it from the responsibility of the National Assembly, it is an oversight function of that committee to do a thorough job and we are a government that is governed by laws and we operate within the parameters of laws and I believe that what they are doing is what needs to be done.\nOne of the things the legislators talked about has to do with accountability and Section 16 of the Public Procurement Act talked about processes being carried out with clarity and transparency so that there can be accountability. Do you think they are right in saying that there are questions that need to be answered as regards this emergency situation in the North-East?\nThey are absolutely right; they have the powers to investigate. No President has unlimited powers and as Acting President he had operate within the law and once there is an Act that makes provisions for an emergency situation, there are processes and those processes have to be followed.\nI am not saying there is absolute violation of that process and their investigation is ongoing but I am saying that, as a matter of fact, this should not been seen as a deliberate act to witch-hunt anybody but as process that will explain to Nigerians what happened because issues were raised and perhaps Nigerians are not aware the exercise had taken place until the National Assembly raised it.\nThe Presidency has not explained to Nigerians that they were carrying out this exercise in the overall national interest in an emergency situation. I have been in the executive and I know sometimes how frustrating the executive can be given the situation but at the same time if there is a good relationship between the executive and the National Assembly some of these gaps wouldn’t have been there.\nAnd let us as Nigerians back a process that will take care of future reckless behaviour in terms of managing a process and nobody should feel he is above the law and the law must be complied with at all times.\nWe must allow institutions to function properly and I think the institutions should continue to function properly and if they do as they are supposed to and as lawmakers, they ought to have done this a long time ago, not now at a point election is approaching and it is subject to a lot of interpretations and so on.\nThe National Assembly should be allowed to function properly and Nigerians have the mindset to know whether they are being rational or otherwise and Nigerians should judge at the end of the day. So this is not a pre-emptive exercise in terms of demeaning the process. They have fundamental responsibility backed by law to exercise their oversight function.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"https://www.vanguardngr.com/2018/11/b-haram-survivors-didnt-get-food-on-which-officials-paid-n800m-demurrage/","2":"4182","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999237061"},{"0":"Some of the Dapchi Schoolgirls brought back by their abductors in Dapchi town, alongside their brothers/family members before proceeding To Abuja. Photo by Ndahi Marama.\nThe Federal Government has accused the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) of plumbing the depths of infamy for saying the abduction and release of the Dapchi girls were stage-managed.\nIn a statement issued in Abuja on Thursday, the Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, said such postulation on the Dapchi girls portrays the PDP as an inhuman, insensitive, unpatriotic and unworthy party.\nHe said since the release of the Dapchi girls were negotiated by friendly countries and reputable international organizations, it would have taken a conspiracy of global proportion to have stage-managed the adoption and release of the girls.\nAlhaji Mohammed said the reaction of the PDP amounts to an expression of sour grapes, especially because the party failed woefully – when it was in power – to quickly resolve a similar abduction of schoolgirls.\n”As we have said many times since the abduction of the Dapchi schoolgirls, no government is exempted from its own share of tragedies. What makes the difference is the way such tragedies are managed.\nWhereas it took the PDP all of 18 days to even acknowledge the abduction of the Chibok girls in 2014, the APC Federal Government acted promptly and responsively when the Dapchi schoolgirls were abducted 19 Feb. 2018, hence their quick release,” he said.\nThe Minister said it is unfortunate that the PDP that failed woefully as a ruling party has also failed grievously as an opposition party, going by its insensitive and crude response to the release of the Dapchi schoolgirls – a development that calls for non-partisan celebration.\n”In its 16 years in power, the PDP redefined governance as cluelessness, massive looting of the public treasury and crude exhibition of power. In its over three years in opposition, the PDP has again shown it does not understand the role of the opposition in a democracy. How then can the PDP convince Nigerians that it has learnt its lessons and that it is ready to rule the country again? Nigerians must say ‘never again’ to this primitive and soulless party,” he said.\nAlhaji Mohammed said the Federal Government has not been responding to the amateurish and jejune statements from the PDP precisely because the party has failed to learn the ropes of being an opposition party, ”even when we have advised them to take a crash course on the role of the opposition in a democracy.\n”We broke our own rules this time because the PDP over-reached itself and scored an own goal at a time it could simply have congratulated the government and people of Nigeria on the release of the girls or\njust keep quiet,” he said.\nThe Minister assured Nigerians that the Federal Government will intensify the ongoing efforts to secure the release of the remaining Chibok girls and return them safely to their families, just like over 100\nother Chibok girls who have so far been released, unlike the PDP that could not secure the release of even one of the girls before it was booted out of power\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"https://www.vanguardngr.com/2018/03/dapchi-schoolgirls-fg-says-pdp-plumbs-depth-infamy/","2":"699","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999866486"},{"0":"Senator Abdullahi Adamu\n.As Buhari’s senior aide defends ex-Lagos Gov\nOmeiza Ajayi, Abuja\nFollowing threats by the National Chairman of the ruling All Progressives Congress APC, Senator Abdullahi Adamu to sanction a national leader of the party over remarks considered uncomplimentary against President Muhammadu Buhari, a member of the party’s National Working Committee NWC has said Adamu’s position is not that of the NWC.\nAdamu had on Saturday voiced strong concerns about Tinubu’s outbursts on how he had helped President Muhammadu Buhari to power.\nNational Vice Chairman, Northwest, of the APC, Salihu Moh. Lukman in his reaction said while Adamu has a fight to his personal opinion, he cannot however force down his opinion on other members of the NWC and pass it as the position of the party.\nHe said; “We all including Asiwaju himself acknowledge that it was unfortunate he made those statements and it is his right to express his frustrations. It should be recognized as such. But nobody, no matter the position of the person can use it against him unless the party follows due process through the rightful organs of the party to discuss it.\n“So, the opinion expressed by Abdullahi Adamu was his personal opinion and it is his own right to present it to any organ of the party for consideration, but until that opinion is adopted by the relevant organ of the party, it cannot be considered as the position of party. It is not the position of APC, it is hispersonal opinion personal opinion”, he declared.\nIn a related development, the Senior Special Assistant to President Muhammadu Buhari on Special Duties, Mallam Ya’u Darazo, has risen in defence of Mr Tinubu, over statements credited to the latter that was perceived as insulting to the president.\nDarazo who was present in Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital, where Tinubu addressed party faithful alongside the Ogun State Governor, Dapo Abiodun said the statement was taken out of context to embarrass Tinubu and create disaffection between him and President Buhari.\nThe President’s aide who said he wrote the statement in his personal capacity and as a member of the Tinubu Campaign Organization, said he was convinced that President Buhari can see through the mischief having been a victim of misresprentation and character assassination himself in the past. He noted that the motive of those promoting the narrative that Tinubu insulted Buhari was to destroy the warm relationship between them.\nHe said; “In the last 48 hours or so, the media space has been polluted by the odious breath of mischief makers – nay ingrates who mispresented Asiwaju’s speech with the sole aim of planting discord between him and President Muhammadu Buhari. In their mischievous minds, that would earn them added advantage in the primaries for the Ticket of the APC.\n“I have a message for them. They have failed woefully. They should not take Nigerians for granted; Nigerians are wise enough. Let the mischief makers note that good and purposeful leadership is not on the same page with mischief. It is good that Nigerians know them early enough. It is very clear that their purpose of seeking leadership is not service driven.\n“I was with Asiwaju in Abeokuta among other good people of Ogun State when he delivered the speech in question. It was in Yoruba Language. It was later translated to me—which I found quite acceptable and politically relevant to the audience and even beyond. Truth is sacred. If the mischief makers think that by mispresenting Asiwaju’s statement they will get the sympathy of the President; they have failed again—and failed woefully.\n“President Buhari is not a stranger to the bashing of media mischief. He is a veteran. He passed through it. He suffered from it like no other leader in this country. When he sees media mischief, he would know it; certainly, like this one against Asiwaju.”\nGoing down memory lane, Darazo recalled previous attempts to unfairly misrepresent Buhari and damage him politically.\nHe advised President Buhari who had been a victim not to be swayed by antics of mischief makers bent on undermining Tinubu’s ambition.\n“They are very active members of the PDP and are opposing all what President Buhari stood for.\n“These powerful elements are said to have recruited agents within the APC to do two projects for them. Ensure that APC produces a weak candidate that will give PDP a walkover. Secondly, to ensure APC produces a Northern candidate so that they will turn round and accuse the President as a Northern irredentist who denied shift of power to the South”, he explained.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"https://www.vanguardngr.com/2022/06/tinubu-its-your-personal-opinion-nwc-member-fires-back-at-adamu/","2":"1056","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999465942"},{"0":"Gunmen kill Ebubeagu operative, set body ablaze in Ebonyi\nGunmen have killed a member of Ebubeagu Security Network in Ebonyi State.\nThe victim, Ifeanyi Orogbowhow, 32, was murdered and partially burnt by the attackers.\nThe incident occurred at night in Igweledeoha, Amagu in Ikwo Local Government Area.\nThe murder took place at a drinking joint in the community owned by the victim.\nPolice spokesperson, Loveth Odah, confirmed the incident.\nShe said: “The DPO of Ikwo police division said that at about 3:am he received a phone call from one source at Igweledeoha Amagu Ikwo that one Ebubeagu security outfit, Ifeanyi Orogbo, aged 32 years old an indigene of Igweledeoha was murdered and partially burnt by unknown persons in his beer parlour shop along Eke Achara, Agubia road.\n“The DPO said as he received the information, he quickly mobilised a team of police operatives to the area but the culprits had deserted the area.\n“He said the corpse has been taken to general hospital for preservation and autopsy.”\nThe spokesperson said two persons suspected to be involved in the murder of the Ebubeagu official have been arrested by the police.\nShe said the Commissioner of Police, Garba Aliyu, has expressed dismay over the killing of the Ebubeagu operative and has vowed to bring the perpetrators to book.","1":"https://thenationonlineng.net/gunmen-kill-ebubeagu-operative-set-body-ablaze-in-ebonyi/","2":"322","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9998188019"},{"0":"…Insists he’s threat to national security\n…As court reserves ruling on request to stay execution of judgement\nBy Ikechukwu Nnochiri\nThe Federal Government yesterday adduced reasons it has not obeyed the judgement of the Court of Appeal that ordered the release of leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, Nnamdi Kanu, from detention.\nGovernment in a fresh affidavit filed before the Abuja Division of the Court of Appeal, maintained that Kanu posed a flight risk, insisting he would escape from the country as soon as he was freed from detention.\nThe affidavit was attached in support of an application seeking to stay the execution of the appellate court verdict that quashed the entire 15-count terrorism charge the federal government preferred against the embattled IPOB leader.\nArguing the application yesterday, an Assistant State Counsel in the office of the Attorney-General of the Federation, Mr. David Kaswe, told the court that the case against Kanu bordered on national security.\nKaswe argued that Kanu’s fundamental rights should not supercede the interest of the nation.\nRelying on the decided case law in Federal Republic of Nigeria Vs Asari Dokubo, the federal government argued that once a case touched on national security, the right of the individual affected took secondary place.\n“It is important to appreciate the gamut of depositions in our application. The Respondent is a flight risk person and one of the ground of our application is that this matter touches on national security of the state.\n“We further rely on the case of FRN Vs Dokubo, where the Supreme Court held that where national security is threatened or when there is likelihood of it being threatened, human rights take secondary place.\n“Once there is a threat to national security, human rights of any individual can be suspended until such threat is taken care of.\n“Once security of the nation is in jeopardy, the individual right may not even exist,” government’s lawyer argued.\nBesides, he told the court that intelligence report in government’s possession indicated that releasing the IPOB leader from detention would worsen the security situation in the South East.\n“The defendant has shown that he has the capacity to jump bail or to escape from lawful custody. There is reasonable intelligence that the enforcement of judgement of this court, pending determination of our appeal at the Supreme Court, may impact negatively on the declining security in the South East.\n“No court can close its eyes on activities happening around it. As we speak, the entire social media is awash with threat to security in the country.\n“We believe that there is an exceptional circumstance to warrant this court to grant our application.\n“We urge this court to resolve the sole issue we raised and find our application meritorious, in the interest of justice and unity of the country,” federal government’s lawyer added.\nHowever, Kanu’s lawyer, Mike Ozekhome, SAN, urged the appellate court to dismiss FG’s application which he said was tantamount to seeking the stay of the liberty of a citizen.\nOzekhome argued that contrary to FG’s position, Kanu’s release from detention would guarantee peace in both the South East and the country\nHe said: “In fact, my lords, on the contrary, the release of Kanu will actually bring peace and tranquility to the South East in particular and the nation in general\n“This was demonstrated after the judgement of this court that ordered the release of the Respondent. Immediately the judgement was delivered, there was so much joy and happiness in the entire South East. There was so much jubilation and merriment.”\nHe argued that Dokubo’s case was different from that of Kanu.\nAccording him, while Dokubo applied to be granted bail, pending the determination of the charge against him, in Kanu’s case, the appellate court had already terminated his trial and ordered his release.\nRelying on the case of Olisa Metuh Vs FRN, Kanu’s lawyer argued that the law forbade the grant of stay of execution in a criminal case.\nHe told the court that the IPOB leader did not jump bail, stressing that he only escaped from the country to save his life, after soldiers illegally invaded his house in 2017, in an operation that led to the death of 28 persons.\nOzekhome argued that the federal government, being in contempt of the judgement of the appellate court, could not approach it to seek any favourable order.\n“They are already in contempt of order of this court. This application is therefore nothing but a slap on the face of this court,” he said.\nAfter the three-man panel of justices of the appellate court, led by Justice Haruna Tsanami, had listened to both sides, it reserved its ruling till a date to be communicated to the parties.\nMeanwhile, six Igbo traditional rulers yesterday stormed the court to demand the release of the detained IPOB leader.\nThe monarchs, who were all dressed in their regallia, said they were in court to show solidarity to their son, even as they stayed and observed the proceedings till the end.\nThe traditional rulers that were in court included HRM Eze Innocent Nwaigwe, Secretary Umuahia North Council of Traditional Rulers; HRM, Eze Nnamdi Ofoegbu, Chairman Ohuhu Council of Traditional Rulers; and HRM Eze Iheanyichukwu Ezigbo, Chairman Ibeku council. Others are HRM Eze Pastor Philip Ajomiwe, immediate past Chairman, Umuahia North Council; and HRM Eze Eddy Ibeabuchi, former Chairman Umuahia North Council and HRM Eze Ben Oriaku, Ikwuano LGA.\nIt will be recalled that the appellate court had in a judgement delivered on October 13, ordered Kanu’s release from detention, even as it terminated further proceedings on the case the federal government entered against him.\nThe court said it was satisfied that FG flagrantly violated all known laws when it forcibly rendered Kanu from Kenya to the country for continuation of his trial.\nIt held that such arbitrary use of power by the Nigerian government, divested the trial court of the jurisdiction to continue with Kanu’s trial.\nThough FG had since gone to the Supreme Court to challenge the judgement, it, however, in line with the rules, it approached the Court of Appeal to seek a stay of execution of the verdict.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"https://www.vanguardngr.com/2022/10/biafra-why-we-wont-release-kanu-fg-tells-appeal-court/","2":"1410","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999771118"},{"0":"Abuja – President Muhammadu Buhari will leave Abuja on Tuesday for New Delhi to participate in the 3rd Summit of the India-Africa Forum aimed at boosting socio-economic development in Africa and India.\nThis is contained in a statement issued in Abuja on Sunday by the Special Adviser on Media and Publicity to the president, Mr Femi Adesina.\nThe India-Africa Forum was established in 2008 as the official platform for the advancement of mutually-beneficial relations between India and African nations.\nAdesina stated that President Buhari, the Indian Prime Minister, Mr Narendra Modi and other participating Heads of State and Government would deliberate on issues of common concern to their countries such as climate change and international terrorism.\nHe noted that this year’s summit would enable the leaders to discuss additional measures aimed at boosting joint collaboration to accelerate the pace of socio-economic development in Africa and India.\nThe summit, which follows the 2nd Summit held in Addis Ababa in 2011, will enable the leaders to deliberate on further cooperation for the alleviation of poverty, and the eradication of hunger, disease and illiteracy.\nPresident Buhari would hold bilateral talks with Prime Minister Modi and other senior Indian government officials on Wednesday, ahead of the opening of the summit on Thursday.\nBuhari would also meet with Chief Executive Officers of Indian companies with existing or prospective interests in Nigeria before returning to Abuja on Oct. 30.\nThe President would be accompanied by the governors of Kano and Delta states, as well as the National Security Adviser, Retired Maj.-Gen.

Photo: Lamidi Bamidele.\nBy Akintola Omigbodun\nI have made a few journeys recently between Lagos and Osogbo, Osun State. The outward leg of the journey from Lagos has been on the Lagos to Ibadan expressway, the Ibadan to Ile-Ife expressway up to Gbongan, Osun State and then on the Gbongan to Osogbo road while the return leg of the journey has been in the reverse order.\nHowever, on one of the journeys, the outward leg was from Lagos to Ikorodu to Itoikin to Ijebu-Ode to Ijebu-Igbo.\nThe journey then continued on the road from Ijebu-Igbo to Orile-Owu, Osun State and this road passes through a rural area and a forest reserve with a bridge across the River Osun. The journey was next from Orile-Owu to Apomu where we joined the Ibadan to Ile-Ife expressway and then onwards to Ikire, Gbongan and finally the Gbongan to Osogbo road.\nThe alternative route was chosen such that one could avoid any possible traffic delays on the Lagos to Ibadan expressway. The journey on the alternative route took one hour more than the typical time spent on the primary route through the Lagos to Ibadan expressway. Once the reconstruction of the Lagos to Ibadan expressway commenced about two years ago, journey times between Lagos and Ibadan have been unpredictable and the typical time for completion of the journey between Lagos and Osogbo has been about five and a half hours. However, in recent times the contractor, Julius Berger Nigeria, for the Lagos to Sagamu portion of the Lagos to Ibadan expressway has stopped all work on the project.\nThe contractor, Reynolds Construction Company, on the Sagamu to Ibadan portion has been carrying out limited earthworks, concrete works for drainage and the crash barriers at the central road edge, placement of crushed stone base and finishing the asphalt pavement on certain stretches.\nThe contractors’ operations have not given any cause for delays and with the excellent road surface on the completed stretches, the journey time between Lagos and Osogbo has been about four hours.\nThe alternative route has an excellent road surface from Mile 12, Lagos to the roundabout at the centre of Ikorodu as reconstruction of this road was completed last year. However, there are several failed portions of the Ikorodu to Itoikin road and the Itoikin to Ijebu-Ode road thus making for longer journey times on these roads. The current Ogun State Government has constructed a bridge at Ijebu-Ode across the Sagamu to Benin expressway making for safe passage into and out of Ijebu-Ode on the Itoikin to Ijebu-Ode road. The Ogun State Government also has urban renewal projects at Ijebu-Ode and Ijebu-Igbo and has completed or has under construction fly-over bridges to ease traffic movement at some road intersections in both towns.\nI have brought these to our attention so that we accept that it is within our means to provide some fly-over bridges across the Lagos to Ibadan expressway especially at the Mowe/Redemption Camp stretch and closer to Lagos at the Ibafo/Arepo stretch. Funding for the completion of the reconstruction works on the Lagos to Ibadan expressway appears uncertain at the moment. We must find the funds for building these bridges now bearing in mind that there are consequential costs if we do not build them.\nThe Federal Ministry of Works should bring to President Buhari’s attention the need to conclude all funding arrangements for the reconstruction of the Lagos to Ibadan expressway. In particular, an early decision should be made on whether tolls would be charged for the use after reconstruction of the expressway and on the levels of tolls to be charged.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"http://www.vanguardngr.com/2015/08/recent-journeys-between-lagos-and-osogbo-osun-state/","2":"912","3":"Travel","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999732971"},{"0":"Shock in Ogun community as woman discharges maggots from private part\nResidents of Olakula area of Idiroko in Ipokia Local Government Area of Ogun State witnessed a jaw-dropping spectacle on _Wednesday as maggots dropped continuously from the private parts of a woman identified as Iya Toheeb.\nThe scene turned chaotic as residents trooped out to see the woman sat in a car with the assistance of family members and sympathisers.\nIt was thought that she might have been a victim of money-making ritual after her condition allegedly defied orthodox medication.\nOur correspondent learnt that the woman was also brought to one of the men she was associated with, a carpenter in the community.

Let the EFCC publish the Accounts’ Details without delay”.\nThe statement further adds, “Mr Imam talked about properties owned by Okorocha which the commission had marked. It is also important that Mr. Imam publish those properties because the properties marked had been acquired by Okorocha about twenty years ago. Since Mr. Imam has begun media trial, let the properties be also published for Nigerians to know the truth.\n“We have repeatedly told this story, that before the 2019 election, the PDP elements in Imo had written to the EFCC, alleging that Okorocha had planned to use all the state funds to finance the election of his choice candidates. The EFCC, leveraging on the petitions, seized all the accounts of the state including the ones meant for the payment of salaries, pensions, severance allowances and so on. We have made this particular claim severally and the EFCC or any other interested person or persons have never faulted our claim.\n“It has also been on the basis of these petitions written by the PDP government then led by Chief Emeka Ihedioha against Okorocha and the family, that the EFCC has been on the neck of Okorocha.\n“Even after that Government had petitioned the commission and the commission acting on the petitions, the government also instituted more than twelve commissions and panels to probe Okorocha and family, on the same issues or items the EFCC is investigating.\n“Some of the panels have submitted their reports to the current government in the state led by Governor Hope Uzodinma while others are still sitting and equally conducting media trials on Okorocha.\nRead Also: Imo to get N7.9b cash seized from Okorocha\n“Obviously, the EFCC has been misinformed.

The proposed budget for the overseas printing is put at over N6 billion.\nVanguard learnt that those opposed to the printing of the papers abroad have reportedly drawn the attention of INEC Chairman to the fact that it was against the interest of Nigeria for such action to be taken at the time when the Presidency had already made a case for the printing of the documents locally.\nThe antagonists of the proposal, Vanguard also gathered, had reportedly opted to report the action of the management to President Goodluck Jonathan, who only last week made a case for the printing of security documents with the Nigerian Security and Minting Printing Company, as a means of promoting national security and job creation.\nThe angry officials are said to have queried the rationale of taking such a huge and security-related job outside Nigeria when there were many local printing companies that could conveniently handle it. To prove their point that the papers could be printed locally, the officials cited the successful printing of the ballot papers used in the Anambra, Ekiti and Osun elections by local contractors.\nAccording to them, the papers that were printed within the country were foul-proof and passed all INEC’s security checks.\nWhile kicking against the foreign contract, the officials, who pleaded anonymity, called on the Federal Government to stop the commission from awarding the job to foreigners especially as the materials needed for the printing were also available in the country.\nThey also pointed to the fact that the 2011 election was postponed because of the non-delivery of the ballot papers sprinted abroad on time.\nBut a senior INEC official told Vanguard on Monday that the commission would remain focused in its honest and earnest desire to ensure the success of the 2015 election.\nDefending the decision of the management to print the papers abroad, the officials, who pleaded anonymity because he had not been authorized to speak on the matter, said that no company in Nigeria had the capacity to produce the quality and quantity of paper required and be able to deliver to the commission before December this year.\n“We are concerned about the capacity of printing press in Nigeria. The time available to us as a commission to conduct the election and the quality and quantity of materials to be delivered by the local contractors do matter to us,” the official said.\n“If you must know, for us to conduct the election in February 2015, it means that we must take delivery of the ballot papers in December this year to avoid a repeat of what happened in 2011 when we had to postpone an election because of the late arrival of ballot papers from South Africa,” the officer added.\nReminded that the President last week made a case for the printing of such vital documents with the NSMPC of Nigeria, the officer said, “Well, as we get along and the capacity of the company to handle such assignments grow, we will patronize it. For now, there is none in the country to do such complex job for INEC,” he said.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"http://www.vanguardngr.com/2014/09/2015-polls-trouble-brews-inec-n9bn-ballot-papers-contract/#sthash.MPWCDced.dpufi","2":"1072","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999847412"},{"0":"By YEMISI SULEIMAN\nBezhiwa Idakula, simply known as Bez, is an explosive soul singer with a truly unique voice and playful stage presence. In addition to an amazing performance at the 2012 ‘Super Sun Concert’ held at the Eko Hotel & Suites, Victoria Island, Lagos, the Soul and Rock star had an outstanding year in 2012, from being inducted into the MTV Iggy Hall of Fame and premiering ‘Stupid Song’ ft Praiz on BET International to being honoured at the ‘Top 40 Personalities Under 40’ by Applause Africa magazine, amongst others.\nHe begins year 2013 with his European and American tour and an upcoming album. As he prepares for the release of his second album, the Nasarawa State-born star says fans should expect a bit more of African sound in his music, shielding it with a bit of mainstream Rock while keeping the Soul genre very much present in the music.\nSitting casually in his studio, Bez talks to Allure about the beginning, his meteoric rise and fame, expectations for the second album and more.\nFirst of all, congratulations on the success of your ‘Super Sun Concert’.\nHow would you describe the experience?\nIt was very exciting to have my own mega-concert in Lagos. I’ve been doing a lot of mini-concerts around Lagos and Nigeria. It was amazing to have it. The turn up was great and we had great sound. The whole thing was just really amazing. It was the first and you know how it is with first (time out). So, it was really exciting.\nWhat were your early musical influences?\nMy dad used to play the guitar. He was a politician, late Honourable Amos Idakula. He taught me how to play the guitar when I was 9. I just kept practicing because I have this love for the instrument and I love music. I grew up in a very musical home. My sister sang; my dad used to sing and record stuff with my mum and my mum will back up for him.\nYes. Just for the fun of it. They will hit the record button, sit down and create their own tape. So, it was amazing to grow up in that kind of environment. It sort of just set the path for me automatically. I did some plays and musicals in primary school. When I got to secondary school, I joined the choir and I was there for like six years; the whole (time I spent in) my secondary school.\nWhen I got to the university, I joined the choir for one year and left because it wasn’t just for me.\nI think I had my own style of music by then and the choir was more like playing worship and praise songs. I started to create my own style of music and started to practice a lot more by myself. Eventually, when I left the university in 2007, I started playing somewhere named Taruwa. That was where my sister started. Taruwa is mainly for spoken word poetry, music. It’s somewhere in Ikoyi, Lagos. It was a platform for people to express themselves. I played there every two weeks for years.\nIn 2009, I was picked for Hennessey Artistry, through Cobhams Asuqwo. That was where it started really growing. So, I released some songs in 2009 and in 2011, I released an album.\nAt what point did you decide to do music full time?\nIt was when I was in my 2nd or 3rd year in the university. One of my friends, Dr Frabs, had left school and was working with KUSH. They had a gig in some church and called me to put a young band together. So, he called me and a couple of my friends in school; that we should put a band together and play for them.\nIt was great to have that kind of experience with KUSH because I was a huge fan. So, we played for them and Emem asked me if I was really thinking of going into music? I said I wasn’t really sure and she said: “Well, I think you are in music already because I can just tell you are in it already”.\nI think that stirred me and I started reading a lot about purpose. I started reading a lot about why I’m here on earth; what I’m going to do career-wise. I figured that I was created to create music and then to add value to people, using music as my tool. So, it came together for me recently. But before then, I just did music for fun. I never knew I was going to flow into it professionally.\nThe ‘Stupid Song’, whose idea was it? How did you get it together with Praiz?\nWe were in the studio and needed to create a song that was going to resonate with people. Now, it came by mistake, totally by mistake. Somebody stepped into the studio and said he wanted to do a stupid song because Nigerians really like stupid songs (laughs). Cobhams was like: “Ha, which kind of stupid do you want to do now?”\nThen, he started thinking in a more creative way and the guy said: “No, I don’t want all those ‘oyinbo’ kind of songs. I want a proper stupid song”. At that moment, the idea came to Cobhams to create a song that was a mixture of different songs that we sang back in the day. So, we got into the studio and he created music almost immediately. Then, I started giving him the different songs that we sang and so we added some things and removed some. It was amazing.\nOne of our friends, Omolara, came and heard it and was like “Wow. I think you should bring in somebody who has the same voice texture with you in this song; just do collaboration and create something really nice.” So, we got in Praiz the next day. He was supposed to be travelling but he came really early, did his part of the song and we had it done in two days.\nSo, did you think it was going to be this big? Did you think it was going to be well received?\nI knew it was going to be well received because of the way the Nigerian market is and how the Nigerian market relates to certain things in music. But I did not actually know it will be loved this much. I didn’t know it was going to blow like it did but I knew it was going to be well received.\nYour induction into the MTV Iggy Hall of fame, how does that make you feel?\nMTV Iggy is all about discovering talents around the world; talents that are not mainstream at the moment. They go round the world like Asia, Africa, discovering talents. When they do that, they induct them into the hall of fame; all that is saying is watch out for these people next year and these people are really going to be huge. So, it was amazing for MTV Iggy to discover me in whatever way they did and to induct me into their hall of fame.\nI think it was just more of a confirmation that we are doing the right thing and we are in the right path, so we’ll just keep going and keep moving. The way MTV Iggy will discover you, that is the way a lot of us people around the world will discover you as well. So, with time, you will be really huge. I think it was really important for me.\nDo you write your songs?\nYeah. I write most of my music. For my Super Sun Album, I had one song that wasn’t written by me and then two or three other songs that I co-wrote with some of my friends. But I do write most of my songs. For my new album, I have been doing a lot of writing with a great artiste called Simi. It will be more like 50-50 writing for my new album. I really believe in two heads being better than one. When you have a partner in writing, you can come up with really great ideas.\nTell us about growing up. What was it like for you?\nI grew up in Jos. Jos is now really different from the way it was back then. It was really nice growing up in Jos. It has very cool weather and during Harmattan, it could get really cold so, sometimes, you find us sitting outside, burning wood to keep warm. Not that you can’t be warm inside, but it was fun; just like burn fire night. It was like an oyinbo town. It was really great growing up in Jos. We used to have family gathering burn fire night. We go to my sister’s school and perform as a family. I would play the guitar and the rest of my family would sing. These days, if you are not so well to do, you don’t have a house with a large compound. Even if you are well to do, you probably live in a flat in Lagos.\nThen, in the north, you have a large compound; you have space to play and ride your bicycle in the house; you have trees to climb. It was just fun growing up as a kid in Jos. Musically, a lot of people would play music for the fun of it. You hear of a new guy in town, you go check out the guy; go back home and practice to sing like him. Sometimes, you go to a garden and some musicians are playing, and you hang out with them. With time, you find out that you are building your social circle around musicians and you are just honing your skills continuously. Eventually, you discover that you have honed perfectly and can go commercial. I think, that is one of the most important things about artistes that come from Jos.\nYou are from Nasarawa State. What fond memories do you have of it?\nA lot of people do not know much about Nasarawa State. When I go around the world and people ask me where I’m from, I tell them I’m a Nigerian from Nasarawa State. First of all, Nasarawa State is the next-big-thing when it comes to resources. It’s the next big thing after oil and the more people start focusing on solid minerals, we can have alternative means of income for the country. There are loads of things I want to do with the youth in Nasarawa State; adding more value to their lives by creating more opportunities for the youth in school and more.\nIf you have a word for the governor, what would that be?\nThe governor has been doing a lot and it’s great to see somebody coming in, seeing the way things are and trying to create something amazing from it. We have a university in Nasarawa State which is really great. I think there are more things to be done and people like us, sons of the soil, can join hands with the government to create something really amazing for the state.\nLet’s talk about your Europe/America tour. What is it all about?\nMost of the time, musicians just want to play around the world. It’s great to be able to be invited for a couple of gigs. We were invited to play at the Colombia University, New York for their African Economic Forum. There is a place called the Rock Wood Music Hall. That’s a great venue in New York that has booking agents coming through with a lot of booking; we will be playing there as well.\nThat usually turns out into more gigs. There was a time we played in South Africa. We went there for one gig and when we got in on Sunday and played that Sunday. By the time we finished, we were booked for like three or four more gigs during the week. So, it is a process; you go, you do two or three and find doors open for you to do more and you keep going.\nI will also be recording my new album in New York, shooting a video and then recording with an artiste, Ambassador, who is a rapper from Ghana but lives in Brooklyn. So, there is a lot to do.\nWhat should your fans expect from your new album?\nMy new album is taking a bit of departure from the sound that they know Bez for. First of all, I have evolved into another level, so it’s not a complete departure. It’s just a small evolution. I think I’ve found a stronger voice, so that will be very prominent in my music. I’m putting a more African sound in my music as well, shielding it with a bit of mainstream and Rock while keeping the Soul genre very much present in the music. So, it will be much more exciting. The album and the new music will be very exciting for my fans.\nMusically, is there any musician you look up to? Who do you admire? Who would you have actually learnt from?\nThere are a lot of musicians that are my colleagues in the industry that I admire. For example, Tu Face, who is first of all, a really humble person; but this is somebody who knew exactly what he wanted to do from the word go and he pursued it. I’m sure he had loads and loads of setbacks but he just kept on. It’s amazing to see his growth over the years and he is growing stronger and stronger.\nThose are the kind of people I admire; that you can look up to them and say: ‘This person was able to do it and he wasn’t able to do it in just a year or two’. You could see that there is a period of paying dues; there was a period of growth and there was this period when he became a mega super star. So, those are the kind of people I look up to.\nYou always wear a fedora. Is that your style signature?\nApart from the fact that I think sometimes it makes me look cooler (laughs). First of all, I wear prescription lenses (medicated lenses) so, I thought if I am going to wear glasses, why not make it look really nice. I thought to use fashionable frames and then the Fedora; I used to wear face caps before. I had different types of caps but at a point, I just settled with the Fedora.\nIt works for me and it gives me that extra look. My style could be very laid back; sometimes, jeans with t-shirts, beads, hats with glasses. I just jazz it up to make it look interesting. To me, it’s just how I feel like expressing myself. I am not so fussy about wearing too many things.\nDo you have a designer that makes clothes for the red carpet for you?\nIn Lagos, I am very good friends with MAI so, he does a lot of stuff for me. Orange Culture does for me as well. I have a lot of people that I have worked with randomly but these are the more consistent ones I use.\nYou were one of those honoured at the ‘40 Personalities Under 40’. What was it all about?\nBy Applause Africa magazine; they had an edition on the ‘Top 40 Personalities Under 40’ making a mark in the society and I was on the cover for that edition. Once again, to be recognized in an industry as one of the leaders is amazing. That way, you know you are doing the right thing and people are noticing. They flew us over to New York for the launch and I performed as well at the show.\nApart from music, what else do you do?\nMusic is (not) the only thing I do. I do advocacy as well for Friends Africa. I am working with them; teaching people how to protect themselves against malaria, tuberculoses and AIDS. I am also working as a board member of Ovie Brume Foundation. Again, I have great passion for education because, when I was in secondary school, I lost my dad and somebody paid my fees throughout secondary school and also part of university (a lot of people assisted). So, I thought to myself, where would I be now if people didn’t give me that opportunity to finish my education. So, I always think of working with people to give back to society and help when it comes to education. That is what I do with education.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"https://www.vanguardngr.com/2017/09/attack-not-igbo-sultan-northern-youths/amp/stupid","2":"3471","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999771118"},{"0":"By Levinus Nwabughiogu-Abuja\nDespite the indefinite postponement of the inauguration of the campaign council by the APC Presidential Campaign Council (PCC) on Wednesday, the Leader of the House of Representatives, Hon.

And I would have done this if I had stayed.”\nHe dismissed the opposition against the policy as “absolutely unnecessary” because “The CBN has staff manning its branches and cash offices across the Federation.”\nSanusi added: “Moving staff to the Lagos office to streamline operations and make them more effective and reduce cost is a normal prerogative of management.\n“The problem we have now is that many employees are children of politically exposed persons and their Abuja life and businesses are more important than the CBN work.\n“The CBN is just an address for them and if they have to choose between their spoilt Abuja life and the job, they would gladly leave the CBN.\n“All the more reason for the Governor to put his foot down and get rid of those elements they are dangerous for the bank’s future\n“The question of locating functions is a STRATEGIC and not tactical one. A proper analysis should be done to identify which roles are best suited to Lagos and which to Abuja. Once the logic is clear the people then follow. Non communication of strategic intent opens the door to mischievous misrepresentation and arbitrariness.\n“I don’t like the idea of arguing that the office structure can not handle the staff numbers. I am sure Julius Berger would refute that if they wanted to engage.”\nOn how the relocation of staff should be done, he suggested: “Individual situations should be considered. As much as possible we should be empathetic. For example young mothers with kids in school who do not need to move can be prioritised to stay in Abuja or those with medical conditions etc.”\nHe advised the CBN not to bend to political pressure, saying it must push through decisions hoe matter tough.\nAccording to him: “My advice to the Governor is to go ahead with his policy. Once the CBN starts bending to political pressure on one thing it will continue doing so.\n“Northern politicians will shout that this is moving from Abuja to Lagos. Abuja is a federal capital not a northern issue. So long as this is a principled decision the noise should be ignored.\n“When i was about to license Jaiz bank there was a lot of religious noise from CAN etc. Even enlightened people like Okey Emelamah were going to sue me to court on religious grounds. I ignored it and licenced the bank. Nothing happened.\n“A christian Governor after me licenced at least two more non- interest banks. No one is even noticing again.\n“Ethnic and religious bigots will always shout. The CBN should rise above it and just do what needs to be done.

One of the resolutions thereof was the condemnation of Indigenous Oil and Gas Companies and Marginal Field Operators, concerning their anti labour posture and practices including the termination of the employment of any workers who has indicated willingness to belong to the union.\n“Those who are threatened and compelled to disown the union are then treated as slave workers within their own country. The case of Neconde Energy Ltd (of Nestoil Group of companies) is particularly worrisome as the issue of dignity in labour and infringement on workers’ rights to freedom of Association is foreign to them leading to mass sack of workers that joined the Union and dehumanization of same in total disregard to rule of engagement and the laws of the land.\n“The actions of companies such as Neconde in mass sack of Nigerian workers contribute in no small measure to the unending militancy in the Niger Delta.\n“This company has not only conducted itself as being above the provisions of extant laws and regulations guiding the operations of oil and gas companies in Nigeria, but has also severally boasted that no government agency can call it to order.\n“It was therefore no surprise that Neconde has defied multiple interventions from the Federal Ministry of Labour and Employment, the Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) and the top Management of Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) and Nigeria Petroleum Development Company (NPDC) for the company to toe the path of law and order and comply with Nigerian labour laws.\n“The company is apparently bolstered by the fact that it has continued, without any sanctions from government regulatory authorities, to flagrantly breach the provisions of the Personal Income Tax Amendment Act (PITA) and Pension Reform Act (PRA) by not remitting deducted income taxes and pension contributions to the Lagos and Delta states’ boards of internal revenue and authorized Pension Fund Administrators (PFAs) respectively.\n“The owners and management of Neconde have therefore made themselves to believe that they are above the laws and government of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\n“Having explored all options without getting the necessary understanding, and an apparent failure of relevant authorities of Government to call to order these recalcitrant organizations especially Neconde, PENGASSAN gives the Federal Government and its relevant Agencies seven (7) days’ notice to embark on a nationwide strike effective December 18, 2017 if government fails to direct the Management of Neconde and other companies to recall our sacked members as the only option to address this injustice and lawlessness.\n“PENGASSAN appeals to all Nigerians to show understanding and to use this window to stockpile adequate quantity of premium motor spirit (PMS) and other petroleum products that will last them during the upcoming festive period as this strike will be indefinite.”","1":"http://thenationonlineng.net/pengassan-threatens-embark-nationwide-strike/","2":"955","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999904633"},{"0":"By Femi Aribisala\nBetween 1983 and 1985, Peter Onu of Nigeria was Acting Secretary-General of the OAU. At the 1985 Summit in Addis Ababa, statesmen like Julius Nyerere, President of Tanzania, lobbied for his election as substantive Secretary-General. However, there was a major stumbling block to Peter Onu’s candidature: his Head of State, Muhammadu Buhari, was campaigning against him.\nBuhari claimed: “This generation of Nigerians and indeed future generations have no other country than Nigeria.” But when the crunch came, his allegiance to Nigeria disappeared. In the election of the OAU Secretary-General in 1985, Buhari voted against Nigeria and for Niger instead. He secured the election of Ide Oumarou, a Fulani man from Niger; as opposed to an Igbo man from Nigeria. By so doing, Buhari became the first and only Head of State in the history of modern international relations to vote against his country in favour of his tribe.\nYears later, General Buhari marched all the way from Daura to Ibadan to demand of Oyo State Governor, Lam Adeshina: “Why are your people killing my people?” Again, he was not referring to Nigerians as his people. Instead, he was an advocate for the rights of murderous Fulani herdsmen who killed Yoruba farmers that objected to their cattle grazing on their land and damaging their crops. This same Buhari who voted against Nigeria in 1985, and said in 2003: “Muslims should only vote those who will promote Islam,” is now shopping for votes nationwide. He should be rejected outright.\nIgnorance running riot\nIf APC had wanted to be taken seriously, it would have come up with a better presidential material than Buhari. There is something anomalous about a party whose mantra is change, recycling a 73 year old man as its candidate for the president of modern Nigeria. Buhari has little or no understanding of public policy. That is why APC will always come up with some excuse or the other not to have him participate in a debate with Jonathan. Buhari fought corruption by imposing ridiculous 300-year sentences on offenders. He fought exam malpractices by imposing 24-year prison sentences on school children.\nHe dealt with indiscipline by flogging people to queue at bus-stops. He dealt with food shortages by sending soldiers to break into private warehouses and shops. He fought trade imbalances by taking Nigeria back to the stone age of trade by barter (counter-trade). He sought to extradite a Nigerian from Britain by drugging and crating him.\nThere is so much about Buhari ending the Boko Haram insurgency as he did the Maitatsine insurgency in the 1980s. But the General needs to be advised that Boko Haram is not Maitatsine. Maitatsine was in two towns: Boko Haram is in three states with spillover effects into others. Maitatsine fought with bows and arrows: Boko Haram fights with sophisticated weapons. Maitatsine was a local insurgency, Boko Haram is an international phenomenon.\nAnti-corruption hypocrisy: Buhari does not know what corruption means and how to fight it. He became Nigeria’s Head of State through the corruption of a coup d’état and he then tried to fight corruption with corruption. Imposing retroactive decrees and killing Nigerians under them is corruption. Putting an Igbo vice-president in Kirikiri, while placing the Fulani president under palatial house arrest, is corruption.\nDetaining people like Michael Ajasin in jail, even after they were discharged and acquitted by kangaroo courts, is corruption. Jailing journalists for telling the truth is corruption. Putting pressure on a judge in order to jail Fela Anikulapo-Kuti is corruption. Shepherding 53 suitcases of contraband unchecked through Customs during a currency change exercise is corruption. Swearing an affidavit that your school-leaving certificate is with the military when it is not, is corruption.\nTransforming Nigeria: Buhari’s shameful past is dwarfed by the achievements of Goodluck Jonathan. Under Jonathan, Nigeria has emerged as by far the largest economy in Africa with a GDP of $503 billion; nearly double the previous estimates. South Africa now comes a distant second with $350 billion. With the unbundling of PHCN after 52 years of gridlock, and with now the realizable target of 20,000 megawatts of electricity by 2020, Nigeria’s GDP will soon double that of South Africa.\nCNN Money projects that the fastest growing economy in the world in 2015 will be China (7.3% growth rate); followed by Qatar (7.1%); and then followed by Nigeria (7%). This belies all the misinformation about the Nigerian economy dished out by the APC and attests to the astute management of the economy by the Jonathan administration. The seemingly ambitious Vision 20 2020, proclaimed under the Abacha regime to make Nigeria one of the 20 largest economies in the world by 2020 is now well in sight. Today, Nigeria is already the 23rd largest economy in the world. Kudos to Jonathan, we have overtaken such European countries as Austria and Belgium.\nIn 2010, when Jonathan became acting president, life expectancy in Nigeria was 47 years. Today, it is 54 years; an improvement of seven years. Adroit application of SURE-P funds has reduced the maternal mortality ratio in Nigeria by 26%. Under Jonathan, Nigeria has become Guinea Worm-free; a disease previously affecting 800,000 Nigerians yearly. In the last six months, there has been no new case of polio in Nigeria. If this goes on for another two and a half years, Nigeria will be declared polio-free.\nBill Gates, the richest man in the world, hailed Nigeria’s fight against polio as one of the great world achievements of 2014. He said: “The infrastructure Nigeria has built to fight polio actually made it easier for them to swiftly contain Ebola. The fact that Nigeria is now Ebola-free is a great example of how doing the work to fight things like fighting polio also leaves countries better prepared to deal with outbreaks of other diseases.”\nInvestors’ haven: In the last three years, the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) has ranked Nigeria as the number one country for foreign investments in Africa. We also receive more home-remittances than any other African country; a vote of confidence in our economy by Nigerians living abroad. They remitted $23 billion in 2013, a figure far more than the $18 billion received by Egypt; the country with the second highest home remittance in Africa. It is a testament to Goodluck Jonathan’s adroit management of the Nigerian economy that the richest African is now a Nigerian.\nIn 2010, when Jonathan came to power, Aliko Dangote was the 463rd richest man in the world, with a total fortune of $2.1 billion. Today, he is the 23rd richest man in the world, with a total fortune of $25 billion. Dangote’s billions are “made in Nigeria.” Indeed, under Jonathan, Nigeria now has the fourth highest rate of returns on investments in the world, according to UNCTAD.\nCrisis of unemployment\nThe big challenge has to do with jobs. Every year, another 1.8 million people are offloaded into the job market. However, while the APC says Buhari will create 720,000 jobs a year if elected, Jonathan created 1.6 million jobs in 2013. He has established such innovative programmes as Nagropreneurs and YOUWIN that support young farmers and entrepreneurs with grants, training and mentorship. He has also instituted internship schemes to enhance the capacity of university graduates to secure gainful employment.\nThe unemployment problem is compounded by the more than doubling of the education budget under Jonathan. Every Nigerian child now has the opportunity to go to school. Indeed, there has been a 10 million increase in school enrolment in Nigeria under this government. There has also been a 75% increase in O’ Level credit pass in Maths and English. Jonathan established 125 Almajiri schools in 13 northern states. He also established 14 new federal universities. There is now a federal university in every state. Indeed, the kidnapping of the Chibok schoolgirls derives from the disenchantment of the Boko Haram that many Northern girls are now going to school.\nDealing with corruption: According to Transparency International, Nigeria has not become more corrupt under Goodluck Jonathan. Out of 178 countries ranked in 2010, Nigeria was the 134th most corrupt country. In 2014, Nigeria was ranked 136th. Unlike Buhari, Jonathan understands that corruption has to be attacked institutionally, from the roots. Therefore, he proposed the abrogation of the petroleum subsidy; one of the biggest avenues for corruption in government. However, Nigerians refused. Jonathan has sanitized the corruption in fertilizer distribution. The Minister of Agriculture, Akinwumi Adesina, lamented that between 1980 and 2010, Nigeria lost 776 billion naira to corrupt fertilizer racketeering.\nThat effectively came to an end under Jonathan. Through the innovative e-wallet system, farmers are given cell-phones through which they now have direct and easy access to government-provided fertilizer, chemicals and seedlings. Jonathan has also sanitised the banking system by removing dinosaur managing directors, recovering indigent loans and using AMCON to mop up bad loans. By instituting e-payment systems, he sanitized the civil service by removing 50,000 ghost-workers in one fell swoop. He has equally got rid of ghost voters from the electoral register; over 1 million ghost voters were removed from the Zamfara INEC register alone. Under Jonathan, we have had free and fair elections one after the other; in Edo, Anambra, Ondo, Ekiti and Osun.\nAgriculture has been transformed under this administration. Thanks to Jonathan, agriculture now accounts for 22% of Nigeria’s GDP, more than oil and gas which only account for 15.9%. Under Jonathan, Nigeria has recorded a more than 50% reduction in food imports. Prior to his presidency, we had a food import bill of 1.4 trillion naira. But now, it is less than N700 billion. With the innovation of dry season rice-farming, Nigeria has reached 60% self-sufficiency in rice production. According to the Food and Agricultural Organisation of the United Nations (FAO), Nigeria is now the largest producer of cassava in the world. The Jonathan government built six strategically-located perishable cargo airports in Ilorin, Jalingo, Jos, Lagos, Makurdi andYola; in close proximity to Nigeria’s food baskets.\nIt is remarkable that Northern farmers were able to donate five million tubers of yam in order to raise 5 billion naira for Buhari’s presidential election campaign. If Jonathan’s transformation agenda in agriculture was not working as planned, they would not have been able to do this.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"http://www.vanguardngr.com/2015/02/jonathan-superior-presidential-material-buhari/#sthash.8tVjoR1z.dpufAnother","2":"2342","3":"Politics","4":"2","5":"en","6":"0.9999694824"},{"0":"Says Sen Grassley’s claim of Magu’s detention of Buhari’s critics unfounded and baseless\nThe attempt by a United States lawmaker to block the return of $320 million Abacha loot to Nigeria has been resisted by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC).\nThe commission said on Friday in a statement that the allegation by the Chairman of the U.S Senate Committee on Finance, Charles Grassley that the money should not be released to Nigeria because EFCC was detaining critics of President Muhamadu Buhari, was a lie from the pit of hell.\nThe statement, which was signed by the acting Head of Media and Publicity of the EFCC, Mr Tony Orilade, said that the commission only arrests and charges to court Nigerians who have stolen public funds and does not have any critic of Buhari in its custody.\nThe Commission said that among those currently in prison were key political allies of President Buhari and those from the opposition who were properly convicted for corruption by courts of competent jurisdiction, and not on partly affiliation.\nThe 86-year-old US Republican Senator had in a letter dated April 1, 2020, and addressed to the Chief Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section of the U.S Department of Justice, Deborah Connor, maliciously accused Magu of “detaining individuals who have spoken against the Buhari government.”\nALSO READ: COVID-19: U.S. lifts 997 Americans back home\nBut EFCC regretted the action of the lawmaker, which it said was borne out of ignorance on the part of the Senator and the actions of some desperate Nigerians to frustrate the Nigerian government from recovering the huge amount which was traced to the late former head of state.\nThe commission said that Magu could not have been faulted by the lawmaker if he had got his facts right because only recently the Federal Bureau of Investigation, FBI, singled out the EFCC boss and honoured him for boldly tackling corruption in Nigeria.\nThe statement said it was in recognition of Magu’s transparent work at the EFCC that the FBI recently gave an Award of Excellence to Mr Magu for his unique role in a joint field operation codenamed with the American agency entitled, “Operation Rewired”, which led to the arrest and prosecution of hundreds of wire fraud suspects in Nigeria and abroad.\n“It is worrisome that a high-ranking US lawmaker of the status of Grassley could not get his facts rightly nor establish a credible premise of attacking an FBI- celebrated Magu. Would the FBI have come out to acknowledge the effectiveness and credibility of the EFCC under Magu’s watch, if such allegation of oppressing opposition to President Buhari’s government had any merit?\n“Besides, only recently, former Attorney-General of the Federation (AGF) and Minister of Justice, Mr Mohammed Adoke (SAN), and an opposition PDP politician, poured encomiums on Magu on the visible achievements of the EFCC under his watch. According to Adoke, “President Muhammadu Buhari is highly celebrated for fighting corruption and the poster boy of this celebrated achievement is clearly Magu.\n“It would interest Sen Grassley to know that three former governors who are ranking members of the ruling All Progressive Congress, APC, which is President Buhari’s party, are currently serving jail terms for corruption. Is the EFCC also persecuting members of the President’s party?\n“Grassley evidently lacks any sound basis for linking the EFCC and Magu with any oppressive or separatist agenda against government opposition.\n“Records of convictions of the Commission are in the public domain as well as cases before the courts, which can be subjected to unbiased analysis and scrutiny.\n“We wish to reiterate that the EFCC under Magu is too focused on the anti-graft agenda of the government to be distracted by such empty claims of the lawmaker. Grassley and his sponsors are clearly on quicksand on this issue,” the commission said.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"https://www.vanguardngr.com/2020/04/efcc-blasts-us-senator-over-attempt-to-block-320m-abacha-loot/","2":"864","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999694824"},{"0":"THE 2015 race for Anambra central Senatorial seat is getting keener. A horde of aspirants are now on the prowl angling to snatch the seat from the incumbent Senator Chris Ngige of the All Progressives Congress (APC).\nBy Clifford Ndujihe\nAMong the leading contenders are: Senator Ngige; National Chairman of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), Chief Victor Umeh; a member of the House of Representatives, Hon. Uche Ekwunife; Leader of Nzuko Imeobi Idemili North and South, Dr. Obiora Okonkwo; former Secretary to the Anambra State Government, SSG (1999-2003), Prince Victor Ossy Ezenwa; Dr. Kodilichukwu Okelekwe; Mrs. Christy Okoye, Senator Annie Okonkwo and Mr. Sylvester Okonkwo.\nSenator Ngige, who is going for a second term in the Senate made his mark as governor of Anambra State for three years before he was thrown out of office by the law courts for election rigging. He is considered popular in Anambra central, which benefited immensely from his botched administration in terms of projects.\nHaving lost the last governorship election, the APC legislator, who has not indicated whether or not he is re-contesting, has however, said that most of those angling to stop him are political lightweights.\nSir Umeh, whose reign as APGA national chairman saw the party winning electoral laurels such as two governorship seats, senatorial, House of Representatives and state assembly slots, while declaring his intention to run for the seat, said the state of affairs in the country now requires the Igbo, Anambra and Anambra Central to put their First Eleven forward. According to him, his experience as APGA leader and a delegate to the just concluded National Conference shows that much work is yet to be done and he is the most qualified person to execute the onerous duty for Ndigbo, South-East, Anambra and Anambra central. He is running on the banner of APGA.\nHon. Ekwunife is one of the two women in the race so far. The ranking Rep is aspiring on the banner of the PDP the platform that gave her, her first mandate in the House. She left the PDP for the Progressives Peoples’ Alliance (PPA), contested the governorship and lost. She defected to APGA and retained her Reps’ seat. Now, she is back to the PDP from APGA. She believes that her popularity in Anambra central and PDP’s political muscle will see her through.\nDr. Okonkwo is the leader of Nzuko Imeobi Idemili North and South, the apex socio cultural and political organization of Idemili in Anambra Central Senatorial District, Political and Economic Adviser to the Archbishop of Onitsha & Metropolitan of Onitsha Ecclesiastical Province; President and Founder, Nigeria – Belgium Business Forum (NBBF) Coordinator of the Anambra State Good Governance Forum (ASGGOF).\nWhile declaring his intention to run on the plank of the PDP, he said: “We want to restore pride in the people, rebuild their confidence and make them believe again that power resides in them and in representing the people in the Senate, it will be with the awareness that power is in the hands of the people in which we shall demonstrate the will to deliver on the community charter of the senatorial zone, propagate quality representation anchored on accessibility, consultation, responsiveness and accountability to my constituents.”\nDr. Okelekwe, who boosts of knowledge of multimillion-dollar budgets and keen business experience from running his own flourishing business as C.E.O, wants to banish poverty from the zone through education.\nThe former governorship aspirant, who is aspiring on the platform of the PDP said: “I don’t believe that any individual should be denied the right to education on account of poverty. That is what drives me. That’s why I am contesting. I am not contesting for a Senate seat to indulge in primitive accumulation of wealth. Life is not about self. Life is about touching others. It is about living for others. That is why I am aspiring to go to the Senate.”\nHe said he wants to “get the people involved in the process of lawmaking. If I get elected as a senator, I will institute what I call monthly town hall meetings, which will rotate from one local government to the other. “In Anambra central, there are seven local government areas. We will use this mechanism to sound out the people, get their opinion and take into account their input in either proposing a new law or proposing an amendment to existing ones or moving a motion to draw the attention of government to certain areas.”\nEzenwa, who was SSG under former Governor Chinwoke Mbadinuju and former chairman of Njikoka local council said he is disturbed by the high rate of unemployment in the zone.\nMaking his intentions known during a consultations meeting with his constituents and journalists at his Abagana country home, Ezenwa, said he was aware of other heavyweights in the race but that the odds were in his favour.\nGale of endorsements\nAhead of the polls, the polity is awash with a gale of endorsements for the aspirants. Umeh got the endorsement of Anambra Central Women Forum (ACWF), which described him as a man of action, principle and integrity, tested and trusted to effectively represent Anambra Central Senatorial Zone in the Senate. ACWF President, Mrs. Adanma Chukwuma, said the group is backing Umeh because “we cannot sacrifice effective representation at the altar of partisan politics.”\nIn like manner, Idemili Action Movement, IAM and a socio-cultural association, Nzuko Imeobi, have thrown their weights behind Dr Obiora Okonkwo and urged voters and stakeholders in the Anambra Central senatorial zone not to repeat the mistakes of the past in electing their representatives in 2015.\nMaking the calls at different for a recently, IAM Chairman, Dr. Uche Ezeliora and Nzuko Imeobi President, Chief Edwin Ekwuno said: “We don’t support parties, we support candidates and it is in this regard that we are supporting the various calls for change and adopting Dr. Obiora Okonkwo of the PDP as our choice for the senatorial seat in the Central. His track record is people oriented and he has shown a sense of service to the people, which we believe will lift the state of development in the zone if he gets to the Senate.”\nAlso, writing about the aspirants, Professor Ben Nna Okoye said given the protracted problems facing Anambra Central, the zone needs a disciplined, focused, pragmatic, logical, creative, organized, problem-solver as its senator. According to him Dr. Okelekwe fits this description because he is a skilled and competent leader who is widely admired for his civility, diligence and political acuity.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"http://www.vanguardngr.com/2014/09/2015-knife-edge-battle-anambra-central/#sthash.WlepCUVY.dpuf","2":"1544","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999256134"},{"0":"Women from the Ipo community have blocked the entrance to the Port Harcourt airport.\nAs early as 7:30 am on Tuesday morning, the women from Ipo which is one of the host communities of the airport, blocked the gate at the airport roundabout, waving placards, singing, wailing, and even cooking at the gate.\nSome of the inscriptions on their banner include ‘We Demand Our Citizens Rights’, ‘Ipo Women Peaceful Protest’, among others.\nChannels Television gathered that the aggrieved women were trying to get government’s attention to their lack of electricity, good roads, and poor schools despite their community playing host to the airport.\nAs of the time of filing this report, their actions had caused a buildup of traffic as passengers could not access the airport.\nThis is the second time this year that the women are protesting.\nIt would be recalled that they protested on the 27th of March this year, but were pacified by the former Chairman of the Rivers Traditional Rulers Council, Sergeant Awuse.\nThe development comes as the Rivers State Police Command, on Monday, warned against planned protests by the Nigeria Union of Local Government Employees, (NULGE).\nIn a statement released on Sunday night, police spokesperson, Grace Iringe-Koko, said the police are aware of the protest.\n“The Rivers State Police Command has become aware of the planned protest by the Nigeria Union of Local Government Employees (NULGE), scheduled for June 24, 2024.

It is evident that the article reeks of hate and seems aimed at either getting President Buhari to regard Saraki his enemy, or fortifying whatever grievances might exist, if that is the case.\nThat is sad, because in no way does that motive contribute to nation-building, and in no way does it help Buhari whom history will ultimately hold responsible for what becomes of Nigeria from May 29, 2015. It is true we are in a democracy and people should have freedom of communication, but I believe we should exercise some self-control in the enjoyment of the freedom. I do not know the author in person or even by reputation, but I bet he seems to have some personal ‘agro’ against Saraki.\nI met Saraki sometime in 2011 after he became Chairman of the Senate Committee on the Environment. I as well as others in the civil society engaged with environmental issues in Nigeria were pleasantly surprised to be invited by that Committee for interaction.\nSaraki sat through the meetings with a note book in which he took copious notes as people made contributions. He also enriched the conversations by asking poignant questions. He was very civilized and we had the impression that he is educated in the real sense.\nIt was this very positive impression that Saraki made upon my colleagues and I that encouraged my organization and others to take a closer look at the state he had just left as governor. About that time, some international organizations asked us to advise on states towards which they could direct their interest in development activities. From our analysis, Kwara was highly recommended. The points that counted for Kwara included accessibility by air from Lagos/Ibadan and Abuja, having minimal security challenges, and a very positive civil service and receptive government.\nI am not sure how much of these were put in place by the governments before Saraki became governor of Kwara State. We subsequently took specific projects into rural communities in the state. Before doing that we approached his office in the Senate, and were introduced to an officer who took responsibility to lead us into Kwara. The government of that state received us in a very professional manner. Kwara was one of six states in which we unveiled the National Adaptation Strategy on Climate Change. During this period, Saraki’s name resonated so much in urban as well as rural areas of the state.\nWith respect to the article I read which I consider unfair, there are some specific observations to make and I itemize few out of the lot of them as they appear in that article.\n- The first is the title of the article: “Bukola Saraki in Maiduguri: Tentative first steps for 2019 Presidency”. My reaction would be that if truly Saraki’s Maiduguri trip is part of his seed planting towards the 2019 presidency of Nigeria, then it is commendable. Nigeria can ill-afford a reluctant President in 2019, or whatever other year for that matter. We’d rather an aspirant that has his sleeves rolled up and is tirelessly working towards actualizing his dream than one that suddenly wakes up one morning in 2019 to tell us that he is running for presidency in response to pressures from his people. Better to have presidential aspirants with hunger in their bellies and fire in their eyes which are fixed on a faraway goal than have 2019 overnight microwave presidential aspirants that treat the race to our much-cherished Aso Rock Presidential Villa like an after-thought.\n- The author had complained about the fact that “…most newspapers carried a syndicated picture of the ‘august visitor’ waving to the IDPs.” To that I ask, is that strange? Isn’t that what you see in governments including more mature democracies? What is wrong with this, one dares ask?\n- The author further inveighed that Saraki’s ultimate goal “remains presidency and he can’t even wait for 2019 before beginning to show his hands”. To this I say only a fool interested in 2019 presidency will wait till 2019 to start showing his hands. Is the office of the President of Nigeria not serious enough to warrant long-term thought and work? President Buhari provides a good and recent example of a long-distance runner in the presidency race and if, as the writer of that article tried to portray, Saraki’s Maiduguri trip was indeed his first step in a four-year marathon, then it should be a plus, not a minus as the writer inveighed. People with political ambitions should be encouraged to show their hands early. That way, the society gets them to act with a greater sense of responsibility than might have otherwise been the case.\n- Another difficult assertion to accept is to the effect that the distinguished senator “is fighting a battle against public perception because in many quarters in Nigeria, he has not been able to live down the feeling that he betrayed his party”. To this I say perhaps “many quarters” but certainly not majority of Nigerians share this sentiment. I believe majority of Nigerians prefer inclusive broad-based governance that reflects the country’s diversity, rather than governments that are highly skewed and based on an ideology of exclusion of sections of the country.\n- The writer’s anger was revealed the more when he stated that Saraki “remains defiant and continues to ignore the APC and PMB’s openly expressed preference that APC senators bow to party supremacy; he fills positions with members of his own group, daring the party and PMB to do the worst!” I see this as simply meant to incite. Sensible Nigerians remember President Buhari’s statement after the election of the Senate President and Speaker House of Representatives on June 9, 2015. Our much respected President took the view that a constitutional process occurred. He accepted those elected, and said that he did not have any preferred candidates for the Senate and the House of Representatives leadership, and that he was willing to work with whomever the lawmakers elected. The Presidency is a serious office and cannot issue public statements that are meant for nothing. It is an honourable office and Nigerians want to believe it ended with that. If the President goes on after that date and that statement to antagonize Saraki, that is a minus for Buhari among honourable people. I refuse to believe the hidden insinuation of that writer that our President who is noted point above is another vexatious one which stated that Buhari publicly ignored the Senate President at the Abuja Eid praying ground. To this I wail, the Nigerian President publicly ignoring the Nigerian Senate President elected within the laws of Nigeria as acknowledged by the Nigerian President! Who loses? Who becomes a smaller man by that, if that was really the case? Anyway, I doubt that it’s fact.\n- He further asserted that Saraki missed the photo-op with President Barack Obama by not accompanying Buhari to the United States. This can’t be serious. How many times have we seen Senate Presidents going on foreign trips with a country’s President?\n- That “…Bukola Saraki, unable to secure an audience with PMB, was corralling the Emir of Ilorin to service to find every opportunity for him to get to see the President.” This is commendable. He who seeks peace means well.\n- That “…he nevertheless continues to defy the same President and party in respect of the extant problems arising from his demarche on June 9.” Shaking my head in disbelief, I ask: But where is the proof of defiance to the President? Has Buhari asked Saraki to resign as Senate President? Or is this suggestive of a possibility that the statement issued after the election of Saraki as Senate President was not with the knowledge of the President? Is there a crack in the Presidency?\n- The apparently angry writer complained that OlisaMetuh of the PDP had asserted that they were working for Saraki’s return to the PDP. Now, I wonder what is strange about that. I would expect PDP to work for the return of not only their former members, but other senior APC members as well. Recall that APC lured them away from PDP. What is wrong with PDP doing the same?\n- The writer also accused Saraki of “… embarking on the next chapter of his own personal agenda for presidency…” But who, among the big names in Nigerian politics, does not have a personal agenda? Is it Buhari, Tinubu, Atiku, or who? What is peculiar with Saraki having a personal agenda?\n- The following comment in the article is perplexing: “…instead of working to further enhance the North-Southwest alliance, these shortsighted and opportunistic Northern politicians who bought into Bukola Saraki’s anti-Tinubupropaganda endanger PMB’s CHANGE Agenda and willy-nilly, have become as disruptive as Bukola Saraki and are working for his personal agenda NOT the interest of Northern Nigeria or those of our country, in the long run.” This, to say the least, is scandalous. Is Mr Kawu by any means implying that the whole essence of Buhari’s government is to exclude two of Nigeria’s six geopolitical zones? Federal Character and inclusiveness are products of Nigeria’s political history, and Constitution which the President swore to uphold. Is he stating that Buhari is implementing a policy of exclusion? That frightful comment forces one to compare what PDP did for geopolitical zones in which they did not do well in presidential elections with what the author appears to certify the APC as doing now. Is it possible that a trend has emerged with two contending visions/ideologies – those who want an inclusive Nigeria (PDP and APC elements like Saraki and Dogara), versus the APC apostles of exclusion?\n- The writer had asserted that, in his own words, “By getting Ike Ekweremadu into the loop as Deputy Senate President, and contrary to the norms of Senate in respect of ranking, also making Godswill Akpabio Minority leader, BukolaSaraki will claim his political IOU in 2019”, Not done yet, he added that Saraki will “posture as having given the South-East and the South-South recognition and platforms of relevance, when they ordinarily would have lost out in 2015, for voting against the APC and PMB.” This line of writing and, particularly, the reasoning that produced it are as unfair as they are scary. If that writer represents the view of the anti-Saraki APC, then it is saddening to note that APC still has not appreciated that the votes secured by former President Goodluck Jonathan in South-East and South-South could have been higher if it were not for the hardwork and determination of APC leaders and members in those zones. Now these valiant men and women who fought for their convictions appear to have been made to lose their voices by the emerging scenario in their otherwise beloved APC. People are asking what Ogbonnaya Onu, Rochas Okorocha, Chris Ngige, Rotimi Amechi, and others who were very vocal in asking the South-East and South-South to come along with the APC have to offer as explanation for what is happening. What sin has the South-East, the South-South and Saraki committed? If the elements of the Change Agenda of the current government is good for all Nigeria, why the fear of persons from the South-East and South-South being around even in minor positions?\n- A curious accusation against Saraki in the writing is that he “… has been appointing legislative aides from different parts of the North and beyond…” If that is the case, then he is a new generation Nigerian leader indeed. A multi-ethnic, multi-everything country such as Nigeria can no longer afford political office appointments that are skewed in clear favor of one group to the exclusion of others.\n- The writer’s vituperation to the effect that Saraki’s trip to Maiduguri was presented as a humanitarian trip to give succor to people displaced as a result of the Boko Haram insurgency was curiously meant to reduce the person of Saraki. To the contrary, it has ended up improving the person and persona. A politician must be known for something. Buhari brand appeal is in his anti-corruption posture.

Under the e-Solutions, the initiative is the e-Receipt system which is generated once payment is received from a taxpayer with a notification sent to his/her e-mail or phone number instructing the taxpayer to download their receipts and print them out for the record.\nStill, under the e-Solutions initiative, taxpayers can access their Tax Clearance Certificate by applying for the certificate online and same is received online immediately. The FIRS has continued to build on other aspects of the e-payment channels, to make it easy to pay taxes anywhere in the world, real time-all time (24/7) and also download receipts any time and from wherever a taxpayer wants desires.\nAnother feather to Fowler’s cap is his handling of the Value Added Tax (VAT) component of the Tax system and administration. The FIRS’ automation programme has reflected positively on VAT collection occasioned by the information exchange with third-party databases and other government agencies.\nUnder Fowler, the auto VAT Collection has shown a 31% VAT increase over the N25billion collected in 2017 through the new scheme. In terms of the automated deductions at source and remittance of VAT and Withholding Tax from state governments, the FIRS was able to collect N13 billion. During the year, the use of ICT and automation has facilitated the growth of taxpayers who have used these facilities from 9,574 to 59,350.\nIn administering stamp duties remittances, the FIRS imported a hundred new Stamp Duty machines to be placed in every state of the federation. The electronic Stamp Duty process has grown the Stamp Duty revenue and made it more convenient for taxpayers. In 2016, the FIRS collected N5.6 billion; in 2017, N10.9 billion and in 2018, N15.66 billion.\nThe Service made it more convenient, with the use of technology, for taxpayers to choose where their tax files reside. Now, as a taxpayer, you can choose the tax location. If a taxpayer is in Kano, for example, and for whatever reason, he/she wants the tax file to reside in Lagos, it is allowed. The FIRS has also deployed systems to all its stations. Taxpayers, unsure of how the systems work are shown how to use it to make their payments or file their returns.\nUnder the tax education/enlightenment and robust enforcement initiative, the FIRS under Fowler has the Federal Engagement and Enlightenment Tax Teams (FEETT) directorate, which continuously interacts with taxpayers to help them file and register as taxpayers, provide answers to any questions they may have in terms of ease of payment of tax.\nWith regards to greater revenue generation, Fowler has marshalled the FIRS to consistently grow tax revenue under his watch. In 2018, the FIRS collected a total of N5.32 trillion, considered to be the largest ever collected by the Service. In 2017, the FIRS collected N4.02 trillion and in 2016, N3.3 trillion.\nDespite these impressive tax revenue collection efforts, the FIRS which collects 4% as the cost of collection only from non-oil revenue has progressively recorded a gradual slide in its cost of collection. In 2016, it was 2.6 per cent; 2017, 2.49 per cent and 2018, 2.14 per cent, the reason for the downward slide in the amount that goes to the FIRS as cost of collection is the deployment of technology which has resulted in a more efficient tax collection process.\nSince 2015, the focus has been on non-oil revenue. Non-oil revenue from tax collection in 2016 was N2.149 trillion; in 2017, N2.5 trillion and in 2018, N2.852 trillion. In percentage terms, 2016, non-oil tax revenue accounted for 65 per cent; 2017, 62.25 per cent and 2018, 53.62 per cent. What this means is that non-oil tax revenue has been growing in absolute terms. Non-oil tax revenue has performed well in excess of oil tax revenue, suggesting that the effect of the diversification of the Nigerian economy by the Federal Government has gained traction.\nIn the area of VAT performance, in 2018, the FIRS crossed the N1 trillion mark. Prior to that, in 2016, the FIRS collected N828 billion as VAT; in 2017, N972 billion and in 2018, N1.1 trillion. 85% of VAT is distributed to state governments and local governments every month.\nAnother approach employed by the government but anchored by the FIRS to make taxpayers comply with the civic duty of paying tax without the use of force and to make tax payment as painless as possible, the government with the Ministry of Finance launched the VAIDS (Voluntary Assets Income Declaration Scheme) programme.\nIn 2016, the FIRS on its own gave a tax amnesty, which saw N92.6 billion was declared as unpaid taxes. In 2017, the VAIDS programme was also launched. Under VAIDS, N92 billion was also declared in unpaid taxes. In terms of the audit process, the FIRS generated N12 billion from under-remitted tax payments.\nAnother initiative introduced saw the FIRS looking at businesses/ partnerships that had banking turnover in excess of N1 billion. Under this, the FIRS found that about 6, 000 of them do not have a tax ID, did not file returns and did not make any payments. Businesses in that category have paid N21.75 billion and are also paying the balance in instalments. The initiative also saw the FIRS looking at businesses/partnerships with a banking turnover between N100 million and N999 million.\nThe Service reviewed this group category of businesses through commercial banks. So far, there are 45,361 that have TIN and are making payments. There are also 40,611 that have TIN but have made no tax payment and 44,504 that have no TIN and therefore have made no payments.\nThe FIRS similarly has another special project through which corporate organisations that own companies or properties were not found within the tax net in 2017. Through this, it generated N1.33 billion in 2017 and N2.88 billion in 2018 in just Lagos and the Federal Capital Territory. This is an exercise is expected to cover the whole of the country to ensure more taxpayers are brought into the tax net.\nLast week, there were media reports, which alleged that taxpayers’ money in the custody of the FIRS is missing. It was reported that some officers of the FIRS explored irregularities in the Service’s accounting system on Duty Tour Allowance (DTA) to collect claims that they are not due for.\nHowever, a statement issued by the FIRS on Wednesday noted that “on the DTA (Duty Tour Allowance), it claimed that some staff applied for and were granted, allowances to travel for official trips. Some are alleged not to have travelled for the number of days, for which they were slated. The EFCC is looking into that. Sometimes, it is good to have a third party investigate matters like this instead of having a staff investigate another staff. Investigation by a third party is more objective. FIRS has since taken steps to remediate this. The EFCC will soon complete its investigation. Anybody found guilty will be dealt with through our administrative process.”\nThe issue at stake in this inquiry are operational/travel funds within our expenditure budget, Fowler said.\nSpeaking further on how the FIRS operates, Mr. Tunde Fowler explained that “taxes collected by the Service are not paid into the coffers of the Service. Rather, all taxes, are PAID DIRECTLY INTO THE FEDERATION ACCOUNT, electronically, through the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN).”\nThe FIRS he said “does not have access to taxpayers money. Its operations are funded by appropriation of the National Assembly, through monthly remittances by the Federation Accounts Allocation Committee, (FAAC).\nFowler affirmed that no taxpayers’ money is missing in FIRS. “We have a relationship with the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC. We have a partnership, through which we combat evasion of taxes. People don’t want to get into trouble with EFCC. So, they pay on time.\nHe added that “FIRS acknowledges the statutory rights and responsibilities of anti-corruption agencies and other government agencies such as the EFCC, the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC), State Security Services, (SSS) to inquire into the operations of the Service.\nThe FIRS Chairman promised that “the Service would continue to give access to agencies with statutory rights and all those who seek information on the operations of the Service. Invitations of officials of the Service by EFCC, the Police, SSS and ICPC to shed light on financial transactions and operations of the Service, in the past, are not uncommon and are continuous.”\nHe noted that “the FIRS is a public trust, which we operate on behalf of Nigerians. He also affirmed that no officer of the FIRS is at large.”\nHe re-assured the general public of our unalloyed commitment to public accountability and transparency in the sacred mandate of tax collection.","1":"https://thenationonlineng.net/fowler-firs-and-more-cash-for-fed-govt/","2":"2177","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.999994278"},{"0":"Did anybody go to jail? NIS recruitment: Job, Money or Death!\nI remember sharing a bottle of drink with two of my South African friends in Randburg. I knew the self-acclaimed largest economy in Africa would come to the table for mockery. Dr. Reuben smiled and made a joke about my country-that if he needs to choose a country in the second world, he would request to come as a Nigerian. Very unpleasant statement for me, but had to put up a cool face. He said Nigerians are human beings like any other Americans, Europeans or Asians, but they act like animals. Anything goes and no question is asked in your country, Bimboo. For example, he asked if anybody went to jail after the tragedy that happened in 2014.\nI promised myself to revisit this shameless process that took innocent souls, refresh our minds about it and wake up authority, in case they are still sleeping like my new baby boy, Temidun.\nSaturday, the 15th march 2014 was a black Saturday for families whose loved ones set out to take part in the Nigerian immigration Aptitude test but never returned home… Killed in the stampede that ensued.\nMost of the applicants were told to arrive the venue as early as 7am but the test was supposedly originally stated for 3pm.\nSome lucky job seekers are alive to tell the story. According to our listeners, authorities of National Hospital, Abuja, confirmed seven persons among 67,000 Nigeria Immigration Service (NIS) job applicants in the FCT dead.\nThe applicants had converged at the National stadium, Abuja, one of the venues for the test to fill 5000 vacancies in NIS and many were said to have arrived at the centre before 6a.m.\nThe service had fixed the test nationwide for 7000 available jobs. However, a Stampede ensued at the FCT centre about 7a.m, when the screening of candidates was to start for the test scheduled for 4p.m.\nMr. Tayo Hassstrup, the spokesman for the hospital, told News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) that seven, five women and two men were brought in dead and that the bodies had been deposited at the mortuary.\nThe hospital received some casualties from the stampede from the ongoing Immigration recruitment at the National Stadium.\nHe said the hospital was stabilizing those brought in unconscious from the stampede, while other casualties had been taken to other hospitals, including Asokoro General Hospital.\nWhile, in Lagos, the thousand of job seekers invited to take an aptitude test by NIS have took control of all access roads to the National Stadium, Lagos. They started chanting anti-government songs and not ready to go home, after all, they have no jobs. So what is the need to return home!\nNAN recalls that in 2008, no fewer than 20 people died in various states of the federation during a similar exercise conducted by the ministry of interior for Nigeria Prisons Service, Nigeria Immigration Service and customs Service.\nMy questions are simple friends! Is it true people paid 1000 naira to apply to die? How much was made from this test? And where is the money? Can we have the list of the applicants that finally got these jobs? I need answers before I visit my friends soon in Randburg this January.","1":"https://thenationonlineng.net/n11-5bn-school-chairs-contracts-smuggled-into-nddc-budget-imc/Did","2":"687","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999904633"},{"0":"As many as 25 percent of people with the coronavirus may never show symptoms, says Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Director Robert Redfield.\nIn a Monday interview with NPR, Redfield said that COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, spreads “far easier” than the flu, in part because it appears people can spread the virus up to 48 hours before they feel sick, if they even show symptoms at all.\n“This helps explain how rapidly this virus continues to spread across the country because we have asymptomatic transmitters and we have individuals who are transmitting 48 hours before they become symptomatic,” he said.\nThe virus is spreading quickly in the U.S., with 165,870 cases confirmed as of Tuesday morning.\nBecause there is still not widespread testing for COVID-19 in the U.S., it’s not known how many people actually have it.\nThe federal government is urging people to practice social distancing measures, such as working from home and staying at least six feet away from others, to slow the spread of the virus and prevent an influx of patients from overwhelming the health care system.\nIt is especially important for people who appear healthy to follow those measures since they could carry the virus to more vulnerable populations.\n“So this social distancing that we’re pushing … is a powerful weapon, and that will shut this outbreak down sooner than it otherwise would have been shut down,” Redfield said.\nRedfield said he expects transmission of the disease to decrease in the U.S. in the late spring and early summer, but the CDC is preparing for a second wave to hit in the fall or early winter.\n“Hopefully, we’ll aggressively re-embrace some of the mitigation strategies that we have determined had impact, particularly social distancing,” he said.\nCopyright 2024 Nexstar Media Inc.

His time as the supreme commander of the expeditionary forces in Western Europe oversaw the successful allied attack on the shore of Normandy a year before the end of the global conflict. Under Eisenhower, Western Europe was freed from the grip of the Nazis. Later, this American soldier fondly called Ike, took his place in history as he accepted Germany’s surrender and moved on to command the US occupation zone in Germany.\nBut, according to a BBC profile, Ike wasn’t done with mere military triumphs. BBC writes: “In 1952, the popularity which Eisenhower had gained during the war helped him win the Republican nomination for presidency and then the presidency itself. His time in office was dominated by the Cold War. In July 1953, he agreed to an armistice to end the fighting in Korea… Eisenhower was re-elected in November 1956.’’\nThe historian H. A. Davies in his book, An Outline History of the World, adds more of the outstanding feats of the Eisenhower presidency: it expanded the American nation by admitting Alaska and Hawaii into the Union to bring the number of America’s states to 50. At a critical point when race relations got to a boiling stage, Ike sent fully kitted paratroopers to enforce a Supreme Court ruling on desegregation in a school in one of the states.\nBut although Eisenhower’s flight to fame found its cradle in the military, Americans and observers of contemporary history have shrouded him in ‘presidential’ robes, hardly in military drill. For, they believe, as Ike himself did when, after a victorious military campaign, he chose to go into politics; that you serve your people best on the platform of their summons through the ballot box.\nSo all through his two-term presidency that ended in 1961 and paved the way for JF Kennedy, Ike was never referred to as General Eisenhower. It was President Eisenhower. To be sure, he struck great feats as a soldier. But his martial accomplishments couldn’t take him where the presidency took him. The presidency took him to the abode of the gods on Mount Olympus, whereas his generalship held him to the ground. Eisenhower himself never sought a look into that past. For it would remind him of a discarded past, a yesterday that reminded him of a period he thirsted for fulfillment. Who would wish for a baneful past in a pleasant present? If then, the media or citizenry should take it upon themselves to dress Eisenhower in his old military garment, it would amount to driving him from the present to yesterday. It would be penalty for perceived breach of a sacred duty.\nThat is the bold point The PUNCH newspaper group was making when it announced that its titles were no longer obligated to address Muhammadu Buhari as president in view of his government’s ‘’assaults on the courts, disobedience of court orders and arbitrary detention of citizens .’’ The newspaper declared in its famous editorial with the title, Buhari’s lawlessness: Our stand:’’ As a symbolic demonstration of our protest against autocracy and military-style repression, PUNCH (all our print newspapers, The PUNCH, Saturday PUNCH, Sunday PUNCH, PUNCH Sports Extra, digital platforms, most especially Punchng.com) will henceforth prefix Buhari’s name with his rank as a military dictator in the 80s, Major General, and refer to his administration as a regime, until they purge themselves of their insufferable contempt for the rule of law.’’\nBuhari’s media gaffers and all the others rising to lambast the newspaper understand what it translates into to disconnect an old soldier from his new-found presidential love and return him to his ancient habits.\nIt’s real term demotion. It does greatly matter, contrary to what one of the media aides says. There’s something in a name in this case. A name announces who you are. It also announces who you are not, which is more important, if you ask me. If you are an elected president, donning presidential apparel but your gait, outlook, vision and conversation are incongruent with presidential appurtenances, you are a pretender. I should be worried that I am not dealing with the real man. The hood doesn’t make the monk. The hood and monk must come together to make the monk. The hood without the monk is a pretense, a profanity, a pariah. A man and his presidency must abide in the same boat. They can’t be Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.\nThose hitting The PUNCH hard understand what is at play. The newspaper understands too. It is the reason it has decided to take such a strong position. It is a fulfillment of the media’s solemn pledge to protect the people when the other bulwarks of preservation of the land crumble or are cowed into acquiescence. There must be voices to stand up in defence of society.\nOne of such voices has been Wole Soyinka, who himself has lately been recuperating from a blistering shock at Buhari’s ‘lackluster performance’. The Nobel Laureate was among the main characters that created Buhari. That’s where it pains, that what you labour to bring into being turns at you to destroy you and your community. So days before PUNCH, Soyinka began the psychological war that employs titles and prefixes to challenge leaders. Knowing how madly we adore titles, Soyinka, exasperated with the way the Omoyele Sowore has been handled by the Buhari regime, addressed the Nigerian leader thus: President-General Buhari.\nDid we notice what Soyinka was up to? He refused the president his full regalia to protest his ‘desecration’ of the judiciary when operatives of the executive were running rings around court rulings. So he, Wole Soyinka, master of literary language, also drew a circle of words around our beloved president: President-General Buhari.\nPray, what does it mean? Splitting one man into two: a general and a president! I wonder why those at The Presidency didn’t notice it to summon Soyinka to the Villa for questioning. Or did they?","1":"https://thenationonlineng.net/between-a-general-and-a-president/","2":"1370","3":"Politics","4":"3","5":"en","6":"0.9999847412"},{"0":"The Non-Academic Staff Union of Universities (NASU) and Senior Staff Association of Nigeria Universities (SSANU) on Wednesday said the unions might be forced to embark on strike if the Federal Government fails to meet their demands by Thursday.\nThe President of SSANU, Mohammed Ibrahim made the intention of the unions known while featuring on Channels Television’s Sunrise Daily programme.\nAllNews had reported that the unions had threatened a three-day nationwide protest on Tuesday over the Integrated Personnel and Payroll Information System (IPPIS) and their demands for an equitable share of the N40 billion ‘Earn Allowance’ to university-based unions, among others.\nWhile the President of the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU), Prof Biodun Ogunyemi, justified the amount promised lecturers out of the N40bn, non-academic unions have since described the Federal Government’s sharing formula as illogical and a \"divide and rule\" tactic.\nThe union kicked against the N30bn promised ASUU, saying the sharing formula was 75 per cent (N30bn) for the lecturers and 25 per cent for other unions.\nSpeaking at the interview, Ibrahim said, “The major aim of our protest is to sensitise government that look, you have a problem. The problem is that you are not honouring agreements.\n\"From agreements, you have moved to MoUs and MoUs are becoming just a charade – you sit down and take tea and the MoUs will never see the light of the day.\n“After day 3, we will meet and appraise the situation and let the world know our next line of action. But whenever you see the two unions NASU and SSANU meet, any decision we take will be in the best interest of the students and our membership.”\nThe SSANU president said the option of industrial action cannot be overruled, adding that the government caused the problem at hand.\nHe said, “In the labour laws, the strike is not an abnormal thing. We can also go on strike. But whenever you see us go on strike, it is the last option.\n\"We don’t just jump at strike; we are not strike-triggered unions, we go on strike when it becomes inevitable. I will not foreclose that if the government does not listen, which I don’t want to believe because engagement has already started, we will go on strike.\n“Government is making this problem self-induced. In the first place, if the government is serious about peace, harmony and tranquillity in the system, it shouldn’t have given the money in the name of union; it should have given it to the universities because board members of ASUU, NASU, SSANU are staffers of the universities.\n“If these monies were given to the university managements, all these hullabaloos would not be there because the right thing will be done.

Eyinnaya Abaribe (PDP Abia South) on Wednesday in Abuja, berated the 2016 budget and called on President Muhammaduu Buhari to withdraw it and go back to the drawing board.\nAbaribe while making contributions during the consideration of the budget, said the proposal was faulty on many grounds and could not be implemented at it was.\nHe said that predication of oil benchmark at 38 dollars per barrel when the crude oil price had fallen below 30 dollars per barrel made the budget unrealistic.\nAbaribe faulted the government for increasing spending by 30 per cent based on borrowing.\n“Mr President, my colleagues, this budget is indeed unique. After the budget presentation, the finance minister has never come to explain the details of the budget as it is normally done.\n“It is a budget of change I agree, but it is a change in the wrong direction.

That is the question we want to ask the people who brought this budget.\n“We know what is going on in the global economy: this budget is predicated on an oil benchmark of 38 dollars per barrel and I can now say that with oil being 28 dollars today, this budget is dead on arrival.\n“The job of the opposition is to help the government to get its priorities right, so I want to please urge this government to withdraw this budget and go back to the drawing board,” he said.\nThe senator also faulted the adjustments made in the budget as well as allocation for spending in the Aso Rock Villa, saying that it was too exorbitant.\nHe said that the adjustments rather than reduce spending in areas where they were not necessary only spread it into different offices.\n“Mr President, a budget that moves domestic spending within Aso Villa from N580 million to N1.7 billion cannot be a budget of change.\n“We were told that in the revised budget there was an adjustment due to error, we agree but what has happened is that up to N7 billion were moved from buying vehicles and spread to offices.\n“It also increased the spending that is due to renovations within the Villa.\n“They are going to renovate the Villa with N3.9 billion: what else do you want to renovate there that Nigerians will see in the Year 2016?” he asked.\nHowever, in his contribution, Sen. Ahmed Lawan (APC Yobe North) blamed the previous administration for the lack of funds due to the embezzlement witnessed in previous governments.\nHe said that this was the 17th budget he would be debating as a legislator and noted that not more than 40 per cent implementation was achieved in the last 16 years.\n“The proposal before us is the first budget where the executive has deemed it necessary to give ordinary Nigerians genuine hope.\n“N500 billion allocated for school feeding and social SAFTEY NET is commendable.\n“It is time to say oil should not continue to play dominant role as we have suffered economically and politically: it is time to diversify this economy.\n“The direction of the executive is the way to go. `That is, we should make every effort to have the real sector-agric mining and manufacturing.\n“The budget deserves the support of everyone, including my colleagues on the other side.

I noticed that a trailer was coming behind the police patrol van and suddenly the trailer stopped and they began to ask these people to come down.\n“It was then I noticed that there were some people who could not alight from the trailer on their own and the driver and some policemen helped them and brought them down. Immediately after dropping them, the lorry and the police van made a “U” turn and headed back to Head Bridge”.\n“When the day broke, I saw about 70 persons that looked malnourished, some of them were already insane.”\nAccording to him, some of the people who looked healthy started running into the commercial city after they were brought into the town, while the apparently insane ones stayed till the day break when residents of the city came to catch a glimpse of them and started buying food and other consumables for them.\nSome people at Upper Iweka said some of the people were not Igbos as they spoke Yoruba and Edo. At about 1 pm yesterday, few of the deportees were still hanging around the area.\nOne of them who gave her name as Chima said he hails from Abia State, adding that she was arrested some time in May last year by a group of people in uniform on her way to Okokomaiko in Lagos where she lived.\nShe said that she was kept in a dark room that looked like a warehouse for several days along with many other people, adding that up till the time she was brought into Onitsha, she never knew what she did that warranted her arrest.\nShe also said that many of those arrested along with her died in detention\nThe Area Commander of the police at Onitsha, Mr. Benjamin Woru said the police would investigate the incident.\nHe also said that the police would monitor the movement of the victims to ensure there would be no security breach in the commercial city of Onitsha and the state in general, especially with governorship and local government elections drawing near.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"http://www.vanguardngr.com/2013/07/70-persons-deported-to-onitsha-from-lagos/3","2":"772","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999923706"},{"0":"By Michael Eboh\nABUJA— Director-General of the West African Institute for Financial and Economic Management, WAIFEM, Professor Akpan Ekpo, weekend, blamed the Federal Government and the Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN, for the country’s current economic woes and its recent plunge into recession.\nWAIFEM was established July 22, 1996, by the governors of the Central Banks of The Gambia, Ghana, Liberia, Nigeria and Sierra Leone.\nIn an email response to Vanguard enquiries in Abuja, Ekpo, an economists, former CBN director as well as ex-Vice Chancellor of the University of Uyo, noted that the delay in passing and implementing the 2016 budget and the CBN’s monetary and foreign exchange policy stance helped worsened the country’s economic situation.\nLaments near absence of fiscal policy\nHe said: “There was a near absence of fiscal policy – the economy lacks the necessary fiscal buffers. Money and exchange rate policies were the only voice. Rather than implementing quantitative easing, the CBN was interested in tightening monetary policy. When an economy is almost in a recession, monetary expansion would help towards recovery.”\nHe further argued that the CBN’s foreign exchange framework was another policy in the wrong direction, stating that rather than implementing a robust managed exchange rate regime, the CBN allowed the naira, which is not convertible, to float freely looking for a non-existent stability and equilibrium in both the short and long-terms.\n“When a commodity is in short supply, market forces cannot determine the ‘correct’ value. The only source of foreign exchange for the economy is crude oil export, hence unrealistic assumptions under a competitive market cannot work in the foreign exchange market,” he added.\nFaults CBN’s forex futures market, other policies\nEkpo faulted the CBN’s decision to introduce a futures market within a foreign exchange market, stating that it further complicated Nigeria’s economic woes, especially in view of the fact that the Nigerian economy is heavily dependent on imports of goods and services and has only one major single source of earning foreign exchange.\nHe said: “The delay in adjusting the band of the value of the naira to the dollar, when the market provided a guide through scarcity, heightened the crisis. If recession persists, monetary, fiscal policies would be ineffective.”\nHe, however, warned that if the recession persists, monetary and exchange rate policy would be ineffective, adding that except drastic measures to reflate the economy were put in place, the third quarter of 2016 would not be different.\nLists conditions for economic revival\nFor the country to be able to get out of recession, Ekpo said the Federal Government should place emphasis on spending on capital projects and recurrent expenditures, especially in the area of payment of salaries owed workers, while also increasing its spending on power, roads and other infrastructure.\nHe disclosed that the Federal Government must assist states to pay workers owed salaries to stimulate aggregate demand, adding that the time to design policies to diversify the economy was now.\n“I hate to disappoint Nigerians, the private sector cannot get us out of the recession. Government must lead for the private sector to follow until recovery sets in. As part of stimulating aggregate demand, the social programmes in the budget must be implemented urgently.\n“Furthermore, government has no choice but to borrow externally and domestically to spend and get the economy out of the recession.\n“Our economy consumes what it does not produce, hence there is need for a re-orientation for citizens to prefer locally produced goods and services. Heavy tariffs must be placed on imported goods and services. Lending rates are just too high to revamp the real sector.”\n“Government must be strategic and think outside the box by grafting policies and programmes which would enable potential investors produce and supply both domestic and external markets.\n“There has been too much emphasis on producing to earn forex; we only need a productive economy and other things would adjust.\n‘’However, it must be noted that recessions are regular occurrences in a capitalist economy, hence the need for proper economic management in order to minimize its adverse effects.\n“There is no doubt that this recession would pass away but another one would come, for no two recessions are alike. Therefore, managing an economy is not a tea party,” he added.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"http://www.vanguardngr.com/2016/09/recession-fg-cbn-blame-economic-woes-waifem-dg/","2":"940","3":"Business","4":"2","5":"en","6":"0.9999828339"},{"0":"By Demola Akinyemi\nILORIN-Scores of staff of Kwara State Water Corporation in Ilorin commenced three days warning strike Tuesday over non payments of their three months salaries which led to the untimely death of five of them.\nThe angry staff locked the main gates to their expansive office along Sulu Gambari road Ilorin,and displayed various placards to express their grievances.\nSpokesman of the workers, Mr. Taiwo Oladimeji,who spoke with journalists said the action became necessary because they have run out of patience.\nHe lamented that five of them have died as a result of the non payment of salaries while majority of the dams across the state are no longer functioning, thereby resulting to their inability to supply water to the residents as expected.\nOladimeji also called for the removal of the General Manager who he accused of gross incompetence.\nAccording to him,”No fewer than five staff of the corporation have died due to non payment of salaries.”\n“They are owing us three months salaries; cooperative arrears eight months; deductions of union dues is one year and four months; deduction of N3,000 minimum wage two years; deduction for the building of mosque.”\n“From today we have commenced three days warning strike after the warning strike and our salaries are not paid we will embark on indefinitely.”\nSimilarly,Issa Olusesan (negotiating committee member) explained how every effort they made to make the management see reason failed which led to the warning strike.\nHis words,”This morning we are protesting against non payment of salaries, cooperative deductions, promotion and N3,000 salaries for the senior civil servants.”\n“Before now we have gone through a lot of negotiation processes; we have written many letters and given a lot of ultimatums to no avail.

Their marginalization is quite obvious/ But if the policy of reconciliation of Gen. Gowon and late/ Gen. Murtala's administration had continued, the agitation by few/ Igbo for Biafra would have been a thing of the past” –– Balarabe Musa\nIT is fiftieth anniversary of the Nigerian civil war, the war that the people of the defunct Eastern region of the country fought for the survival and sustenance of one of the world's shortest lived states –– the Republic of Biafra.\nWhile it is not surprising that the federal government is mute about the significance of the event, in that many conditions –– as Balarabe Musa pointed above –– that made the war inevitable still haunt us today, it is regrettable lugubrious(apologies to Patrick Obahiabon) that no commemoration is planned or organised by any state in the South-East or South-South. The war was declared by Gen. Yakubu Gowon's led military government on 6th July 1967 to bring the defunct Eastern region back to the Nigerian federation. The unity of the country which one of the federal war cry said “is a task that must be done!” was compromised by then Col. Ojukwu who on 30th May 1967 declared the Republic of Biafra. He did that as survivalist mechanism against what could be called state sponsored pogrom against the Igbo people.\nIgbo people living outside the Eastern Region had since the “Return March of 29th July 1966” made victims of mass slaughter. These for Northerners were in retaliation of their leaders killed in the failed 15th January 1966 coup––the coup they believed, tenaciously, to be “Igbo coup.” So, it was against this backdrop that Ojukwu's declaration of Biafra was greeted with pomp and pageantry. To an average Igbo man then, it was an epiphany of the Igbo race. But that was not to be as what started as a police action in the wee hours of 6th July 1967 turned out to be a full blown war that lasted for thirty months.\nThe events of the war were economically rendered in my poem titled “In the Shadow of Biafra”:\nAgreement suffered disagreement\nAnd canons were let loose\nRaining in the sky of Biafra,\nThe scavengers called for feast Life and death brawled in a free-for-all\nBut the scavengers had their ways\nWith their cups overflowing in the presence of their enemy,\nPsalm 23 was in their lips.\nWere these Biafrans that “heroes fight like”?\nAh! Hunger was the weapon of the enemy. Kwashiorkor came knocking at the door, And the death dominoes began to fall.\nThe grim-reaper was the zeitgeist, In the genocidal engagement\nThe rising sun hurriedly departed,\nAnd cessation was the secession.\nWith defeat in sight, on 11th January, 1970, Gens. Ojukwu and Alexander Madiebo, the commander of Biafran army, fled for exile. It was the man that the white reporters called F-young (Gen. Philip Effiong) that did the needful by handing over to then Col. Obasanjo the instrument of surrender. So on 15th January 1970, Gen. Gowon received the Biafran delegation and thus announced the end of the war on the terms of “no victor no vanquished.” The argument whether there were victors and vanquished in war was perfectly put to rest by Ojukwu himself who in the BBC documentary on the 40th anniversary of the Biafran war anchored by Prof. Wole Soyinka asked: what did he (Gen. Gowon) do to stop the victor from being the victor and the vanquished from being the vanquished?\nOne glaring indication that Nigeria has failed as a country is that fifty years after the civil war, Biafra is still on the air. This therefore buttressed the incompatibility logic always put forward by many Biafran nationalists. But if after fifty years, the people of the defunct Biafra have not been fully integrated into the mainstream of Nigerian politics, can we say they can ever be integrated? The question that successive Nigerian leadership has failed to answer is: why is Igbo people a threat to the rest of Nigerians? Achebe made us understand in his short masterpiece The trouble with Nigeria that “Nigerians of all other ethnic groups will probably achieve consensus on no other matter than their common resentment of the Igbo. They would all describe them as aggressive, arrogant and clannish.”\nA cursory foray into the Nigerian history will show that no ethnic group has contributed and sacrificed so much to the development of “one Nigeria” that our Northern brothers are now singing today than the Igbo people. Even when Zik's emergence in the Western Assembly was foiled by chief Awolowo through the infamous cross-carpeting he orchestrated, Prince Umoro Altine of Sokoto successfully emerged as the mayor of Enugu.\nZik scarified the post of prime-minister because of “one Nigeria.” Igbo people do not just live in all the nooks and crannies of this country but are also developing them as their homes because of the one Nigeria philosophy ––so where have they wrong their other Nigerian brothers? Any objective analysis of the post-civil war public policies of Nigerian State must come to the views that Balarabe Musa expressed above. This is so because we are still at war.\nFrom the 20pounds bank and indigenization policies of Gowon's administration to the present day removal of South-East from the proposed rail project of the federal government, Ndigbo are shortchanged. The problem with Nigeria and the Biafran question can be seen in the Igbo adage that says: Oji onye n'ani ji onwe ya–– 'He who will hold another down in the mud must stay in the mud to keep him down.'\nNothing will work in Nigeria so long as the notion that NdIgbo are 'defeated people' still holds water in the process of authoritative allocation of resource. To wake up the sleeping giant that Nigeria is, we must look to the direction of restructuring and fiscal federalism. That said, the governors of states that made up the defunct Eastern Region should bury their faces in shame for not recognizing the sacrifices made by all that were either killed or died in the war especially those that fought on the Biafran side. My greatest epitaph for them is to be found in the words of Robert Laurence Binyon who in his poem –For the Fallen– wrote:\n“They shall grow not old, as we that are left grow old:\nAge shall not weary them, nor the years condemn.\nAt the going down of the sun and in the morning\nWe will remember them.\nAsikason Jonathan, a public affairs analyst, wrote in from Enugwu-Ukwu, Anambra state. *Mr. Jonathan, a public affair analyst, wrote from Enugu-Ukwu, Anambra state.\nDisclaimer: \"The views expressed on this site are those of the contributors or columnists, and do not necessarily reflect TheNigerianVoice’s position.

We have done our best to look at every aspect and angle. We have tried to see what improvements that can be brought about so that the 2015 election will be free, fair and credible. Though our deadline would have expired by Sunday, we have concluded plans for targeted distribution of the remaining PVCs. All the new cards that are taken in this last phase are to be distributed at the polling unit level”, he added.\nJega said that INEC was able to surmount challenges it met in the distribution of the PVCs, especially in Jos and Owerri North, adding, “As I am talking to you today (yesterday), all outstanding cards for Edo state would have been distributed”.\nOn the feasibility of all eligible voters getting their PVCs before the March 22 deadline for collection, Jega said the commission has considered the idea of further extending the deadline, “but we are still holding back in the meantime because if we go ahead and make that announcement now people will relax. That is why we decided to still peg the deadline at Sunday. However, when push comes to shove then we can make announcement of the new date”, Jega said.\nHe noted that there has been remarkable improvement on the issue of security within the North Eastern part of the country, saying that information within his disposal showed that only three Local Government Areas in Borno state are still within the grip of insurgents.\nMeanwhile, the INEC Chairman warned that the commission would not allow Governors, Ministers, Senators and other highly placed public officers to parade the streets with armed security men on the election days in the guise that they are monitoring the electoral process.\n“This is an area that we really want the security agencies to do a better job than they did in 2011 and all the subsequent elections we have had in this country. No public officer should be accompanied to the polling unit by armed security men.\n“The Governors while going to the polling units to vote may be accompanied by two unarmed security men on plain clothes. Some of the breaches we had in previous elections were from high profile people. We want the security agencies to be more diligent in ensuring that the guidelines are complied with this time around”.\nWhile reacting to questions pertaining to the workability of the card reader machines, the Director of ICT at INEC, Mr. Chidi Nwafor, said the machines were programmed to work with all the terrestrial networks in Nigeria, “like MTN, Glo, Airtel and Etisalat, using dedicated lines”.\nHe said: “It is a known fact that Nigeria is not covered 100 per cent by the network providers, however, the unavailability of network will not stop the card readers from carrying out the authentication and verification of voters on the election days”.\nNwafor said that though the accreditation is supposed to stop by 1:30pm on the election day, he said that the card readers can still continue the accreditation of voters till 6pm.\n“The machines are not programmed in such a way that it stops accreditation at 1:30pm. People tend to get us wrong on this issue, we are not saying that once it is 1:30pm then nobody should be accredited again, no! The process will continue until the last man on the line is accredited to vote”, he stated.\nJega gave instances that could lead to the postponement of election in any given polling unit.\nHe said: “If a card reader fails to function at all at a polling unit, we agreed with all the political parties that it should be replaced. However, if it fails and is not replaced before 1pm on the election-day, we agreed that the election in such polling unit should be postponed till the next day. We have learnt from Ghana where such incidences occurred”.\nHe said that INEC is currently in possession of 182, 000 card readers, adding that 400 of the machines were dead on arrival as they could not boot after several attempts.\n“We are comfortable with the credibility of the card readers and in all the tests we have conducted none of the card readers failed”, he said.\nJega revealed that INEC will use the International Conference Center, ICC, in Abuja as its collation center.\n“If there is any result that we feel lacks integrity, we will not hesitate to cancel that result. Likewise, wherever a ballot box is snatched, we will cancel election in that place. We will work together with the police towards making sure that we prevent snatching of the card readers. If people target the card readers and start snatching them, it will constitute a sufficient reason for us to cancel the election”, Jega added.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"http://www.vanguardngr.com/2015/03/abuja-firm-yet-to-print-500000-pvcs-for-inec-jega/","2":"1317","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999923706"},{"0":"Few months after winning the Africa Cup of Nations under Stephen Keshi, Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) president Aminu Maigari says they will also be involved in selecting players for the coach even though they have no experience in coaching.\nÃ Maigari insists coach Stephen Keshi will no longer be solely responsible for selecting the squad following their unimpressive showing atÃ the Confederations Cup.\nMaigari queried Keshi's selection for the tournament in Brazil, which Nigeria exited at the group stage, and said he is dissatisfied with the current set-up.\n\"The Confederations Cup is a big tournament and that's why the other teams brought their best players,\" Maigari told Supersport's Soccer Africa show.\n\"Spain brought their best players, but we did not.

For me, it was a necessary outflow to the widespread reaction of abhorrence that followed the quit notice from within and outside Nigeria.”\n“It is my ardent hope that other quit notices that followed the Arewa one would be vacated soon. The withdrawal of the quit notice across board is one the measures that will pave way for conducive environment for national effort for placing our country in the mood for the inevitable reorganiz-ation that has become necessary for peace, guaranteed prosperity in national cohesion that visibly needed for our country’s corporate existence,” he added.\nFactional President of Ijaw Youth Council, IYC, Mr Eric Omare, told Saturday Vanguard: “The IYC is glad that reason has prevailed over emotion and divisive tendencies of the Arewa youths with the withdrawal of their ultimatum to the Igbo living in the north.”\n“However, such politically motivated quit notice must not repeat itself in the future. Those calling for restructuring and self-determination have a right to do so, hence it should not be a basis to issue them a quit notice.\n“And the way to avoid a repeat of such quit notice in the future is to address the issues underlying the inter-ethnic crisis, which is to restructure Nigeria. Nigeria must be restructured for peace to exist in the county,” he asserted.\nItsekiri rights activist, Mr. Amechi Ogbona, said: “It is a good omen for the country to be informed that the Igbo man is a Nigerian, the misleading songs on Biafra do not add value to the Igbo man.”\nREF spokesperson, Tamarakuro Owei, said: “We commend the coalition of Arewa youths for their suspension and withdrawal of the ultimatum to Igbo of Southern Nigeria and wish to say that we will reach out to our sister Niger Delta youths to do same.”\nHe, however, added: “This does not foreclose our determination and resolve to our quest for total overhaul of Nigeria.”\nLeader of RNDA, self-styled “Major-General” Johnmark Ezonbi, who spoke guardedly, asserted: “What we are agitating for in the creek is resource control, true federalism and 50 per cent derivation of oil produced from the region as it was done for the northern region. The issue of quit notice by Arewa youths to the Igbo living in the north was uncalled for and it was the only highly treasonable offence ever committed against the country.”\n“However, if Yerima and his group withdraw it, which does not mean they are above the law because the north is in command, it does not mean anything to us in the creek. What we want is unity and fairness.\nReacting through its spokesperson, W O I Ezon Ebi, the NDRC said. “It is a welcome development because we all need one another to build great Nigeria of our dream in this 21st century, where there will be justice and equity, devolution of power and true federalism.”\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"https://www.vanguardngr.com/2017/08/notice-quit-hausa-fulani-yoruba-leaders-stakeholders-ask-ndelta-militants-reciprocate-arewa-youths-gesture-2/","2":"975","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9998512268"},{"0":"The Nasarawa State Government has urged residents to always keep their environment clean to enhance healthy living and for the overall development of the state.\nMr Yakubu Kwanta, the state Commissioner for Environment, made the call during a sensitisation visit to the chairman and management staff of Karu Local Government Council on Wednesday.\nKwanta said that a healthy nation was a wealthy nation, hence the need for residents to always keep their surroundings clean.\nHe said that the visit was to appraise sanitation in the local government and discuss strategies for its effectiveness, considering the daily influx of people to the area.\n“I want to use this medium to call on the residents of the state to keep their environment clean in their interest and for the overall development of the state,” he said.\nThe commissioner threatened to deal with offenders of the monthly exercise to serve as deterrent to others.\nHe however said that the government under the stewardship of Gov.

They collected samples from the rooms on five days over a two-week period.\nThe room of one patient was sampled before routine cleaning, while the rooms of the other two patients were sampled after disinfection measures.\nThe patient whose room was sampled before cleaning had the mildest symptoms of the three, only experiencing a cough. The other two had moderate symptoms: Both had coughing and fever, one experienced shortness of breath and the other was coughing up mucus.\nDespite this disparity, the patient whose room was sampled before cleaning contaminated 13 of 15 room sites tested, including a chair, the bed rail, a glass window, the floor and light switches. Three of the five toilet sites were also contaminated, including the sink, door handle and toilet bowl — more evidence that stool can be a route of transmission.\nAir samples tested negative, but swabs taken from air exhaust outlets were positive — which suggests that virus-laden droplets may be carried by air flows and deposited on vents.\nThe two rooms that were tested after cleaning had no positive results.\n“Significant environmental contamination by patients with SARS-CoV-2 through respiratory droplets and fecal shedding suggests the environment as a potential medium of transmission and supports the need for strict adherence to environmental and hand hygiene,” the authors wrote.

The master’s degree students were from various countries including the USA, Japan, India, Switzerland, Canada, Nigeria and the United Kingdom. The Fletcher School was jointly established by Tufts University and Harvard University in 1933 as an exclusively post-graduate institution to train leaders in the field of international affairs. Its curriculum covers international law, politics, economics, and diplomacy. Its privileged students typically end up in leadership roles in governments, business corporations and non-profits around the world.\nThe teaching slides lit up with the caption: “Business 273: Emerging Africa in the World Economy. Professor Kingsley Chiedu Moghalu. Spring 2017”. The topic of the day’s class was “Foreign Investment”. For two hours, the erudite former Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) lectured and led a class discussion on foreign investment, economic policy and the business environment in emerging market countries in Africa, Asia, Latin America and the “transition economies” of Europe. He holds the formal title of Professor of Practice in International Business and Public Policy at The Fletcher School.\n‘Professor of Practice’\nPrestigious American universities confer the rare title of “professor of the practice” on leaders in their fields who combine intellectual knowledge with outstanding achievements. This Nigerian is the only black man on the teaching faculty of one of the top schools of international affairs in the world. I was a 2017 Mason Fellow and Master of Public Administration (MPA) candidate at Harvard University’s Kennedy School of Government in Cambridge, just five miles away, and both Tufts and Harvard are located in Greater Boston. In the months that I was at Harvard I saw some impressive professors, nearly all of them white men and women. Kingsley Moghalu is in a league of his own: knowledge, experience, humility, and eloquence, all rolled into one.\nI was excited when I heard that there is a Nigerian professor at Tufts University. I was even more surprised to learn that it is Kingsley Moghalu. In 2013, I spoke alongside then CBN Governor Sanusi Lamido Sanusi at the Leadership Lecture of the Isaac Moghalu Foundation (IMoF) that Prof. Moghalu had founded in memory of his deceased father. Maryanne Moghalu, Kingsley’s wife had invited me to speak at the event, and is the Executive Director of IMoF. I was impressed by the Moghalu family’s powerful vision for the education of poor youth and children in Nigeria’s rural areas, which is the mission of IMoF.\nI emailed the former CBN chief and secured an appointment to see him in his office at Tufts. After we reviewed my experience at Harvard, I decided to sit in on his class. Intrigued, I asked the distinguished professor afterwards to tell me the journey of his illustrious life. From academia to banking and finance, from economic development to international law and diplomacy, from the global stage to national service in our country, this remarkable man has made an impact as a leader and a change agent.\nEarly life: Kingsley Chiedu Moghalu was born in Lagos in 1963 as the first of five children of his parents. Nnewi, the famous commercial town in Anambra State, is his hometown. His late father Isaac Moghalu, a retired Permanent Secretary, was a Nigerian Foreign Service Officer in the 1960s. Kingsley and his parents lived first at Webb Road in Ikoyi, Lagos and later in Geneva, Switzerland and Washington DC, USA in his early years. His mother, Lady Vidah Moghalu, a retired dietician, is now a Christian evangelist. Kingsley’s Igbo name Chiedu literally means “the Lord is my shepherd” or “led by the Spirit of God”. Little-known, he also has a Yoruba name, Ayodele, given to him by the late Mrs. Fumilayo Ransome-Kuti who was a friend of his parents in the early sixties.\nAfter secondary school education at Government College, Umuahia and Federal Government College, Enugu, Kingsley graduated in law from the University of Nigeria, Nsukka. National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) assignment as a Legal Officer in Shell Petroleum’s headquarters in Lagos followed. He then worked in the late 1980s as the General Counsel of the now-defunct Newswatch magazine, the leading light of the Nigerian media at the time. But his sights were set firmly on the global stage. To further burnish his CV, he moonlighted as a special correspondent for prestigious foreign newspapers including South magazine in London, Christian Science Monitor in Boston, and Africa News Service in North Carolina (now the Washington DC-based AllAfrica Global Media) in the United States.\nKingsley was admitted to the M.A. programme at The Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy in 1990. With a letter of recommendation from Professor Bolaji Akinyemi, a former Foreign Affairs Minister of Nigeria and an alumnus of the renowned institution, The Fletcher School awarded Moghalu the Joan Gillespie Fellowship for future leaders from developing countries. The young man with the determination of a long-distance runner turned down an opportunity to become the company secretary of one of several new-generation banks sprouting in Lagos at the time and left Nigeria for Boston.\nKingsley Moghalu graduated with an M.A. in International Relations in 1992 and was appointed into the international civil service of the United Nations as an entry level officer on his individual merit. He worked in strategic planning, legal affairs and executive management roles in Cambodia, New York, Croatia, Tanzania, and Switzerland. A man who admits to having “workaholic tendencies”, he studied part-time and obtained a Ph.D. at the London School of Economics and Political Science while working as a senior UN officer assigned to The Global Fund in Geneva, Switzerland. Shuttling between Geneva and London, and in between frequent international official missions to various countries, he completed his 500-page doctoral dissertation in 12 months, shattering previous records at the University of London. As if a Ph.D was not nearly enough, he studied further at the UK Institute of Risk Management in London and became a professionally certified risk management professional.\nHard work and professional competence brought recognition. By 2006, aged 43, Kingsley Moghalu had attained the highest career rank of Director in the UN system, and served for six months in New York (at the rank of Under-Secretary-General) as a member of a high-level panel appointed by UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan to revamp the accountability, regulatory and internal dispute resolution system for the 60,000 global UN workforce and management. His interests now began to shift to the private sector. In December 2008 Kingsley resigned from the UN system, deployed 100,000 Swiss Francs of his personal savings as capital and established Sogato Strategies S.A., a risk management and global strategy consultancy in Geneva. This calculated risk later paid off in unexpected ways.\nSogato Strategies soon acquired impressive clients like the Swiss bank UBS and Syngenta, the Swiss agrochemicals multinational. Life in the private sector was looking up. But an encounter with Sanusi Lamido Sanusi at the World Economic Forum in Cape Town, South Africa in mid-2009 changed Moghalu’s trajectory. Sanusi had just been appointed Governor of the CBN. He was looking for a deputy governor to help him execute an ambitious agenda of banking sector reform after the global financial crisis. The governor was on the lookout for an executive with credibility, international exposure, and knowledge of risk management. Kingsley fit the bill. Sanusi persuaded him to return home to Nigeria as a deputy governor of the central bank and recommended him to President Umaru Yar’Adua, who appointed Kingsley to the coveted position. By November 2009, after his confirmation by the Senate, the new Deputy Governor was at his desk at the CBN heading the reserve bank’s Financial System Stability (FSS) Directorate.\nHe left the CBN in November 2014 after completing his term of office. Does he have any regrets? “No, not at all”, he replied. Does he miss the central bank? “I gave my best in service at the Bank. But, in hindsight, it was best that I moved on to other things when I did”. A man with a strong global pedigree, just weeks after he left the CBN he was appointed a professor at Tufts University and a member of the Advisory Council of the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum (OMFIF) in London, UK. In addition to his academic duties in Boston, the professor’s schedule is packed with public speaking engagements around the world and consulting assignments. He has advised the investment bank Goldman Sachs, and global private equity and asset management firms such as Actis, TPG and Eaton Vance.\nDevoted family man\nKingsley is a devoted family man. In 1994, while living in New York City and working in the UN’s headquarters, he married the then Miss Maryanne Ezike, a banker, lawyer and a daughter of the late medical doctor and former Permanent Secretary, Dr. Christopher Ezike. Kingsley and Maryanne Moghalu have four children. A short while after we left his classroom at Tufts University, Prof. Moghalu and I had a memorable encounter with Hillary Clinton, the former United States Democratic Party presidential candidate, at a dinner event at Henrietta’s Table restaurant in The Charles Hotel at Harvard Square in Cambridge. In conversation as we took selfies with the famous American politician who lost her bid to become her country’s first woman President, it turned out that she has read the professor’s Emerging Africa, and she told me that I have a bright future.\nI tweeted pictures of my encounter with Prof. Moghalu at Tufts University and it drew many positive responses. As in America and around the world, the ex-CBN Deputy Governor is well- regarded at home in Nigeria. One typical response from one of my tweeter followers, @ibsanusi read: “Kingsley Moghalu…one of the best brains of Nigeria. Unfortunately, we don’t know how to maximize our best hands.” As we left Henrietta’s Table after our time with Mrs. Clinton, the global professor inspired me as we parted. “Our country belongs to us all. We have a duty to make it better for our children and our youth”, he told me. Nigeria has not heard the last of one of its most accomplished sons.\n- Toyosi Akerele-Ogunsiji was a 2017 Edward Mason Fellow and MPA graduate of the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"https://www.vanguardngr.com/2017/08/global-leader-kinglsey-moghalus-inspirational-life/amp/","2":"2356","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.999956131"},{"0":"The Nigeria Labour Congress on Monday vowed to mobilise its members across the 774 local government areas in Nigeria to achieve victory for Labour Party presidential candidate, Peter Obi, in next year’s presidential election.\nNLC National President, Ayuba Wabba, said stated this on Monday at the National Retreat of the party in Abuja.\n“One issue that we must take very serious is actually conscientising our members and also Nigerians because Nigeria is so much divided along many primordial interests and many interests that are self-centred that we need to address,” he said while speaking about how the party can achieve its objectives and better Nigeria.\n“No country in the world can prosper and work in unity if the country is so divided. So one of the responsibilities of Labour Party is to unite Nigerians along a common goal of development and prosperity,” he said.\nOpponents of the Labour Party and its presidential candidate have often dismissed Mr Obi’s chances of achieving victory at the polls on the grounds that it lacked the needed structure.\nBut Mr Wabba has no doubt about the structures in place.\n“Let us organise at all levels. Let us send a message at all levels. I assure you that as Britain did it in 1945 when all the structures were actually won by the Labour Party and recently… Australia also did the same,” he said.\nThe NLC President added, “It’s not that we don’t have we have structures; human beings are the structures. It is just to activate the structures and put them to use. It’s just like a weapon in military circles.

Importantly, also the structures of all our affiliates, both TUC and NLC, membership together is 12 million.”\nIn his speech, the NLC President defended the youths of the country, insisting that they are not lazy and have been failed by various governments.\nMr Obi is known to have built significant support and following among youths in the country, and Mr Wabba believes that their support is critical to the success of Mr Obi and the future of the country.\n“I am so happy that the youths have aligned themselves with the structures and the struggles of the working class – we, their parents – because we are actually parents to the students and the youths because they are actually realising that agonising alone without organising cannot take us anywhere,” he said.","1":"https://www.channelstv.com/2022/09/12/2023-nlc-vows-to-mobilise-support-for-obi-nationwide/","2":"548","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999828339"},{"0":"By Henry Umoru\nABUJA—FOLLOWING sharp argument for and against holders of university degree and Higher National Diploma, HND, obtained from the polytechnics, over the qualification of the person who should man the Federal Roads Authority, FRA, the Senate was, yesterday, forced to stand down discussions and consideration of the bill.\nThe bill was stepped down till next week to enable Senator Kabiru Gaya’s Committee on Works address some grey areas in the document.\nThe heated debate came up during the consideration of the report of the Committee on Works, led by Senator Kabir Gaya (APC, Kano).\nThe bill sets out to repeal Federal Roads Maintenance Agency Act 2017 and to Re-enact Federal Roads Authority Bill (FRA) 2017 and other Matters Connected Therewith.\nThe bill recommends Bachelor’s of Science (B.Sc) degree or Higher National Diploma( HND) certificate as equivalent with COREN membership as compulsory qualification for headship of the proposed agency.\nThis prerequisite did not go down well with Senator Clifford Ordia PDP, Edo Central), who was visibly angry at what he considered an attempt to equate university degree with polytechnic education.\nOrdia, who is a trained engineer, said B.Sc holders were engineers, while HND certificate holders were technologists and should not be placed at par with each other.\nSenator Kabiru Marafa (APC, Zamfara Central), quickly fired back, arguing that the bill was discriminatory against the community of polytechnic graduates to which he belongs.\nHe also implored the Senate not to entertain the bill any further and asked that it be thrown out immediately.\nSenator Marafa, who decried the situation where the position for the director of the board should be for a university degree holder, said: “This is not in line with our tradition in passing bills.

Where on earth is a poor country wasting resources that way? he queried.\nObasanjo also said defaulting on debt repayment is very easy and convenient, which also favours the creditor.\n“Deliquescent behaviour allows the opportunity to impose stipulated sanctions and later appear friendly by offering to restructure your debt.\n“At the end of the day, what is done is simply to add to your interest payments and other fees to the principal sum at a high premium.\n“So, overnight, a debt of USD$1 million will become $5 million in spite of the fact that you had repaid $1.2 million.\n“I say this without fear of contradiction. I have borrowed from banks as a private sector operator and I have borrowed as a political leader, so I believe you would understand my fears and experience about jumbo loans and my agony in getting rid of our external debts and developing a sustainable approach to address our domestic debts.”\nHe added that to now see all those efforts go to waste barely less than 15 years is more than disturbing to him.\nObasanjo, who noted that the situation he found the government in his second coming was such that the country owed both the Paris Club and London Club a whopping $36 billion and servicing it annually with $3bn, said the situation was, to say the least, suffocating.\nHe also lamented a situation where Nigeria’s debt, which stood at $10.32 billion in 2015, has risen to $81.274 billion in just four years, stressing that the nation will need to commit at least 50 per cent of its foreign earnings to service such humongous debt profile.\n“As if this is not bad enough, we are currently seeking to add another $29.6 billion loan to our already overburdened debt portfolio,” he said.\nThe former president warned that the oil which Nigeria is banking on to pay up this debt is fast losing value, with at least 50 per cent of African countries already discovering oil and gas in reasonable quantities.\nHe also warned that getting debt relief like Nigeria got under him may not be so easy anymore, citing the case of Algeria, which under President Bouteflika tried to no avail to get debt relief like Nigeria did.\nHe said: “I fear for the future we are bequeathing to our children and to their children and their children s children.\n“I believe that it will be foolhardy, irresponsible and wicked for us to tie a mill of stone around the neck of the successor generations of Nigerians.\n“We need to take hard and important decisions that will facilitate a balanced allocation of resources to both capital and recurrent expenditures.”","1":"https://thenationonlineng.net/nigeria-sinking-under-weight-of-debt-obasanjo/","2":"1103","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999675751"},{"0":"Ekiti State Governor, Mr Ayodele Fayose has dismissed the statement being credited to him on the travail of Senator-Elect, Buruji Kashamu in the hands of men of the NDLEA, saying he never made any such statement.\nFayose, who spoke through his Special Assistant on Public Communications and New Media, Lere Olayinka, said the comment must have been generated by desperate political spin doctors to link him with what he knew nothing about.\nThe statement read; “Kindly disregard any press statement being circulated that I made on Prince Buruji Kashamu today.\n“I have not made any press statement on the travail of Buruji Kashamu today both on Twitter and Facebook or any social media platform.\n“Obviously, the comment being referred to was generated by desperate political spin doctors with ulterior motives and their motive must be to drag me into what does not concern me as a governor.\n“For all intent and purposes, the issue relating to Prince Buruji Kashamu is not political and I as a governor does not have anything to do with it.”\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"http://www.vanguardngr.com/2015/05/i-didnt-make-any-press-statement-on-buruji-kashamus-travail-fayose/#sthash.7G7jr3zO.dpuf","2":"258","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999198914"},{"0":"The Edo State House of Assembly, on Wednesday, impeached the Deputy Speaker of the House – Festus Ebea – on allegations of misconduct and misdemeanour and elected Victor Edoror to replace him.\nThis act thickens an on-going crisis which began after four members of the House were suspended on allegation of misconduct.\nAfter their suspension, the four lawmakers and five other members of the State House held a session and suspended the speaker and few other members of the House, insisting that they had been suspended without an offence.\nPrior to their suspension, the suspended lawmakers had decamped from the All Progressives Congress to the Peoples Democratic Party.

The company hinged its decision to begin tolls collection on the first toll plaza on its provision of alternative routes to motorists who may not be favourably disposed to the payment of toll.\nThe decision which is coming barely one year after the Babatunde Fashola led government suspended the initial move to toll the road, was immediately resisted by the residents and other stakeholders.\nThe Lekki-Epe axis houses both the highbrow and poor segments of the Lagos population. The reality on ground is that majority of the residents of Lekki-Epe corridor are the struggling masses – farmers, fishermen and labourers.\nThe decision to single out that area of Lagos for a Public Private Partnership PPP, and the length of time granted to the concessionaire (Lekki Concession Company Limited, LCC) to recoup their money, have been faulted by many concerned Lagosians. They are not comfortable with the contents of the agreement between the Government and LCC, the rate of construction of the road and the haste with the company wants to commence collecting tolls.\nResidents kick, plan 10,000 man march\nAlready, community leaders from Lekki are threatening to mobilise over 10,000 aggrieved protesters in 73 estates in Lekki, Etiosa and Ibeju lekki to block the road should the LCC go ahead with the plan.\nAt a press briefing at the Ikota Shopping Complex, representatives of the Residents’ Association called on the LCC and the Lagos State Governor not to create what they called “uncontrollable chaos” in Lagos with the planned tolling against the wishes of the people.\nSpeaking at the event, the Acting Chairman of the Lekki-Eti-osa-Epe Residents Association, Mr. Abioye Akerele, said: “We are peace loving people and the government should not take our posture for granted. This road that they want to toll, has been existing for over twenty years and if LCC came to add an additional lane, they cannot insist on tolling the already existing lanes.\nIt is unacceptable that those of us who are from here will have to pay money to enter our ancestral homes. It is totally unacceptable. There are over 73 villages along this axis made up of peasant people; how does government expect them to cope with the attendant rise in cost of living that will arise from the tolling?”\nMr. Akerele warned the government of the possible consequences of going ahead with the plan. His words: “We will have no choice than to call out our people to protest this move and we don’t know what that might lead to.”\nA lawyer, Mr. Ebun Olu Adegboruwa, said the government was toying with the lives of Lagosians and deliberately discriminating against the people of Eti-osa by putting three toll gates in one local government when none exists in other parts of the state where the state government is undertaking development projects. He also accused the government of not being sincere with Lagosians over the construction and tolling of the road and the concession agreement with LCC.\n“The Lagos State Government in 2005 borrowed $43million from a bank in South Africa for LCC to begin construction of the Lekki-Epe road using lands in that axis as collateral. Why are they now talking about tolling the road as though LCC is using their own money to construct the road?”\nContinuing, he said:”What have the people of Ibeju Lekki done that the governor is talking about tolling the only developmental project that this administration is undertaking here when it is not doing the same thing in other parts of Lagos? I recommend that the tolling should begin from other parts of Lagos like Surulere, Bode Thomas, Adeniran Ogunsanya, and so on.”\nAdegboruwa also disclosed that he has already instituted a legal action against the LCC, the Lagos State Government and three others. Unable to get the matter heard at the Lagos State High Court, he took it to the Federal High Court which later referred it back to the Lagos State High Court for hearing. He said that following the announcement of the commencement of tolling, he filed a restraining order on the LCC, the Lagos State Government and three others from commencing tolling pending the determination of the matters in suit no. CA/L/1170M/2011.\nAdegboruwa urged the parties, particularly the Lagos State Governor, who is a Senior Advocate of Nigeria, respect due process by maintaining the status quo pending the determination of the matters.\nIn its reaction, the LCC faulted claims made by Adegboruwa alleging misrepresentations and misinformation on issues relating to the toll gate fee.\nIn a press statement made available to Vanguard, the company said: “The attention of Lekki Concession Company Limited LCC, has been drawn to various news media reports, including on radio and in the print media, extensively quoting one Mr. Ebun-Olu Adegboruwa, a legal practitioner, who has persistently misrepresented and misinformed the public about his various claims to have a pending suit or suits in court to restrain the Lagos State Government and LCC from proceeding with the collection of tolls along the Eti-Osa Lekki-Epe Expressway, including a purported application for injunction filed on the December 2011 before the Court of Appeal, Lagos Division, also by the same Mr. Adegboruwa.”\nAlthough we have patiently observed while Mr.Adegboruwa’s misrepresentations and misinformation have continued, including his attempts to incite the public to civil disobedience and disorder, which we believe is conduct unbecoming of the noble legal profession to which Mr. Adegboruwa belongs, LCC now feels compelled, in view of his persistent misinformation and misrepresentation, to advise the general public of the true facts.”\nSetting the records straight, they company said: “On 23rd August 2010, Mr. Adegboruwa filed a suit in the Lagos High Court seeking to restrain the Lagos State Government and LCC from commencing the collection of tolls or proceeding with the concessioning of the Eti-Osa Lekki-Epe Expressway.\nHearing commenced on 28th September 2010, and arising from Mr. Adegboruwa’s denial of the existence of an alternative route for motorists who do not wish to pay the tolls, the court conducted a physical visit to the locus in quo on 11th November 2010, and recorded its findings, which demonstrated that Mr. Adegboruwa’s allegations were false for the most part, and were misleading in others. After continuing tactical delays by Mr. Adegboruwa, the Court on 21st February 2011 that is six months after filing his suit, firmly called upon Mr. Adegboruwa to present his arguments on his substantive suit. Mr. Adegboruwa was again unable, or unprepared, to present any arguments.”\n“The case was therefore struck out on the said 21st February 2011, with a verdict that Mr. Adegboruwa shall pay costs to both the Lagos State Government and LCC. Assessment of the quantum of costs to be paid by Mr. Adegboruwa, which was to be carried out by the Chief Registrar, remains pending at the Lagos High Court, as Mr. Adegboruwa has resorted to all manner of tactics to frustrate such assessment, and LCC has since petitioned the Chief Judge against such unfair tactics,” LCC said.\nIt pointed out that “immediately after his loss at the Lagos High Court, Mr. Adegboruwa on 22 February 2011 filed a fresh suit on the same facts, at the Federal High Court, Ikoyi, Lagos, seeking exactly the same remedies which he had failed to substantiate at the Lagos High Court. This case was also struck out of court on 11th July 2011 by the Federal High Court, which gave an order that the matter be transferred to the Lagos High Court as the appropriate court for such a matter.”\nFaulting Adegboruwa’s claims, it stressed that “unable or unwilling to comply with the Federal High Court directive, Mr. Adegboruwa then filed a Notice of Appeal to the Court of Appeal on 13th July 2011. However, till date, Mr. Adegboruwa failed to compile the record or to take the proper steps required for the appeal to be properly constituted before the Court of Appeal. Not having taken any such steps, but following the recent announcement by the Lagos State Government lifting its suspension of commencement of tolling, Mr. Adegboruwa then purported to file an application for Injunction before the Court of Appeal on December 7, 2011, and has continued to misrepresent to the media, and to the general public, that he has a proper case before the courts, when, in fact, he has failed to substantiate any of his cases so far, and has also not succeeded in obtaining any injunction restraining commencement of tolling so far.\nRather than properly pursue the natural course of justice, Mr. Adegboruwa has brazenly continued to resort to trial by media, and to attempting to incite civil disorder and disobedience, which behavior he was cautioned against by the High Court on January 11, 2011.”\nWhile urging Lagosians not to be perturbed with the claims made by the lawyer, LCC said “the general public is encouraged to take note of the true facts of this matter and to discountenance the misinformation and misrepresentations by the aforesaid Mr. Adegboruwa. The status quo regarding the Eti-Osa Lekki-Epe Expressway remains as announced by the Lagos State Government, since no injunction restraining the collection of tolls has been issued by any court of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.”\nObanikoro faults govt\nNigeria’s High Commissioner to Ghana, Senator Musiliu Olatunde Obanikoro described as insensitive, the announcement by the state government to collect fees at the toll gate mounted on Lekki axis of the state.\nObanikoro, in a press release personally signed, said he has followed the development since it came into the public domain and was surprised at the level of insensitivity exhibited by the state government against the tide of public outcry.\nThe High Commissioner who was Senator between 2003 and 2007 cited the toll gate controversy as a related development.\nAccording to him, “despite the absence of alternative access to road users along Lekki axis of the state, the ACN-led government has decided to inflict more pains on the people of this state. There is no reasonable and sensitive government anywhere in the world where people are not given the option to choose between toll and non-toll roads. It is obvious the ACN government has outlived its usefulness.”\nContinuing, Obanikoro said the state government will not get away with this “because it is unacceptable, insensitive, insensate and completely anti-people”.\nResidents and motorist berate plan\nAside Obanikoro, motorists and residents have been airing their grievances on the state government’s resolve to commence collection of toll fees at Lekki.\nOn his part, Mr. Yinka Odumakin called on the “government to make an alternative route for people who do not want to pay tolls.\nAccording to him, “it is not everybody that could afford to pay toll fee at three points before going to his office or house and does it mean that if you do not have money to pay, you won’t go out to find your daily bread or you have to stay indoors for the day if you could not afford toll fee”.\n“It is not responsible for government to resurface an existing road and ask people to come and pay toll fee. So government needs to open a route for those who may not be able to pay the toll fee”, he added.\nA Red Cab driver, Mr Olajide wondered why government would bring back the toll gates after demolishing them.\nAlso, a Lagos-based businessman, Mr. John Akhiemen said “I am not really surprised with the development. People were commending the government for the suspension but deep down inside me, I knew it was just a gimmick because of the election which was coming up. Is it not suspicious that the Governor waited until the local government elections last month to rescind his decision? Well, we would see how far they can go with this one, but as for me, it is highly disappointing of the governor”.\nLeader of the Coalition Against Corrupt Leaders (CACOL), Comrade Debo Adeniran, also criticized the planned tolling of the road. He described it as “a manifestation of the capitalist mentality of the ACN that will deepen the rift between the rich and the poor.”\nMr. Adeniran wondered why any government will want to turn the freedom of movement to an exclusive preserve of the rich by forcing indigenes of those communities to pay whenever they are returning to their ancestral homes.\nLagos ACN calls for understanding\nSimilarly, the Publicity Secretary of the ACN, Joe Igbokwe, explained that the Lekki-Epe Expressway was concessioned to a company, adding that the toll was natural since the company must recover what it spent on the road.\nHe called on Lagosians to demonstrate understanding on the issue. “We want to point out that alternative roads have been provided for those that do not want to pay. We believe this is fair enough to encourage competent companies to invest in our decaying infrastructure.”\nThe party’s spokesperson noted that concessioning was a way of saving funds for other sectors. “If we acknowledge that Lagos requires over $50 billion to build and upgrade its infrastructural needs, we will see the wisdom in getting companies to build, manage and transfer some critical infrastructure in Lagos.”\nIgbokwe explained that Lagos was experiencing massive population pressure everyday, which put great challenge on the resources of the state. He said the government alone could not meet the demand.\nWhile calling for understanding, he urged “Lagosians to understand that the little toll paid on the Lekki-Epe Expressway is only a little price we all must pay to get standard infrastructure and encourage others to come here and deliver better infrastructures in our state.”\nwants plan aborted\nOn its part, the Lagos State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, cautioned Governor Fashola to shelve the planned commencement of tolling on the Lekki-Epe axis.\nIt however, said the move was aimed avoid overheating the already tensed polity.\nAccording to the party, this is the period in the life of the State that Lagosians should enjoy true social services commensurate to the huge taxes they have paid to the state.\nIn a statement by its publicity secretary, Mr Taofik Gani, the party lampooned the state governor for attempting to defend what it described as “the outrageous commissions paid to the state tax consultant Alpha Beta, confirmed that the state’s Internally Generated Revenue, (IGR) is now at the highest.”\nThe party also faulted the planned tolling of the said Lekki –Epe Express road concessionaire agreement noting that the plan is “tainted with fraud and we challenge the governor to make public the full contents of the agreement for Lagosians to know if indeed it is in their interest to pay tolls.”\nReiterating its stand, it said “for the umpteenth time, we state emphatically that Lagos State and its Local Governments collect the highest federal allocations and IGR in the whole 36 states, yet at least 65 per cent of the assumed developments were done by Concessionaires, NGOs, FG; and individual philanthropists.”\nContinuing, it stated that “it should be noted that any tolled road must have alternative road. This is not the case in this Lekki-Epe Express road. The purported alternative Oniru road is through a Private Estate that can be shut at anytime as the owners so wish.”\nWhile warning of dire consequences if the state government goes ahead with the toll gate collection, it maintained that the governor has “indeed betrayed the public trust and thus no longer fit to enjoy the people’s vote of confidence.”\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"http://www.vanguardngr.com/2011/12/tension-as-lagos-govt-insists-on-toll-collection/","2":"3690","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999866486"},{"0":"….demands explanation on N18bn off-circle election budget\nBy Gabriel Ewepu\nWITH nine days to off-circle governorship elections in Bayelsa, Kogi and Imo States, the Transition Monitoring Group, TMG, Thursday, cautioned political parties and their supporters not to turn the election into ‘war’.\nThe call was made by the Chairman, TMG, Auwal Rafsanjani, during a press conference held in Abuja ahead of the elections.\nRafsanjani said it has become worrisome to see pockets of violence and tension in Bayelsa, Kogi and the Imo States, therefore cautioning party candidates and supporters to allow a peaceful electoral process before, during and after the elections.\nHe also explained that the press conference was to draw the attention of the public and government to some of the pressing pre-election situations in the three States as well as the state of the nation at large which could have a bearing on peaceful, free, fair, transparent and credible elections on November 11th 2023.\nHe said: “Insecurity in Imo, Kogi and Bayelsa. It is even more worrisome that the pre-election environment in the three states is a concern for the successful conduct of the November 11th elections in the States.\n“Assessments conducted by our partners including the Nigeria Civil Society Situation Room and Kimpact Development Initiative have reported widespread violence across many local government areas of the three States ahead of the elections.\n“On the back of this evidence that is before the public, the Transition Monitoring Group (TMG) would like to remind every stakeholder, especially the political actors, that elections are not war, but a democratic exercise aimed at giving the people the chance to freely elect and decide those who govern over them.\n“These violent conducts are undemocratic and pose serious threats to the development of democracy in Nigeria. Security agencies need to ensure citizens can vote in a peaceful electoral atmosphere across the three States.\n“Ambiguity relating to the Candidacy of the APC in Bayelsa\nFillers from Bayelsa state pointed out that the disqualification of the candidate of the APC by the Federal High Court had set the ground for violence ahead of the election in the State.\n“While it is also public knowledge that the Court of Appeal had reinstated his candidacy in the election. Has this been communicated effectively to the people of Bayelsa to avoid associated rancour that was already building up?”\nHowever, he expressed deep concern over the N18 billion earmarked for the three off-circle elections and, therefore, demanded an explanation about the huge sum, which he said the suspicious supplementary budget might be allegedly used for vote buying.\n“TMG also noted the recent supplementary budget by the Federal Executive Council, FEC, which has also scaled second reading at parliament.\n“The allocation of a whooping ₦18 billion for the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, to facilitate the conduct of Bayelsa, Imo and Kogi elections is completely shocking as INEC had assured that the funds for the off-cycle elections were parts of funds received ahead of the general election.\n“To this end, the Commission had since gone ahead to perfect preparations towards the election without any complaints about funding. What part of the election is this supplementary budget of N18 billion looking to cover?\n“Nigerians perceive this allocation as very suspicious and fear that it could be allocations to perpetrate malpractices. Hence, the federal government must explain this huge sum to Nigerians and why it is budgeting again for what has already been budgeted”, he queried.\nMeanwhile, he also expressed concern over allegations and rumours making the rounds that a purported memo from an agency of the Imo state government allegedly procuring every room in every single hotel in Owerri covering the period of the election.\n“Deprivation of Election Observers in Imo State\nIt is very disheartening to see in circulation a purported memo from an agency of the Imo state government procuring every room in every single hotel in Owerri covering the period of the election. What this simply implies is that the state government has effectively barred domestic and foreign observers from visiting Imo ahead of the election.\n“For the sake of democracy in Nigeria, TMG hopes these allegations are not true, and that the purported memo is also not true, as this would present a blow to the democratization process in Nigeria and give others in power the boldness to thwart democratic processes through barbaric acts and practices.\n“TMG urges the State Government to immediately debunk this allegation and assure observers of their safety in Owerri and other parts of the state. Also, the federal government must investigate this weighty allegation and prevail on the state government to revert to democratic tenets”, he said.\nHowever, the TMG boss condemned political parties for their failure to enlighten electorates on the forthcoming off-circle governorship elections in their states.\n“Political Parties Failure to Engage in Civic Education in the Off-Cycle Election. It is very disappointing to see that political parties have neglected their role of providing civic education toward the elections in the three States.\n“The political parties appear to have relegated this important function to the civil society while they concentrate on perfecting their rigging mechanisms.\n“This also tells a lot about how political parties perceive citizens in Nigeria and that they are more concerned about winning at all costs than engaging in clean citizens-oriented campaigns”, he pointed out.\nMeanwhile, he (Rafsanjani) disclosed TMG’s observation deployment plan, ” TMG has also concluded plans to deploy observers across all the local government areas of the three States.\n“The observers are currently undergoing training and will be deployed to observe and report through a digital on-the-spot reporting tool which has been developed. At the same time, a Central Data Centre will also be situated in Abuja with trained Data Clerks to collate and analyze reports from the field.”\nWhile speaking on citizen participation, which he described as crucial to the credible election, called on the voters in Imo, Kogi and Bayelsa “to troop out in their numbers to cast their votes for their preferred candidates.\n“Citizens must understand that democracy is about citizens’ participation and elections present the best opportunity for citizens to express their will and power.\n“Citizen’s participation especially in large numbers also reduces manipulation opportunities for the political actors.\n“Hence citizens should desist from aiding and abetting malpractices, shun vote trading and keep an eagle eye on their votes.\nTMG wishes Imo, Kogi and Bayelsa states a free, fair, transparent, violent free and credible election.”\nStill, on transparent and credible electoral process, TMG urged INEC to make its assurances on the deployment of IReV during the elections.\n“Even as INEC has given the reassurances on the deployment of IReV for the off-cycle elections, the Supreme Court judgement does not give confidence in technology as the court should have looked at protecting the greater election credibility in Nigeria.\n“Nevertheless, TMG implores INEC to look back at the credibility of the off-cycle elections in Ekiti and Osun States as a basis for improvement ahead of the November 11 election.

The worst friends we have are those enemies that claim they love us by force, Africans call Tipatipa. Yet, all species of animals protect and mourn their own from death.\nBrain and emotional fatigue have killed our sympathy and ability to empathize with those unable to defend themselves against the might of the powerful. Even those who were the victims of atrocities yesterday have become indifferent as the perpetrators today, for the fear of becoming victims again of yesterday's suffering.\nIf the Africans know the real Mission of explorers like Mungo Park when he fell deadly ill in the south-west Malian village of Kamalia, a Mandinka man would not have nursed him back to health over a period of seven months. He came back again until he met his Waterloo in the rapids of Bussa. Even the American Indians would not have rescued Columbus wandering on the sea, if they had known it would lead to their subjugation.\nHumans have evolved with a propensity to kill one another that is six times higher than the average mammal, new research demonstrated. Scientists calculated that when we first developed into modern humans about two per cent of deaths were caused by fellow Homo sapiens, according to a research article in the journal of Nature. https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/human-evolution-violence-instinct-to-kill-murder-each-other-a7335491.html\nWe witness many barbaric acts around the world dressed as retaliation, collateral damages, preemptive strikes, in defense of democracy and socialism. If these repulsive rituals for suzerainty, domination and exploitation are now at its peak in our time since the worst of World War I and II, it must not be repeated during the civilized age. Politicians are like the fanatics that use economic leverage, religions and missionaries to change the world order so that they can rule every corner of the world from Africa to Asia.\nYet humans are becoming the most vicious of all animals to completely eliminate or threaten the very existential survival of one another. There must be a blind spot for the choice of these leaders that plunges us Into deep mourning when they encourage the massacre of other human beings inside or outside our countries. The only way to become indifferent is when we demonize other people that are left to die because we cannot rescue them from our own selfish interest.\nMost of those voters do not see beyond their immediate needs. This is how corrupt politicians and big business win the trust of the Union bursters that gave them middle class privileges. The anti women politicians get women votes. Military dodgers corner military votes and hoarders of food meant for the poor that raise food prices; obtain votes by distributing the same food as stomach infrastructure. The biggest threat to any democracy is an uninformed electorate.\nHowever, looking at statistical averages overlooks those vulnerable groups that have lost their high paying Union jobs while the Government bailed out big Banks and Investment companies that gambled recklessly with Pensions and small stocks at the markets. The big boys came out richer paying a lower percentage of their income than the working class. The conservatives captured their votes by promising jobs they had lost to new technologies. The return to their good old days without the new migrants taking the old jobs. This class without a college degree make up the majority of voters and if over half of them are persuaded, the Extremist parties win.\nReplacement theory fears (Remember Jews will not replace us!) have raised the angst against the influx of migrants. They elected Right extremist leaders comforted by Christian Right. The angry working classes fell to the lower side of median, not mean incomes. They find themselves competing with minimum wage workers and new immigrants for the first time in their generation. They are the ones that lost their old income which covered all the food they want, cars and houses in the suburbs. They become part of the folks on free food lines for the poor. So, the new immigrants are seen as threats to the middle class life they had without college degrees.\nWhat and how can the majority of the world be better informed to take actions that will expose the burden they carry against their own interests? They are promised freedom of choice while opponents are violently denied. Leaders' choice is between Autocracy, Theocracy, Dictatorship. But are lured into the worst form of governance in the name of democracy! No matter how close we are in origin and history, people will exploit people. Africans should love one another the way other people do, not kill the way they do.\nWe look at how the refugees in Ukraine are welcomed at their borders by different countries around and far from them and see humanity in action. Of course, white people love one another. There is nothing wrong with people loving one another. The love did not prevent the bloody massacre that split Czechoslovakia after the reign of an inspiring leader. But look closely in Ukraine, the people killing one another have the same Slavic and Rus origin divided by political economy. The line between hate and love can become combustible and repulsive. It only takes a rancid minded partner with a killer instinct to turn love into hate.\nUnfortunately, we reason that fires are used to combat fires. Indeed, the rationale for nuclear deterrence is acquisition of nuclear power. Somehow, we rely on the judgment and pledges of these leaders not to use what they have when they are desperate. It is humans that developed the weapon of mass destruction, not only to eliminate one another but to vacate every living animal in the world. If these were other species that became so cannibalistic, humans would destroy them.\nOne of the few times we condemned people to death is when they commit heinous crimes against humanity. If these people are so out of character, it does not fit into the factors needed to be a leader. This is exactly what voters or constituted bodies choose when people we know are horrendous, become leaders. Recent research has found that individuals who boast dark personality traits, such as narcissism, can still retain high levels of cognitive and affective empathy. The study, recently published in Personality and Individual Differences, identifies these types of people as “dark empaths.”\nFarouk Martins Aresa @oomoaresa","1":"https://www.thenigerianvoice.com/news/308328/brutality-suzerainty-wars-signs-of-killer-instinct-out-of.html","2":"1331","3":"Politics","4":"2","5":"en","6":"0.999917984"},{"0":"…Ibori vows to fight till touchline\n…as final verdict maybe pronounced today (Friday)\nA state prosecutor has asked a London court to order the confiscation of more than 100 million pounds ($129 million) from Nigerian politician and ex-Delta State governor, James Ibori.\nThe popular Ex-Governor had earlier been convicted for fraud in the United Kingdom and the spent years in prison in Britain.\nIbori was extradited in 2011 from Dubai to London, where he was charged with laundering a “corruptly acquired fortune”.\nHe pleaded guilty in 2012 to 10 counts of fraud and money laundering and received a 13-year jail sentence, an outcome hailed by Britain as a landmark in the struggle against corruption.\nWith its highly developed financial and legal services and lucrative property market, Britain is a global money-laundering hub, but it is rare for the foreign kleptocrats it attracts to be prosecuted and Ibori’s case remains an outlier.\nAfter more than a decade of legal wrangling and court delays, attempts by prosecutors to confiscate funds considered to be the benefits of Ibori’s fraudulent activities now appear close to conclusion.\nJudge David Tomlinson of Southwark Crown Court has made factual findings regarding the funds.\nAt a hearing last Thursday, both sides made competing arguments about how the confiscation figure should be calculated, taking into account the judge’s findings.\nHe is expected to finalise and formally issue his order on Friday or shortly afterward.\nLead prosecution counsel, Jonathan Kinnear, told the court that the total amount that should be confiscated from Ibori was 101.5 million pounds and that if he did not pay up he should be sentenced to between five and 10 years in prison.\nHaving served half of his prison sentence in pre- and post-trial detention, as is common, Ibori returned to Nigeria in 2017 and did not attend last Thursday’s hearing.\nHe told Reuters by text message he planned to appeal against the confiscation order.\nIbori remains influential and well-connected in Nigerian politics. President Bola Tinubu, who was inaugurated in May, has hosted Ibori twice at the presidential villa, along with other former governors.\nBritain has pledged to return any money recovered from Ibori to Nigeria. In 2021, it returned 4.2 million pounds that had been confiscated from Ibori’s ex-wife and his sister, who also served jail time for helping him launder money.\nBut reacting to Thursday’s proceeding on his Facebook page, the former Delta government said his hope was “rapidly fading” for a fair hearing.\nHe also announced plans to seek redress and fight for justice in the highest courts in UK.\nHe said, “Finally, the shenanigans in the Southwark Crown Court are drawing to a close. Judge Tomlinson is due to make a confiscation order which should be both realisable and not punitive.\n“However, after what transpired in court today my hopes are rapidly fading for any degree of fairness.\n“In the 2 years it has taken to write this judgment it seems apparent that he has forgotten many of the salient points and is prioritising expediency over justice.\n“The next step will be to take my fight for justice to the highest courts in the UK.”","1":"https://thenewsguru.com/news/alleged-loot-uk-set-to-confiscate-129m-belonging-to-ibori-risks-10-yr-jail-term-see-details/","2":"706","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999713898"},{"0":"How to Create a Messaging Application from Scratch in 2025\nA messaging app is a platform or a chat application enabling users to send and receive instant messages and connect. Think of the most popular messaging apps like Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, Telegram, Viber. Which one do you use?\nAre you interested in developing software for messaging? Possibly you require a new chat app to streamline business processes inside your own organization? Or simply want to innovate the messaging app market?\nOnline communication has become a new normal these days. Communication software like WhatsApp, Viber, Telegram, and other tools that are an integral part of our lifestyle.\nJust imagine, over 100 million messages are sent out each minute globally, stated by Microfocus. No wonder why the messaging app market grows rapidly.\nAs of April 2024, 2 billion users were accessing the WhatsApp messenger on a monthly basis. It's one of the most common social apps on mobile around the world. WeChat amassed over 1.3 billion users, and Facebook Messenger amassed around 1,010 million users worldwide.\nWhy Do People Use Messaging Apps?\nCan you imagine that over 41 million messages are sent every minute? With over 80% of smartphone user engagement, messaging apps are the most popular types people use. People do need messenger apps to stay connected not only for entertainment but also for business purposes, so the segment has all the driving forces to get bigger.\nThis data visualization video shows. go., the most popular instant messaging apps based on monthly active users.\nThe current state of thing with coronavirus crisis also underlines the importance of stable, secure, and high-quality online messengers.\nIf you have a concept of creating a unique messenger, this article is a complex guide into the tech and business details, as follows:\n- what features are must-have in messaging software these days\n- advance functionality that will help you to stand out\n- tech stack to use and technologies applied in the market leaders (WhatsApp, Telegram, Skype)\n- building the revenue stream in a messenger\n- challenges during messaging app development\nGet right into the key insights.\nFor starters, let’s outline what functionality you should implement to develop a viable product.\nThese days, it is necessary to include the must-have features that would make the system work and apply some sort of innovation to make the app appealing to the target users.\nThe idea is to start a messaging app with core features and unique selling points represented by the unique experience and exciting features. The next step is to scale this chat app MVP further based on the real-user feedback.\nKEY FEATURES IN MESSAGING APPS\nLet's take a look at what core features should be used to make messaging easier in 2025.\nApp users should have the possibility to create a personal account. The wise idea is to implement a user sign-up option in one click via social media (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, Instagram).\nDepending on the app’s objectives, you may include authorization via email, phone number. For increased security, it is possible to interconnect with the device with the help of confirmation SMS.\n2. ACCESS TO CONTACTS\nFor enhanced user experience, your messaging app should automatically access to existing user contacts and get them imported to the messaging app. A strategic step is to highlight for end-users which contacts already use this messenger and give an option to invite those that still don’t.\nIt is also a wise aspect if users can engage others to join the messenger with a simple invitation.\n3. ADVANCED CHAT OPTIONS\nIt is hard to create a product on the same level as the giants like WhatsApp or Facebook Messenger in in this highly competitive market. As a startup project, your messaging app should have minimum functions to be validated. For the update and final deployment, think of advanced options that will bring value. Integrating top social channels and developing a more personalized user experience can help your product succeed on the market.\n4. EXCHANGE MESSAGES AND FILES\nThese days, users need to have the possibility to exchange files, videos, photos, and other content. Therefore, make sure that your messaging app supports different app attachments.\nThis feature can be implemented by using distinct APIs. Do not forget that your app should have an option to send files from the device and capture real-life moments from the app directly.\n5. SHARING REAL-TIME LOCATION INFORMATION\nUsers can share their location with others in many apps, like parking spots, offices, restaurants, etc. This feature is developed by utilizing packages of Location Manager Class on iOS and Android.\nTelegram messenger has implemented this feature, which provides excellent user experience. App users can even create routes from the starting to the destination point.\n6. PUSH NOTIFICATIONS\nIt is an essential element in any messaging app development. It is the function that allows the user to check whether someone sends a message or not. Developers use Google Cloud Messaging and Apple Push Notifications to implement this functionality.\n7. CLOUD STORAGE AND BACKUP\nTo generate user satisfaction and get user retention, your application needs to be customizable. The users do like the idea of playing with app interfaces, themes, and colors to make it more personalized and attractive. Keep this in mind when comprising the app functionality list.\nTOP 7 most secure messaging apps in 2025\nDigital technologies are all about making life comfortable, but at the same time, it is about security concerns. Sharing messages, photos and files may not be safe especially if the platform is not powered by security technologies. Today there are secure messaging apps with end-to-end encryption built on blockchain technology that is absolutely safe and secure. Still, before thinking of making a secure app, consider whether it meets your business objectives or not.\nDo you want to know which are the most secure messaging apps out there and how they can protect your valuable data? We compiled a list of reliable encrypted messaging apps because the struggle to keep our data secure is fiercer than ever.\nTECHNOLOGY STACK TO BUILD APPS LIKE WHATSAPP AND TELEGRAM\nFirst, we list possible tech stacks to utilize in chat app creation, followed by for a few successful messaging apps. It makes sense to understand how these applications are created.\nWhatsApp tech stack\nThe Technical Stack used to develop WhatsApp includes Erlang, FreeBSD, Yaws, PHP, and XMPP.\n- Erlang - functional language used to script real-time chat apps.\n- FreeBSD - open-source operating system to power modern servers and embedded platforms.\n- Yaws - Erlang-based web server used for dynamic-content apps to run WhatsApp as a standalone web server.\n- PHP - general-purpose scripting language for web development.\n- XMPP - the communication protocol - the core of WhatsApp for sending real-time messages.\nLet’s dive right into these insights.\nTECH STACK TO BUILD YOUR MESSAGING APP\nDepending on your product’s goals and functionality, you should understand creating a cross-platform or native messaging app. The difference lies in the app availability of the app across the majority of platforms simultaneously or individually for each operating system.\nBoth options have their pros and cons. Native app development ensures higher system performance, stability, security but requires more investments.\nMOBILE APP DEVELOPMENT\nAndroid | iOS | |\nProgramming language | Java, Kotlin | Swift, Objective-C |\nLocal Storage | Core Data | Shared Preferences |\nPreferences | User Defaults | Shared Preferences |\nSocial Authentication | Facebook SDK | |\nChat | Starscreen | OkHttp |\nVideo and voice calls | WebRTC | WebRTC |\nProgramming language | Java, Java, HTML5, CSS3 |\nAutomation frameworks | RSpec, PhantomJS |\nSQL data storage | PostgreSQL |\nSocial Authentication | Facebook SDK |\nWeb server and web application server | Nginx |\nHosting | Amazon Web Services |\nKey Value storage | Redis |\nServer-side software can be coded in PHP, Ruby, Erlang, and similar. Your software development vendor should advise you of what is more suitable to use in your case.\nAlso, one of the most common product architectures is a software bundle of LAMP. Linux as the operating system, Apache- web server, MySQL database, PHP as a back-end language.\nIt is also necessary to use distinct services and libraries, namely:\n- Amazon services - for data storing\n- Socket.io - library for real-time communication between a browser and server\n- Social media integration - Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, etc.\n- Analytical tools - Flurry, Google Analytics, Firebase, MixPanel, etc.\n- Maps & Navigation - Google Maps, Google Places\n- SMS services - Twilio\n- Email marketing - MailChimp, Elastic emails\n- Payment gateways - Braintree, Stripe, PayPal, etc.\n- Push notifications - APNS (iOS), FCM (Android)\nThe general idea is to go for open-source technologies, which prevent building everything from scratch. Instead it is possible to use existing well-proven libraries and frameworks.\nWhen selecting a tech stack for your messaging app, put users and their experience in a priority and consider the speed, performance, and security of the chat app.\nTECHNOLOGIES USED TO BUILD A WHATSAPP MESSAGING APP\nOperating system FreeBSD is used in this app. Its developers believe that the Linux system is more bug-creating, which is a somewhat debatable statement.\nInitially, the system used XMPP (Extensive Messaging, Presence Protocol) to manage one-to-one and group communications. Further, the team created the internal protocol to support communication with end-to-end encryption.\nWhatsApp uses YAWS (Yet Another Web Server) for data storing and HTML5 WebSockets to create a solid connection between a server and messenger.\nThe system uses LYCE/LYME architecture consisting of open-source solutions to develop highly available and dynamic pages.\n- Operating system- Linux\n- Web server – Yaws\n- Databases – Mnesia, CouchDB\n- Programming language- Erlang\nTo note, Elixir programming and its Phoenix framework are great to utilize for complex and high-load projects. These technologies ensure smooth system operation, remarkable efficiency, and the ability to handle lots of traffic.\nTECH STACK WITHIN THE TELEGRAM APP\nTelegram is one of the most significant messaging apps with the high protection and smooth performance. As far as it is known, the messenger was coded with the following technologies:\n- iOS app – build by utilizing Objective C and partly Swift\n- Android app – created with Java programming language\n- Windows Phone app – uses C#\n- Mac app – is developed with Objective C\nAlso, the Telegram team developed a specific data protocol, MTProto Mobile Protocol, that ensures the speed and security of its service.\nTECHNOLOGIES UTILIZED IN THE SKYPE PRODUCT\nBefore Microsoft purchased Skype, the product used C++ for the back-end in Debian servers. Further, the team included new services by using Azure Suite (written in C#).\nThe client Skype apps include the C library to support the low-level app functionality. To mention, Skype is a cross-platform product, and only a thin layer of client apps (UI layer) uses Java and Objective-C for Android and iOS apps correspondingly.\nCHAT APP MONETIZATION STRATEGIES\nHow can you monetize your messaging application?\nWe have an answer for you with a few options to build revenue streams in this app type. These strategies include:\n- In-chat advertising – these are multiple ways to include ads inside the messaging application. This can be a banner ad, pop-up ad, native ad, and similar. Viber messenger uses this strategy and shows targeted ads and messages and earns millions.\n- In-app purchases – this model implies users pay for some advanced app features, access specific content, remove the ads in the messaging app, purchase sticker packs or games. The latter option is used in the LINE chat app, where users play right in the messenger.\n- In-app payments – corresponds to the typical monetization strategy, where users make payments inside chat applications.\n- Integration of a chatbot – this is an advanced monetization possibility once your app gets user interest and base. It allows you to gain revenue from CTR (click-through rate) by providing relevant recommendations.\n- Sponsorship – in this model, revenue is generated via in-app sponsorship to create brand awareness. This method is best to utilize once you have enough pull of app users.\n- Pay per download – you may use this method if you are sure to provide a unique and new app functioning, and you tested the hypothesis that users will purchase the app. In general, users buy only those apps that are very specific and have top performance.\n- Subscription fee – similar to pay per download, but the payment is made regularly, only when clients use a messaging app (e.g, monthly, annual basis). Interesting fact, that the WhatsApp initial cost $0.99 per year after a trial period.\n- Content merchandising - creating chat themes, wallpapers and stickers related to any brand. The promotion of the brand brings win-win results for the app and the brand.\n- Official accounts - this type of messaging app is built for brands, public figures or celebrities who are willing to get close interaction with followers.\n- White labelling - this strategy supposes chat app development for enterprises’ internal use or customer support.\nEither method you select, base your monetization strategy on the market analysis, current user experience. Also, these days users demand top-notch app performance and service quality to pay for it.\nOur team is ready to help you build intelligent technology solutions to get your brand closer to your potential customers with a chat app. Get in touch with our team, and we’ll provide you with a free initial consultation and project estimate.\nHow much does it cost to build a messaging app?\nRegardless of the application type, the development cost is estimated based on its complexity and features. Even if you try to make a rough cost estimation, we still need to consider details like platform, app complexity, development team and hourly rates. The average price for MVP starts from as low as $25,000 or as high as $50,000.\nDrop a line for a free consultation, and mobile application cost estimation, and our team will get back to you with an offer.\nCHALLENGES OF BUILDING A CHAT APPLICATION\nBefore you proceed with the actual development of the messaging app, consider the following challenges on the way and further. This information will help overcome pitfalls and remove risks and future troubles in a messaging app functioning.\n1. DEFINING REAL-TIME FEATURES\nThe industry of messaging apps is led by giants that have raised the bat and, to tell the truth, it will be hard to compete with them. On the other side, we have users that demand new features, stability, and functionality. To become a competitor, the messaging app should be way much more than a chat app. After a successful launch of MVP, think of all the features for user satisfaction:\n- Custom fonts and stickers\n- Chat muting\n- Privacy status updates\n- Video and voice calls\n- File transfer\n2. SECURITY ISSUES\nHigh-end app security and protection is the number one task during messaging app development. It is necessary to provide personal data protection, message encryption, and build secure project architecture.\nEnsure that you provide as much protection as possible, namely:\n- end-to-end encryption via protocols (e.g XMPP)\n- usage of cryptographic keys\n- plan the product architecture for secure data storing\n- include privacy policies when using your chat app\n- develop extra functionality, which users can enable, for messenger protection\n3. THE TOOL STACK\nTo make your app work, it should first be well packed and built. Think of existing apps and find case studies that will help to define the tech stack best working for your project.\n4. OVERLOAD OF THE SERVER\nThis issue may arise with the growing number of app users. Optimization of an app like WhatsApp requires loads of technical efforts and capable developers.\nChoose the server setup and capacity, also supported by proper hardware, to quickly ensure app scalability. Make sure that servers are tuned up to provide stable work during the peak load periods.\nIt is highly recommended to plan and create a list of potential server bottlenecks with a precise action plan.\n5. FLAWLESS APP UPDATES\nMessaging apps have a constant connection with their users and constantly process their data. During new functionality deployment and app updates, make sure not to lose existing data by servers and architecture configuration.\nScalability of the real-time chat apps is a rather challenging assignment, which is highly dependent on the set architecture.\n6. STABLE CONNECTION\nMany reasons can influence the network loss and switch from smartphone internet and Wi-Fi. To note, during such losses, the last message can be lost in case of a temporary disruption.\nThus, you should create your messaging app to outline your app as a reliable tool that keeps the connection stable and reproduces lost messages during disconnection.\nHOW LONG DOES IT TAKE TO DEVELOP A CHAT APP\nThe timeline required to develop your messaging app depends on several factors. These include but are not limited to:\n- number of platforms you plan to build your product for\n- the complexity of features and design\n- number of features included\n- attributes of the selected software development vendor (location, rates)\n- number and peculiarities of 3rd party services to integrate\nAny software development consists of special services like UX/UI design, Architecture planning, iOS development, Android development, Backend development, Quality Assurance, etc.\nIn general, be prepared that it takes around 3-5 months to develop an MVP of the chat app. Note that in most cases, this involves only basic app functionality. In terms of the budget, the sum is highly dependent on the development vendor you choose.\nThe 3-5 month of development corresponds to $25,000 – $50,000 for one platform (iOS or Android). At this cost, usually, you receive a team of 4-6 specialists like iOS/ Android developer, Backend developer, QA engineer, Project manager, Designer.\nTo visualize what to expect, here is a chart with development time per feature. Keep in mind that we are discussing MVP features for the first launch. Later the app may be updated with new functionality.\nApp Features | Development Time |\nUser registration | 12-16+ hours |\nThe messaging feature | 200+ hours |\nMultimedia file transfer development | 12-16 hours |\nContact sharing | 8 hours |\nLocation | 8+ hours |\nVoice and video calls | 200+ hours |\nEstablishing settings | 8 hours |\nUX/UI design | 100+ hours for prototypes |\nThus, plan your timeline and budget accordingly. A wise strategy is first to finalize your product concept, business vision and prioritize app functionality.\nCONCLUDING IDEAS FOR CHAT APP DEVELOPMENT\nOnline communication is a core part of our daily life – 80% of adults, 91% of youngsters text each day. This area will evolve and innovate each year, which has a vast potential for your investment today. The more modes of communication exist, the greater social satisfaction is.\nHere is a short case study for more practical information about the messaging app and the development experience. The expertise of Addevice covers the development of different apps, including entertainment and messaging. One of the relevant projects was “WOO – Women’s dating platform app,” a dating app and messaging platform to get connected.\nThe MVP of the app was built on stakeholder requirements based on the following tech stack:\n- Swift, Java\n- CoreData, Socket.IO, Game KIT\n- MongoDB, Java, Big Data (Hadoop, Casandra)\n- AWS and AWS File Storage\nThe chat applications business model\nIn the first stages of project planning and defining the business model, a significant portion of decision-making goes to research and case studies. For messaging apps, the best working model of messaging apps so far is WhatsApp. It means when building your messaging app business model.\nAs an alternative to SMS messages, WhatsApp became the second chat app globally for being secure, private, and reliable. The first funding of WhatsApp was equal to $250K; the next two investments were the most significant, about $60 million that was the primary source of income for WhatsApp employees for a long time. Later, WhatsApp was acquired by Facebook as a valuable asset and started implementing new business projects. As a recent strategic change, Facebook launched the WhatsApp Business application and API allowing businesses to integrate WhatsApp for business purposes.\nThe Customer Journey Map\n(what are the critical problems faced by your customers?)\n- Users can’t keep in touch with the nearest and dearest ones while they are apart\n- Expensive phone calls & SMS\n(what are your solutions for your customers’ problems?)\n- Cheaper SMS & voice calls via the internet\n(what value do you deliver to your customer?)\n- Free application\n- Real-time messenger\n- Be reachable by everyone\n- Simple, intuitive interface\n- Secure messaging\n(which metrics indicate how well your company is doing)\n- Monthly active users\n- Customer retention rate\n- Audience engagement\n(Though which channels do your customer segments want to be reached?)\n- Word of mouth advertising\n- WhatsApp web application\n- App Store/Google Play\n- Social Media\n(who is your intended customer?)\n- Families and friends who are apart but have smartphones to stay in touch\n(what is your edge over competitors?)\n- First app to market\n- Technology solutions\nFOLLOW THE NEXT PROCEDURE WHEN STARTING A MESSAGING APPLICATION\n- Prepare a solid and complex market analysis.

And in VERSES 29-30, Apostle Paul questioned, and I quote, ‘’Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers?\nAre all workers of miracles? Have all the gift of healing? DO ALL SPEAK IN TONGUES? DO ALL INTERPRET? It is clear, therefore, that not all believers in christ have the gift of speaking in tongues.\nAnd even those who have the gift of speaking in tongues are advised, in 1 CORINTHIANS 14:13, to pray that they may be able to interpret, otherwise if they cannot interpret, or if there is no other, in the church, to interpret, then such believers in Christ are warned to keep silence in the church, as written in 1 CORINTHIANS 14:28, and I quote, “BUT IF THERE IS NO INTERPRETER, LET HIM KEEP SILENCE IN THE CHURCH; AND LET HIM SPEAK TO HIMSELF AND TO GOD.”\nOtherwise, if the unlearned or unbelievers, come into the church, and hear them speak in an unknown tongue, which they do not understand, they will say they are mad, as we can read in 1 CORINTHIANS 14:23, and I quote, “IF THEREFORE, THE WHOLE CHURCH COME TOGETHER INTO ONE PLACE, AND ALL SPEAK WITH TONGUES, AND THERE COME IN THOSE WHO ARE UNLEARNED OR UNBELIEVERS, WILL THEY NOT SAY THEY ARE MAD?” And they will even be like barbarians unto them, as written in 1 CORINTHIANS 14:11, and I quote, “THEREFORE, IF I KNOW NOT THE MEANING OF THE VOICE, I SHALL BE UNTO HIM THAT SPEAKETH A BARBARIAN, AND HE THAT SPEAKETH SHALL BE A BARBARIAN UNTO ME.” Speaking in tongue, without any interpretation is like speaking into the air, as written in 1 CORINTHIANS 14:9, and I quote, ‘’SO LIKEWISE YE, EXCEPT YE UTTER BY THE TONGUE, WORDS EASY TO BE UNDERSTOOD, HOW SHALL IT BE KNOWN WHAT IS SPOKEN? FOR YE SHALL SPEAK INTO THE AIR.’’\nOn the day of Pentecost, the tongues that were spoken, by the apostles and the other disciples, numbering about one hundred and twenty (120 ), were tongues of men, spoken in different languages of the different countries of the world, from whence came all the Jews to Jerusalem to observe the Pentecost. Pentecost was a Jewish festival, held on the fiftieth day after the Jews Passover.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"https://www.vanguardngr.com/2018/07/do-all-speak-in-tongues/","2":"744","3":"Religion","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999923706"},{"0":"There were indications yesterday that the Federal Government may exempt Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, NNPC, and several other agencies from the Treasury Single Account, TSA, policy.\nIt was learned that the decision to exempt the agencies from TSA was reached after a meeting of officials of the affected agencies with the Accountant-General of the Federation, Alhaji Ahmed Idris and Directors in his office.\nSources told Vanguard that President Muhammadu Buhari had been fully briefed by the AGF on why some agencies had to be allowed to receive revenue into bank accounts other than the TSA.\nIt was disclosed that the agencies’ operations would be hampered if all their revenues were to be paid into the Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN, before they secure approvals through the bureaucracy to make withdrawals to finance such operations.\nAll affected agencies are commercial organizations.\nIn addition to NNPC, it was learned that Bank of Industry, BOI, Federal Mortgage Bank, Bank of Agriculture, Urban Development Bank, Nigeria Export Import Bank, Nigeria Independent Power Project, NIPP, Galaxy Backbone and Nigeria Railways were equally exempted.\nPresident Buhari’s administration has been under tremendous pressure over the TSA.\nBanks fear that it would adversely affect their operations should all Federal Government funds be pooled into the apex bank.\nThe quasi-commercial entities also mounted pressure on government as they argued that the TSA would not allow for the smooth operations of their organizations.\nAs learned, when the guidelines are announced by the AGF, there could be a long list of many departments and agencies of government that would be exempted from the policy.\nHowever, the AGF had repeatedly said that there would be no going back on the implementation of the policy.\nHe told journalists last weekend that the detailed guidelines would be announced within a short time.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"https://www.vanguardngr.com/2015/09/fg-to-exempt-nnpc-others-from-tsa/","2":"388","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9998378754"},{"0":"A Nigerian player has been fired by a club in Slovenia for impregnating the daughter of the president of the second division outfit after just six months with the side.\nThe player, whose name has been withheld, said he was fired for 'gross misconduct and indiscipline' over the pregnancy which he has claimed full responsibility.\nFour Nigerians are registered with second tier clubs in Slovenia with Bede Osuji, Temitope Nelson, Gerald Chiyoke and Sulaiman Adedoja playing in that league but it is uncertain which of them is involved in the pregnancy issue.\nThe player, who fears public backlash over the situation, has returned to Nigeria after his ordeal and he is worried over the girlfriend and her pregnancy.\nThe player is considering FIFA action against the club following the decision to sack him over reasons he feels are unjustified after joining the club just in May.\n\" I signed a three year deal with the option of another year but last month I ran into trouble when my girlfriend who happens to be the daughter of the president said she was pregnant for me\", he said.\n\" The club got to know about it and summoned me for a meeting.

It is very disheartening that our national economy has been driven into perhaps the worst state in all of our national history.\n“We have seen our government spend more money on car parks for politicians than for the running of half of our teaching hospitals. In all this, there has been scanty attention to the living conditions of the ordinary people they were elected to care for.\n“The huge amounts of borrowed resources that should have been channeled into production, especially food production, to guarantee an abundant supply of food in the nation, were rather consumed on inanities, rather than invested. Today, we are one big nation united by hunger and starvation, to the point of dying to make ends meet. Again, I strongly urge the government to lead the crusade against hunger by investing aggressively in our agricultural sector.”\nReacting to Obi’s tweets, Omokri said it seemed Obi is always happy when bad things occurred in the country.\nOmokri tweeted: “Nigeria’s GDP grew by 3.4%, Obi did not react.

The Nigerian military, under pressure because of a presidential election to be held this month, has recently claimed a string of successes against Boko Haram, boasting about the recapture of a number of towns.\nThe mercenaries “are in the vanguard in the liberation of some of the communities,” the official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals.\nA senior Western diplomat confirmed that the South Africans were playing “a major operational role,” particularly at night.

This requires a trained hand to perform and some portion of the false negatives arises from improper procedure.\nBut even if done correctly, the swab may produce a false negative. That’s because as the disease progresses, the virus passes from the upper to the lower respiratory system.\nIn these cases, the patient may be asked to try to cough up sputum — mucus from the lower lungs — or doctors may need to take a sample more invasively, when a patient is under sedation.\nDaniel Brenner, an emergency physician at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, described to AFP taking a test after performing a procedure called a bronchoalveolar lavage.\nThis was done on a patient whose nasal swab returned negative three times, but who showed all the signs of COVID-19.\nEventually, the patient’s medical team placed a camera down his windpipe to examine the lungs, then sprayed fluid in and sucked out the secretions, which were then tested, resulting in a positive.\n– No perfect test –\nUncertainty in clinical diagnoses is not new, and clinicians are well aware that no type of test for any condition can be considered perfect.\nWhat makes COVID-19 different is its newness, said Sampathkumar.\n“Most of the time when you have tests, you have test characteristics outlined carefully and warnings about tests interpretation,” she said.\n“We had no test for so long, and when we got the test, we started using it widely and sort of forgot the basics.”\nAfter being slow to start mass testing, the US has ramped up production and has tested almost 2.5 million people, with pharmacists now authorized to carry out the procedure.\nBut “the real fear of that is people who are given a false negative test and then decide that they’re safe to go around their daily life and go out and expose people,” said Brenner.\nMuch hope is placed on newly available serological tests which look for antibodies produced by a person’s body in response to the virus and can tell whether a person was infected, long after they recovered.\nThey could also be used to help diagnose a person who is currently infected but whose PCR test results showed a false negative, by waiting a week or so for the body to produce its immune response.\n“We are excited about the serologic test, but we don’t know how well it will work and we are starting to study it,” said Sampathkumar.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"https://www.vanguardngr.com/2020/04/how-false-negatives-are-complicating-covid-19-testing/","2":"1045","3":"Health","4":"3","5":"en","6":"0.9999637604"},{"0":"President Muhammadu Buhari\n…Gives 2 notice to US Secretary of State to act, threatens to apply for WRIT of Mandamus if no action upon Expiration\nBy Dapo Akinrefon\nA United States-based group, Global Advocates For Terrorism Eradication, GATE, on Friday, petitioned the office of the United States Secretary of State, Antony J. Blinke, demanding that the United States Government should designate some Nigerian Government officials as sponsors of terrorism, alleging that “from all available indices, what is happening in Nigeria is State-sponsored Terrorism”.\nGATE said its core objectives are to stop the provision of material support, funding and prosecutorial protection of terrorists by state actors.\nIn a statement by its Principal Advocate, Robert Berry, the 26-page petition alleged that the Nigerian government was allegedly sponsoring terrorism by carrying out terrorist activities including training, fundraising, financing, and recruitment of terrorists and terrorist activities.\nThe organization said that “the Nigerian Government officials have deployed the instrumentality of power and are using the veil of sovereignty in knowingly consenting and with malicious intent allowing and promoting the use of Nigeria as a breeding ground and recruitment nursery for international terrorism activities contrary to foreign relations authorizations act fiscal years 1988 and 1989 (P.L.100 to 204:22 U.S.C 2656f), as amended.”\nThe letter chronicles numerous terrorist activities that establish the culpability of the Nigerian govt and its officials. Some of those acts include providing funds to terrorists and terrorist organizations; providing material support including weapons and equipment to terrorists, actively and expressly encouraging and inciting terrorist activities.\nOther allegations against the Nigerian Government are prosecutorial protection to terrorists by directly engaging in acts of terrorism and extrajudicial killings, using security agencies.\nGATE, in the petition, accused the present administration of aiding terrorism in Nigeria.\nThe group stated that the US Government designating Nigerian officials as sponsors of terrorism will have far-reaching legal implications, including potentially arrest and criminal prosecution in a federal US court if they visit the country.\nThe petition reads in part: “The balance of terror of government’s false narrative has further exposed the complicity of the Nigerian Government in the anti-Christian butcheries and its monumental failure in discharging its constitutional duties of protecting and safeguarding the citizens irrespective of their religion, tribe or creed.\n“The Government has not only failed to provide official credible data of the killings, maiming and Christian properties destroyed or burnt but also undermined, mangled and denied same when independently presented.\n“The Government has also failed woefully in letting Nigerians and the International Community know, with verifiable statistics, the proportionality or dis-proportionality of such interfaith asymmetric killings, maiming and destroyed or burnt or lost properties.\n“That is to say that there are no credible data from the present central Government of Nigeria or its security and law enforcement agencies including Nigeria Police Force and Defense or Army Headquarters, showing the percentage or number of attacks against defenceless Christian communities by the state-backed and protected Jihadist Herdsmen or reprisals by the victim Christian communities, if any.\n“In other words, there are no credible Government’s records or from its security and law enforcement agencies showing the number of attacks against Christians since mid-2015 by Jihadist Herdsmen, number of Christians killed, a number of their lands seized and occupied by the Jihadists and number of Christians’ properties including dwelling houses, worship and learning centres destroyed or burnt or lost to Jihadist Herdsmen.\nGovernment or security or law enforcement records are near totally absent, if not totally absent regarding the number of Jihadist Herdsmen arrested and investigated, convicted and jailed since mid-2015 for killing Christians or seizing or destroying their properties especially their sacred learning and worship centres. Independent records have continued to indicate that such perpetrators are often not arrested but shielded by the security forces.\n“On the other hand, there are also no credible records from the same Government or its security and law enforcement agencies showing the number of attacks against Jihadist Herdsmen or Fulani citizens or settlements by the victim Christian groups or communities, number of Fulani citizens killed, number of their lands seized and occupied, number of Fulani properties including dwelling houses, Mosques and learning centres destroyed or burnt by same Christian avengers.\n“On our part and independently speaking, the evidence on the ground grossly shows the contrary or contradicts all the Government claims. Apart from attacks on Christians in Nigeria being brutally asymmetric or ‘98%/2%’ ratio; or radical Islamists’ attacks or violence against Christians 98% and reprisals against such attacks or violence 2% or less; the Nigerian Government, adding to its monumental failure to protect Christians and fish out and punish their attackers, has also repeatedly repelled such reprisals if rarely risen or rarely about to occur.\nUnder the same Government, any reprisal killing of Herdsman is given the widest media attention locally and internationally; with the wheel of justice speeded up against the perpetrator(s). But when Christians are massacred, Government rolls out industrially its media censorship and inaction including aiding and abetting; for purpose of dwarfing or mangling the same.\n“Both in principle and in practice, the present Government of Nigeria has provided and still provides maximum protection for Fulani settlements and their jihadist groups and turned and still turns blind eyes, including little or zero response, to an early warning or distress calls on the side of the persecuted Christians and their properties, especially when under attack or about to be attacked.\n“Naturally, individual or group victim citizens’ reprisals become inevitable when governing or securing authorities woefully failed in their duties to protect them and go after their attackers; or whereby same governing or securing authorities take sides and shield the perpetrators and cover up their atrocities.\n“In the case of persecuted Christians and their communities in Nigeria or any part thereof, they have remained substantially pacifist, nonviolent, peaceful and law-abiding; allowing themselves to be massacred at will; only for the same Government and its security and law enforcement agencies especially the Nigerian Army and the Nigeria Police Force to torment and punish them for being nonviolent.\n“Even in the midst of vicious, systematic and coordinated attacks or violence against them by the Jihadist Herdsmen, the Government does little or nothing to protect and secure them other than to criminalize and collectively frame them up with all manners of false labelling and accusations.’’\nTackles FG on Igboho, Kanu\nBesides, the group said: “The Department of State Services (DSS), which is the secret police of the Nigerian government, raided the house and killed two domestic staff of a Yoruba Nation activist, Chief Sunday Adeyemo, popularly known as Sunday Igboho. The activist, Chief Igboho, was protesting the incessant killings by herdsmen in Yoruba land.\nIt also accused the Federal Government of “conspiring with Kenyan officials to carry out the kidnap, torture extraordinary rendition and continued detention of the leader of IPOB, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, the leader of IPOB who has waged an effective resistance against jihadists.”\n“The current Nigerian Government is executing a Global Jihadist agenda that is comparable, if not more insidious than that of the Taliban’s of Afghanistan. It is even more dangerous because it is mixed with genocidal tendencies. It is in the best interest of the United States and all the democratic countries of the world to identify this threat early and address it now. This is to prevent the further spread of the global jihadist agenda of the Buhari government and to arrest an imminent ethnic and religious genocide.”\n“We, therefore, urge that the United States Secretary of State, designate the Nigerian Government and the listed State Actors as State sponsors of terrorism to kick start the statutory process and legal instruments of holding them accountable for their high crimes of sponsoring international terrorism.\nYou may kindly note that at the expiration of the two months’ notice, GATE, shall proceed with applying for a writ of mandamus to enjoin the United States Secretary of State to issue the designation”, it stated.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"https://www.vanguardngr.com/2021/11/gate-petitions-us-over-alleged-state-sponsored-terrorism-in-nigeria-tackles-fg-on-igboho-nnamdi-kanu","2":"1726","3":"Travel","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999580383"},{"0":"Johnson Igwedibia, aka Don Waney\nHundreds of Don Wanney’s fighters, who had earlier rejected all government’s overtures to them to surrender their arms have finally done so.\nThey surrendered their arms including explosives, rocket launchers and high-calibre rifles such as AK-47, at Heroes Square yesterday.\nBefore the event, Governor Rochas Okorocha had earlier told journalists, who met with him at the Government House, that he had been busy with several phone calls about the success story that the followers of Don Waney had agreed to handover their arms, describing the development as a healthy one since it is believed that it would ensure lasting peace in the oil-producing areas of the state.\nThe governor remarked that “it is very shocking to note that most of the activists of the Avengers and those of Don Wanney operatives are our sons and daughters from the militancy business and their surrendering arms will end the security challenges we have in the Ohaji/Egbema, Awara and the rest of the areas where people have been on self-exile for many years”.\nHe said “Today we are welcoming back our brothers and sisters who have remained in the creeks and forest for so many years perpetuating all kinds of evil, killing and maiming human beings.\n“But today, glory to God, these our children have decided on their own to come back to the society and be part of the society.\n“They are doing so on their own, surrendering arms which they have used in committing criminal activities for what they called expression of grievances of different sorts.\n“We, as a government, are happy particularly that these young boys and girls will now come back as good citizens of Imo State.

People have also been calling us to confirm if the exchange rate is true. We don’t operate on computer or internet. As at this evening, the value of one US dollar to a naira at black market was N360. If you know where they sell less, please take me there. Its election eve, anything is possible’, Musa told TNG correspondent on phone.\nHowever, the Nigerian currency on Friday gained N1 to close at N358 to the dollar at the parallel market in Lagos.\nTNG reports that the naira traded stronger on the eve of elections than Thursday when it closed at N359 to a dollar.\nThe Pound Sterling was sold at N470 and the Euro at N408.\nAt the Bureau De Change (BDC) segment, the naira traded at N360 to the dollar, while the Pound Sterling and the Euro closed at N470 and N408.\nTrading at the investors window saw the naira closing at N361.49 to the dollar as market turnover stood at 292.34 million dollars.\nMeanwhile, the President of the Association of Bureaux De Change Operators of Nigeria (ABCON), Aminu Gwadabe, last week said the naira has in over 18 months remained stable at both the official and parallel markets despite several odds facing it ahead of the 2019 general elections.\nSpeaking recently to financial journalists in Lagos, the ABCON boss commended the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) financial sector reforms and the contributions of the Bureau de Change (BDC) operators to the current exchange rate stability, as against the common practice of currency devaluations and depreciations across the world at election times.\nGwadabe said that the absence of foreign exchange spikes and volatility before and during the 2019 election year is a major achievement by CBN and the Federal Government. He said: “The dexterity of the government policies in ensuring that naira remained stable in an election year is commendable. Election years, as witnessed during the 2015 general elections, are marred by exchange rate volatility and spikes in the market.”\nHe disclosed that financial pundits had in early 2016, speculated that the naira would depreciate to as low as N1000/$. The election period of 2015, he added, witnessed over $100 billion capital flight outside the country. The activities of currency hoarders, speculators and rent seekers reached its peak in 2015.\nHe disclosed that ironically, the trend in the foreign exchange market during this year’s election showed hope for the economy, sustained exchange rate stability, adequate dollar liquidity, increasing foreign capital inflows and most importantly, a unified and convergent exchange rate of BDCs and the parallel market. These feats, he said, are commendable by all standards.\nOn deepening capacity/skills of industry operators, Gwadabe appealed to CBN to issue Letter of Consent to ABCON proposed training institute. This, he added, is going to boost the current ABCON management’s commitment to capacity building for its members to stimulate competence in the sector and make room for better foreign exchange management.\nContinuing, Gwadabe also listed factors that led to the current successes in the foreign exchange market. He said: “First, I want to congratulate the leadership of CBN for a well coordinated, proactive exchange rate management strategies, which include creation of several foreign exchange windows to deepen liquidity and price discovery, restriction of foreign exchange on 42 items that can be produced locally, self-sufficiency in rice production and continuous partnerships between the apex bank and BDCs, all led to the current exchange rate stability enjoyed in the country.”","1":"https://www.thenewsguru.com/news/nigeria-news/article/confusion-dollar-crashes-heavily-naira-google/","2":"962","3":"Business","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999923706"},{"0":"By Rotimi Fasan\nLet us take a few steps back to a section of last week’s column, and please pay attention to the emphasised words: “Here in Nigeria, the beginning of this year should remind us that the present government in Nigeria has less than 18 months to remain in office. Yet many Nigerians have great expectations on what it can still do and are hanging hopes on it for a better governed country.\n“Well, government may have come to the end of its tether. Former president, Olusegun Obasanjo, is always a polarising figure whose messages are almost always entangled with his person with many confusing the message with the messenger.\n“But he may have said it all when he recently advised Nigerians to more or less accept the truth of his own submission that expecting more from the present All Progressives Congress-led government would amount to beating a dead horse.\nThe government appears spent having given all it can to address the problems plaguing Nigeria. There is pretty little left for it to do to bring about a turn-around in the fortunes of the country.”\nWhen I wrote the foregoing words the two televised interviews the President, Muhammadu Buhari, had with Channels Television and the Nigerian Television Authority, NTA, were yet to be broadcast, supposing they had been recorded earlier.\nThe Channels interview, anchored by Seun Okinbaloye and Maupe Ogun-Yusuf, came in the evening of last Wednesday, many hours after the column had been published in the early hours of the day (it had been written three days before publication), while the NTA interview came a day after.\nFor a media-wary president, granting both interviews hours apart must have felt like killing two birds with a stone. It was a way, it seems, of dispensing with a disgusting chore in quick order to concentrate on more comfortable things.\nThe last major interview the President had with the media, if I recall correctly, was in June last year and it was also like this: first with Arise Television and shortly after, NTA. It would look like the NTA interviews were meant to balance and smoothen out the rough edges that could have emerged from the earlier interviews with the independent broadcasters that would be expected to be less scripted.\nTalking points from the last two interviews bear this out. While critical Nigerians have debated the relevance or irrelevance of the president’s responses to the more probing questions of Channels, they have had to discuss the NTA interview in terms of the president’s personal wishes, in other words the interview took a light-hearted approach.\nThus, while Channels wanted the president’s clarification to issues of galloping inflation, unemployment and exchange rate figures that have quadrupled since 2015 when Buhari became president, the NTA was massaging the president with questions on his aspirations after he leaves the presidency and how he would like to be remembered.\nALSO READ: Still in search of the nation Nigeria\nWhile to the Channels question Buhari left the clearly blazed track and made for the bush, uprooting weeds and bulldosing timber, as he resorts to his familiar tune of calls for a return to the farm when many thought the question had nothing to do with agriculture to say nothing of farms.\nTo the NTA, he also walked the familiar terrain: he would return to his beloved farm after serving. Here’s another excerpt from last week’s column: “If Nigerian politicians will permit, Nigerians can yet experience the good times even as we move close to the last year of President Buhari in office and the old man is allowed to return to his Daura farm as he has promised to.”\nSo, there you have it. President Buhari has not only assured us he has given his best but he has also maintained he is eagerly looking forward to life on his farm where his ageing bones can find some rest among his peers who have long since retired. And who can or should deny an old man such a simple wish?\nThose who want to may look at the weakening energy of the president as a metaphor for the staying power of his government, its mental alertness and the energy it has left to function. If things are properly put in perspective, then Nigerians may be better advised to moderate their expectations of the president and pray more for the deliverance of the power profiteers surrounding him, hoping they would take less advantage of him as a secret security memo recently warned.\nBut while waiting for the president to retire to his Daura farm, Nigerians cannot fold their hands and die in silence. Something has to be done about the matter of the crumbling economy, rising inflation, quadrupled unemployment, which at 33.3 per cent, is the second highest in the world.\nThey would have to address the question of insecurity that has never been this bad with people being kidnapped from their homes and entire villages held hostage if not destroyed. The president recognised this in his acknowledgment of the fact that the job was not thrust on him, rather he applied for it.\nHe may be exasperated as his statement that he has served in all possible capacities indicate: governor, minister and now two-term president. It is, indeed, time for him to be freed.\nAs Nigerians could say in a different context: no be only di president kill Jesus, we plenty for dia. Buhari alone didn’t cause our misfortune. Come to think of it, for a man who has served in various capacities in a country where public office is seen as a meal ticket, an opportunity to quick wealth, President Buhari may well be one of our ‘poorest’ presidents ever barring Shehu Shagari and Umar Yar’Adua.\nNot a few local government chairpersons would be richer than him. Which is to say, he could be far richer than he presently is.\nHis vision of farming as the way out of Nigeria’s economic woes is not entirely unfounded and comes from the folkloric wisdom that a well-fed person cannot be poor and once hunger is out of the way, one’s poverty is at an end.\nYet it is a vision, viewed from the perspective of Buhari, that is entirely bucolic and romantic given the complexity of today’s world. Buhari’s idea of farming is frozen in time.\nWhich may be why his farm in Daura does not have the sophistication of the farm holdings of another farmer-president: Olusegun Obasanjo. One may also ask: which farm does the president want Nigerians given access to?\nThe same from which bandits, insurgents, kidnappers and other criminal elements have chased farmers, aggravating our food crisis?\nAnyhow, Nigerians must cut Buhari a slack.

It shows very clearly the violent nature, disposition and character of those individuals that were involved and the presidential candidate that they support.\n“The Katsina show of shame was the first case of violence unleashed on our candidate by supporters of the candidate of the APC, General Buhari, after the signing of the historic Abuja Accord by the presidential candidates of all the parties participating in the election. The purpose of that accord was to discourage violence before, during and after the elections.\n“The laudable intention of the accord has now been irresponsibly violated by a group of miscreants and vandals whose leader has proved to be wholly incapable of keeping them in check and restraining them from indulging in violence. It is worrisome that this kind of violent reaction would manifest when the election has not held and their candidate has not yet lost.”\nBuhari’ll suffer crushing defeat\nSpeaking further, Fani-Kayode said Buhari and his party would suffer very serious defeat next month, adding: “We are taking this opportunity to serve notice today that by the grace of God and the support of the well-meaning Nigerian electorate, General Buhari will suffer a crushing defeat in the hands of our candidate, President Jonathan, at the polls.\n“When we remember the post-election violence of 2011 after this same candidate lost, you must appreciate the reason why we are raising these concerns.\n“Were it not for the gallant efforts of the security personnel, this small group of violent vandals would have harmed the President and caused damage to the vehicles in his convoy.\n“It is pertinent for us to point out the fact that our candidate, our party and our numerous supporters have so far behaved reasonably and responsibly during the course of this campaign and the world can attest to this with the peaceful rally that General Buhari had in Bayelsa State, the home state of our candidate.”\nAPC was never committed to the Abuja accord\nAlso, the national leadership of the PDP in a statement signed by its National Publicity Secretary, Chief Olisa Metuh, while condemning the attack on Jonathan, said the attack was “a clear indication that the APC is not ready to dial back on its rabid desire to attain power through violence despite signing a peace pact a week ago in Abuja.\nHe said the party would “no longer tolerate such acts of violence on any of its members.\n“This brazen attack on the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and our presidential candidate clearly shows that the APC was never committed to the spirit and letters of the Abuja peace accord which they signed in the presence of prominent Nigerians and international personalities.\n“It is unfortunate that while the PDP and other parties are busy ensuring that their members and supporters remain committed to a peaceful electioneering, the APC has been hatching plots to unleash violence on our candidates and members.\n“We invite Nigerians, friends of Nigeria and all lovers of democracy to rise in condemnation of this dangerous phenomenon. These early developments clearly demonstrate that the comments and declarations by the leaders of the APC that Nigeria would be thrown into chaos and bloodshed should it lose the February general elections were real.\n“We commend the maturity and the ever peaceful disposition of President Jonathan and the leaders of the PDP even in the face of this unwarranted attack.”\nAPC condemns attack\nMeanwhile, the All Progressives Congress, APC, has strongly condemned the reported stoning of the campaign convoy of President Jonathan in Katsina State, saying “violence of any kind is totally unacceptable to the party.”\nIn a statement signed yesterday in Lagos by its National Publicity Secretary, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, the party said Jonathan should be free to campaign anywhere in the country without hindrance.\nIt said: “Even though the attack on the President’s convoy took place a day after the provocative death-wish newspaper advertorial that was put out in the name of the President, nothing justifies the stoning of the President’s convoy anywhere in the country.”\nThe party restated its commitment to a continuous enlightenment of its members and supporters to eschew violence before, during and after next month’s general elections, and urged other parties to follow suit.”\n‘’We consider election as a celebration of democracy, not a do-or-die affair. Whether or not one agrees with the campaign message of any party, engaging in violence negates the very essence of democracy and should be condemned by all,” the party said.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"http://www.vanguardngr.com/2015/01/apc-buhari-behind-attack-jonathan-katsina-pdp/","2":"1384","3":"Politics","4":"0","5":"en","6":"0.9997482896"},{"0":"Nigeria’s flagbearer Marya Usman leads the delegation during the opening ceremony of the 2014 Commonwealth Games at Celtic Park in Glasgow on July 23, 2014.

This is not what you find in other climes.\nAs you walk along tube stations in London, adore billboards on the streets of New York and Toronto, or take a pleasure trip round Johannesburg, or Durban in nearby South Africa, you can’t miss the captivation of film posters which rival most product advertisements. Whereas in Nigeria, posters of church revivals, bearing photos of the pastor and his Mummy Mission-wife compete with the popular MTN slogan of ‘Everywhere You Go’.\nVono Andile, my South African friend who had imagined that Nigeria is such an unrivalled football loving nation came visiting last year, but found it amazing that there are more church posters than advertisement of local football leagues.\nWe joked and laughed.\nThe question that comes to my mind is, how do we see the future of African cinema, when apart from that ‘lousy’ comparison between film and church advertisement, there are more Hollywood posters in our re-emerging cinemas than Nollywood’s?\nThe other aspect is that although the analogy of the church posters may sound heretical, it is illogical in my Public Relations’ media point of view for a charity or non-commercial and untaxed organisation, under which the church falls to rival a commercial organisation like Nollywood in advertisement.\nOf course, the churches are not to blame, for how else do you promote the work of the Lord effectively without the modern techniques of evangelism that also have more TV channels dedicated to ‘deliverance’ dramas than all the Africa Magic and Mzanzi Magic channels put together.\nThe present government, in its readjustment of priorities, must begin to identify potentially viable non-oil sectors of the economy and give them some feathers to fly. This is talking about enabling environment that not only reduces the cost of film production, but also walking the talk of piracy minimisation.\nCottage and community cinemas should be encouraged to change the cinema-going culture from the elitist recreation that some Nigerian cinemas have made it.\nWith these in place, it can only be a win-win for the Nigerian motion picture industry and the Nigerian government, as filmmakers will not only be able to repay loans conveniently, there will be more employment and basis for government to tax the filmmakers and jump start the country’s GDP.\nArt and entertainment must continue to hit our psyche as real businesses and not the ‘play’ thing for which it has been carelessly underrated like other sectors of the economy, as against the almighty oil.","1":"http://thenationonlineng.net/should-we-close-churches-to-reopen-cinemas/","2":"661","3":"Religion","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999904633"},{"0":"Former National Security Adviser

the convener of #RevolutionNow protests, Mr Omoyele Sowore.\nIn a statement personally signed by him, Malami explained that the decision to release the two men was in compliance with the bail granted to them by the court.\nA Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN) and lawyer to the former NSA, Ahmed Raji, confirmed the release of his client.\nHe thanked the AGF for ordering the DSS to comply with the various court orders granting bail to Dasuki.\nDasuki was arrested in December 2015 over an allegation of diverting $2.1billion arms funds while serving as the National Security Adviser during the administration of former President Goodluck Jonathan.\nHe was arraigned in court and was granted bail with certain conditions, but the Federal Government refused to release him in disobedience to the court order.\nOn July 14, 2019, the Court of Appeal in Abuja declared the continued detention of the former NSA since December 29, 2015, by the DSS as illegal, unlawful, and unconstitutional.\nThe appellate court held that the DSS and its Director-General acted outside their constitutional powers on the long period of the detention of a Nigerian citizen and imposed a fine of N5 million on them to be paid to Dasuki as compensation for breach of his fundamental right.\nFour months later and in view of his continued detention, the Court of Appeal varied the terms attached to the bail earlier granted the former NSA.\nIt expunged the requirement that Dasuki should produce a Level 16 civil servant who must own a property worth N100million within the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) as surety.\nRather, the court ordered that the former NSA produce two sureties with property worth N100 million within the FCT.","1":"https://www.channelstv.com/2019/12/24/breaking-sambo-dasuki-released-after-over-four-years-in-detention/","2":"455","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999504089"},{"0":"EFCC grills

financial crimes against Emefiele, a highly placed source said yesterday.\nThere were fears that if the DSS continues with the investigation, the ex-CBN governor might win in court on technical grounds.\nThe source said only the EFCC can put Emefiele on trial, not the DSS, based on the findings made so far.\nEmefiele was transferred (technically released) to EFCC on Thursday afternoon to allow for in-depth investigation and trial.\nThe swap was kept under wraps in order to avoid what the source described as a “distraction.”\nHaving appraised the allegations against Emefiele and the interim report on the ongoing probe of the CBN, the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Mr. Lateef Fagbemi (SAN) sent an advisory to the President that the EFCC is the right agency to probe Emefiele, it was learnt.\n“As a man of due process, the President approved the advisory of the AGF. It was on this basis that the DSS handed over Emefiele to the EFCC on Thursday,” The Nation learnt yesterday.\nAbout two to three weeks ago, the Special Investigator on CBN activities, Jim Obazee, submitted an interim report to the President with a lot of findings requiring in-depth investigation. This was another reason the AGF was very strong in his opinion that the EFCC should manage the ongoing probe.\n“The truth is that such an investigation is not within the mandate of the DSS. Or else, if Emefiele is put on trial by the DSS, he will win on technical grounds,” the highly placed source said.\nAt press time, it was confirmed that a panel of EFCC operatives had started grilling Emefiele on the allegations against him, including the following:\n•Alleged foreign debts of $15 billion\n•Spending of N74. 84 billion on Naira redesign, production and roll out of currencies\n•Alleged fraud in Anchor Borrowers Scheme\n•Suspicious audit of CBN accounts\n•Acquisition of bank, Fintech licences by some top officials of CBN\n•Award of suspicious billions of Naira contracts\nAnother source in EFCC added: “Emefiele is in our custody and he is already responding to issues or allegations raised for him from a team under the supervision of the Director of Operation, Abdulkarim Chukkol.\n“As a commission, we won’t talk on his case in order not to compromise ongoing investigation.”\nThe Head of Media and Publicity of EFCC, Mr. Dele Oyewale, was yet to pick his call at press time.","1":"https://thenationonlineng.net/efcc-grills-emefiele-over-alleged-15b-foreign-debts-new-currency/","2":"858","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999446869"},{"0":"Three persons were Saturday, killed in the botched National Assembly elections in the Ekeremor council area of Bayelsa State.\nThough there were conflicting accounts of the incident, which led to the death of the youths, sources told Vanguard that the incident occurred at about 11.30am along the Ekeremor waterways when some armed youths allegedly laying ambush for election materials engaged men of the Joint Task Force in a shoot out.\nAccording to sources, the violent clash between the armed youths and the JTF occurred close to the waterside of the Ekeremor town.\nIt was gathered that the refusal of the youths to heed the order of the JTF to vacate the waterways triggered the violent shoot out.\nThe youths, according to sources, opened fire on the Joint Task Force Gunboat prompting the security forces to respond fire for fire and the resultant deaths.\nWhile the Ekeremor council chairman, Eddy Julius confirmed the incident and said three persons died, the Coordinator of the Joint Media Centre of the JTF, Lt.

Is it Biafra or restructuring or a Nigerian president of Igbo stock? This question has become pertinent in the face of a majority tribe in Nigeria becoming a minority. There is a strange statistics that the Igbo are the list registered amongst the ethnic groups in Nigeria and this assumption is being used in many quarters against the people. This assumption is being used to shortchange the people politically and many a political party would not field a presidential candidate or the vice –presidential to the south east.\nPersonally, I don’t care where the political parties zoned their candidates to as long as we have good governance in Nigeria and problems of infrastructure in the south east are addressed.\nBut are Igbo minority? The answer is no. If anything, they are the majority tribe in Nigeria. It is only the Igbo that you will see living in large numbers anywhere else in Nigeria. Despite being butchered and hated by many, the Igbo man has remained resolute and committed in what he believes in. Despite being oppressed and intimidated, the Igbo have a dream and have remained committed to that dream. Despite being hated by fellow Igbo, the Igbo man has remained unshakeable in what he believes. The last opinion is a fact. Sometimes, the Igbo is so complicated that it becomes known amongst the others that to deal with an Igbo man, it is a fellow Igbo man that will help and it has been working for them.\nBut does that make Igbo a minority tribe in Nigeria or the least registered? The answer is no and I will explain.\nMore than 50% of the Igbos lives outside that southeast, scattered in the north, west, midde belt, south south and outside the shores of Nigeria.\nIf anything, statistics has shown that Igbo is the largest ethnic group in Nigeria. The South East consists of 99.9% resident Igbo while Igbo have a huge population in other regions. To be fair, at-least Igbo consist 30% to 35% of Lagos populations and Igbo also have big population in South South and Northern States.\nAccording to statistics, North Central has 10,586,965 of registered voters and the Igbo are at-least 700,000. The North East has 9,929,015 registered voters out of which Igbo voters are at least 600,000.\nIn the North West, there are 18,293,093 registered voters and the number of registered Igbo voters are at-least 1,000,000 even though 25% of people that registered to vote in North West are from Chad and Niger.\nIn the South South where they have 11,101,093 registered voters : Igbo voters in South South are at-least 3 to 4 million people\nIn the south east with 8,293,093, Igbo voters constitute at-least 8.2 million people while in the South West with 14,626,800, the number of Igbo voters is at-least 5million people.\nCan anyone compare the number of people from other regions living in the south east/south south to those of people from the south east/south south living in other regions? The answer is no. There is no basis for comparison.\nThe problem is that the Igbo have not been able to stick together to decide on what they want and other zones are taking this to advantage. Nobody from other zones has ever sympathized with the Igbo position. Hence, after since 1999, nobody is thinking seriously about the Igbo in a presidential position whereas others who have had it are striving to have it again and again.\nJust the other day, in a reminiscent of Aba women riot of November/December, 1929 in Aba and Calabar Provinces against the policies of the British colonial administrators , the women of Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, protested in Owerri .\nThe Aba women protested the “special task” foisted on the market women having seen it as anti-development and capable of ruining their businesses. They refused to be intimidated and mobilized into the streets to demand that the special task on market women among other things be proscribed.\nThat show of what many pictured as Aba women riot almost happened again in Owerri when the women said to be members of Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, numbering over 2000 conquered fear and protested against government actions on proponents for Biafra republic. Since the existence of IPOB, it is about the most pronounced protest by pro Biafra women.\nA good number of the women came out topless. They wore black attire. They had with them Biafra insignias. There were young girls, mothers and grandmothers. Some are pregnant.\nThey met the strongest force of armed police officers and in the process, they were rounded up and bundled to the Imo police headquarters.\nIPOB had campaigned against registration of voters exercise and discouraged Igbos from partaking in the exercise which many especially hundreds of thousands of IPOB members obeyed. The Ohanaeze Ndigbo and some groups in the south east have been talking about restructuring while many others are talking about a different thing altogether.\nWhat do the Igbo want? Is it a Nigerian president from the south east? Is it restructuring or Biafra republic?\nDiscordant tunes emanating from the south east require that the people go back to the drawing table and articulate a position on what they want in the Nigerian federation.\nThe way things are, the Nigerian federation has moved on and left the Igbos behind. Currently, this majority tribe is neither here nor there.\nIl flotte dans l’air (It is floating in the air)\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"https://www.vanguardngr.com/2018/09/revisiting-the-igbo-question/","2":"1223","3":"Politics","4":"2","5":"en","6":"0.9999923706"},{"0":"IN a country of more than 42 Ministers, and more similarly ranked government officials, you would be forgiven if you have not heard about Mr. Samuel Ortom. He is the Minister of State for Trade and Investment.\nMr. Ortom announced himself with the threat that the Federal Government was considering sanctions for government agencies and parastatals that bought imported vehicles rather than the ones assembled in the country. As one whose brief included promoting investment, he probably was saying the right words.\nWords are important to government. In fact, they are everything. Mr. Ortom on a visit to a motor manufacturing company in Kano was surprised the company manufactured so many vehicles. He wondered why government agencies bought vehicles made abroad. The threat to sanction government organisations that bought imported cars was the Minister’s proposed solution to the matter. He knows it would not happen.\nFor purposes of headlines and media attention, on which the fulcrum of major government decisions rest, he scored the bull’s eye. Mr. Ortom did not arrive at the event in a Nigerian made car. He knows that the capacity of the assembling plants in Nigeria cannot meet the demands of government. He also knows why they cannot.\nHis bosses do not use cars assembled in Nigeria. They think too that is below their office to use vehicles assembled in Nigeria. They can give reasons they will not touch those cars. In 2009, Nigeria spent N175 billion on imported cars according to the National Automotive Council of Nigeria, NACA.\nMr. Ortom, we would assume, knows that manufacturers have had issues for decades with government. The most telling of these is poor electricity supply which, among other factors, results in goods made in Nigeria not being competitive. How many years have we talked about electricity?\nThree years ago, then Vice President Goodluck Jonathan visited the foremost motor assembling plant in Kaduna. He promised (words again) that by the end of 2009, electricity would be so cheap and its supply so regular that the plant would not require to generate its own electricity. The company had complained that electricity was its major cost and that its unavailability was affecting its capacities.\nElectricity supply has since degenerated. The only improvements are on celebrated increased generation while the company entrusted with supplying it lacks the capacity to do so.\nWhat is the point in wasting resources to generate electricity that we cannot distribute?\n“We have met with the stakeholders in the auto industry and they have come up with a position paper which we are looking into. Our problem is lack of discipline.\nThis time we shall apply sanction for those who go against Federal Government’s policy on patronage for locally assembled vehicles,” Mr. Ortom said. We think there have been too many stakeholders meetings, barely producing results because government’s interests lie in other things.\n“Nigerians have no choice than to patronise their auto assembly plant because they have the potentials to create new jobs and if we patronise our own industries, we will recycle our wealth to the benefit of all,” the Minister said in the same magisterial manner that discards the interests of Nigerians who will buy cheaper products, with the meagre resources that the mismanagement of the economy awards them.\nWords are no longer enough to address issues. When will government provide electricity? When will it have an industrialisation and investment policy that speaks volumes in action?\nMr. Ortom should walk on those already ignored paths.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"http://www.vanguardngr.com/2013/02/how-to-avoid-nigerias-breakaway-in-2015-ibb/Words","2":"727","3":"Politics","4":"2","5":"en","6":"0.999994278"},{"0":"Teachers under the aegis of Basic Education Staff (BES) in Kogi State have appealed to President Muhammadu Buhari to intervene in their present predicament over unpaid salaries and allowance by the State government.\nThe teachers made the appeal while protesting what they described as maltreatment of the highest order which has culminated in both physical, mental and emotional trauma, occasioned by their aggravating condition of service in Lokoja, the capital of Kogi State.\nThe protesting teachers gathered at the Holy Trinity Primary School in their numbers, carrying placards with different inscriptions in their hand to press home there demand.\nIt is also recorded that this is not the first time that the protesting teachers are protesting unpaid salaries, as they were prevented from meeting with the Governor.\nAddressing reporters, the Chairman of the BES in Kogi State, Comrade Ohino Baiye, pointed out some alleged atrocities the board had committed to divert their allowances and also underpay them.\nComrade Baiye said they were more resolute in the struggle for emancipation and to oppose and resist the payment of salaries by the State Universal Basic Education Board (SUBEB) due to the trauma they have experienced in the hands of the present board.\nHe stated that payment should be handed over to Local Government Education Authorities for accountability.\nComrade Baiye also said that their association became necessary because the Nigeria Union of Teachers (NUT) was no longer fighting their cause, but was rather using them to trade.\nOn his part, the SUBEB Chairman said the board had paid salaries to Basic Education teachers in the state, with the fund available to them.","1":"http://www.channelstv.com/2015/08/16/kogi-teachers-protest-unpaid-salaries/?utm_source=&utm_medium=twitter","2":"335","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999027252"},{"0":"Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu on Thursday revealed that the state will borrow N350 billion to fund the 2023 budget.\nThe governor presented had presented a budget of N1.69 trillion to the State House of Assembly for approval for the 2023 fiscal year.\nThe budget is deficit and to be financed by borrowing, which is pegged at N350 billion.\nCurrently, Lagos’ domestic debt as at June 2022, according to the Debt Management Office (DMO) stands at N797,305,312,602.53, while the foreign debt stands at 1.27 billion US Dollars (N555.828bn).\nThis pegged the state’s total debt profile in the region of N1.35 trillion.\nHowever, in presenting the 2023 budget tagged: ‘Budget of Continuity,’ the governor said it comprised a Total Revenue of N1,342,670,649,640 and Deficit Financing of N350,000,000,000.\nThe budget comprises total Internally Generated Revenue (IGR) of N1,108,435,649,640 and Total Federal Transfer of N234,235,000,000.\nSanwo-Olu added that the budget has a recurrent expenditure of N759,958,569,792, comprising Total Overhead Cost of N403,653,328,479; Total Personnel Cost, N247,295,312,088 and Recurrent Debt Service, N109,009,929,224.\nThe N403,653,328,479 Total Overhead Cost is broken down into Overhead, N221,957,283,661; Subvention, N93,501,258,220 and Dedicated, N88,194,786,596.\nThe 2023 budget has a Capital Expenditure of N932,712,190,102, comprising capital expenditure, N670,134,079,150 and Repayment, N262,578,110,952.\n“The budget size is made up of recurrent expenditure of N759,958,569,792 (45%) and capital\nexpenditure of N932,712,190,102 (55%).The deficit financing shall consist of external and internal loans and bonds which are well within our fiscal sustainability parameters,” Sanwo-Olu said.\nIn the sectoral breakdown, Economic Affairs has the highest budget of N339,482,825,430 which represents 20.06 percent of the budget, while General Public Service came second with N308,363,331,313, representing 18.22 percent of the budget.

This is somebody who has been governor of Edo State for almost seven years now.\n“In his last days in office and because he is an APC governor, he is borrowing $75 million to do what he could not do ever since and he is putting the blame on the PDP!\n“First of all, how did he come to power? He came to power through PDP. Both in his first and second tenures, he came to power through PDP; it was the PDP votes that brought him to power. But today, he is biting the finger that fed him! And he is putting his blame on the PDP.”\nEven as the PDP did not only present candidates in the Edo governorship elections but also contested the polls keenly, Amori insisted that the votes that made Oshiomhole the governor were from PDP members.\nBut he refused to explain why his party did so: “You must know that in politics, a lot of things happen. So, let us not go into that.\nBut I can tell you that Oshiomhole was friendlier to the people then. You remember that in Imo State in the last election, PDP members worked against their own candidate to install Ohakim.

Malala on July 14 urged Jonathan to meet with parents of the schoolgirls kidnapped three months ago by Boko Haram. Malala, who survived a Taliban assassination attempt in 2012 and has become a champion for access to schooling, was in Abuja on her 17th birthday to mark the somber anniversary of Boko Haram’s April 14 abduction of 276 girls from a secondary school in the northeast Nigerian city of Chibok. AFP PHOTO\nThe All Progressives Congress (APC) has described as a compound embarrassment the fact that it took 17-year-old girl-child education campaigner, Pakistani Malala Yousafzai, to visit and convince President Goodluck Jonathan to agree to a meeting with representatives of the parents of the kidnapped school girls.\n”President Jonathan, who has already embarrassed himself and the entire people of Nigeria by his inexplicable failure to visit Chibok since the girls were abducted over 90 days ago, has compounded the embarrassment and insulted Nigerians by waiting for Malala to goad him to meet with the girls’ parents, not in Chibok but in Abuja,” the party said in a statement in Lagos, Thursday, by its National Publicity Secretary, Alhaji Lai Mohammed.\nIt said after the meeting failed, because the parents were not properly informed and invited, a shameless presidency turned around to blame the opposition and the patriotic and selfless Nigerians who have been campaigning daily, under the #Bringbackourgirls group.\n”Fortunately, and to the eternal discomfiture of the presidency, the Chibok community has said the decision not to meet with President Jonathan in Abuja was theirs and theirs alone, and that they took that decision because their sole reason for coming to Abuja was to meet with Malala, and not the President who did not invite them anyway.\n”With this explanation, one would have expected a presidency that has regard for the truth to immediately retract its earlier panic statement, which it issued to save face after what was nothing but a PR gimmick blew up in their face, and apologize to the opposition and the #Bringbackourgirls group that were unjustly pilloried by them.\n”Instead, the presidency has persisted in its distortion of the truth, for which they have now become infamous, even as a new date has been agreed for the meeting. This is unfortunate, condemnable and irresponsible,” APC said. ”If indeed, as the presidency claimed earlier, that the opposition was behind the earlier refusal by the parents and escaped girls not to see the President, what has then happened to make them change their minds? Has the opposition now asked them to meet with the President?”\nThe party alerted Nigerians that the reason President Jonathan, whose wife bullied and harangued the girls’ parents on the grounds that they were lying and that no girl was missing, agreed to meet with the parents is so that he could use the meeting as a photo-op, after Malala pushed for it and the President’s US-based image laundering firm acceded to it.\n”Mr. President, your frantic effort to meet with the Chibok parents now is too little too late, and no amount of photo-op will change that. If your handlers had been sincere, Mr. President, they would have told you that the best venue of the meeting is Chibok, not Abuja where your people tried, but failed, to waylay the parents who came for a meeting with Malala.\n”Mr. President, you have ceaselessly compared yourself to the great leaders of our time, including US President Barack Obama. But do you think Obama would have refused to visit the parents of these abducted school girls if the abduction had occurred in the US? Do you think Obama, as Commander-in-Chief, would have refused to visit his troops in the front line of the anti-terror fight as you have done?\n”Do you think, Mr. President, that a band of rogue elements like Boko Haram would have restricted Obama’s movement within his own country as they have done to you? No true and caring President will ever fail to visit the sites of disasters and offer solace to his compatriots,” it said.\nAPC reminded President Jonathan that neither in Nigeria’s culture nor in any other culture are those hit by tragedy invited to be offered solace, adding that the practice is to visit those to be offered solace ‘in situ’.\nThe party reiterated its earlier call on the President to shake off his lethargy and bring the abducted school girls home safely, instead of playing politics with the lives of over 200 human beings.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"http://www.vanguardngr.com/2014/07/meeting-chibok-parents-jonathan-embarrassed-nigeria-apc/#sthash.M5PowVZz.dpuf","2":"1020","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999771118"},{"0":"JOF Nigeria Limited, the organizers of the U-13 JOF Kids Cup said the winner of this year’s edition will go home with the sum of N300, 000 as the cash prize alongside a giant trophy.\nThe Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of JOF Nigeria Limited, the sponsor of the tournament, Dr. Olusegun Olugboyegun, stated this in a press conference on Tuesday.\nThe CEO, who was represented at the press conference by the company’s Director of Strategic Support Services, Adeyinka Adetunji, said the runners-up would get N200, 000 while the third-placed team will smile home with N150, 000.

To defend this claim they will cite a list of criteria that define a ‘good scientific theory’. A common criterion is that the bulk of modern day practising scientists must accept it as valid science. Another criterion defining science is the ability of a theory to make predictions that can be tested. Evolutionists commonly claim that evolution makes many predictions that have been found to be correct. They will cite something like antibiotic resistance in bacteria as some sort of ‘prediction’ of evolution, whereas they question the value of the creationist model in making predictions. Since, they say, creation fails their definition of ‘science’, it is therefore ‘religion’, and (by implication) it can simply be ignored.\nWhat is science?\nMany attempts to define ‘science’ are circular. The point that a theory must be acceptable to contemporary scientists to be acceptable, basically defines science as ‘what scientists do’! In fact, under this definition, economic theories would be acceptable scientific theories, if ‘contemporary scientists’ accepted them as such.\nIn many cases, these so-called definitions of science are blatantly self-serving and contradictory. A number of evolutionary propagandists have claimed that creation is not scientific because it is supposedly untestable. But in the same paragraph they will claim, ‘scientists have carefully examined the claims of creation science, and found that ideas such as the young Earth and global Flood are incompatible with the evidence’. But obviously creation cannot have been examined (tested) and found to be false if it’s ‘untestable’!\nThe definition of ‘science’ has haunted philosophers of science in the 20th century. The approach of Bacon, who is considered the founder of the scientific method, was pretty straightforward:\nobservation → induction → hypothesis → test hypothesis by experiment → proof/disproof → knowledge.\nOf course this, and the whole approach to modern science, depends on two major assumptions: causality1 and induction.2 The philosopher Hume made it clear that these are believed by ‘blind faith’ (Bertrand Russell’s words). Kant and Whitehead claimed to have solved the problem, but Russell recognized that Hume was right. Actually, these assumptions arose from faith in the Creator-God of the Bible, as historians of science like Loren Eiseley have recognized. Many scientists are so philosophically and theologically ignorant that they don’t even realize that they have these (and other) metaphysical assumptions. Being like a frog in the warming water, many do not even notice that there are philosophical assumptions at the root of much that passes as ‘science’. It’s part of their own worldview, so they don’t even notice. We at CMI are ‘up front’ about our acceptance of revelation (the Bible). Unlike many atheists, we recognize that a philosophy of life does not come from the data, but rather the philosophy is brought to the data and used in interpreting it.\nPerceptions and bias\nThe important question is not, ‘Is it science?’ One can just define ‘science’ to exclude everything that one doesn’t like, as many evolutionists do today. Today, science is equated with naturalism: only materialistic notions can be entertained, no matter what the evidence. The prominent evolutionist Professor Richard Lewontin said (emphases in original):\n“We take the side of science in spite of the patent absurdity of some of its constructs, in spite of its failure to fulfil many of its extravagant promises of health and life, in spite of the tolerance of the scientific community for unsubstantiated just-so stories, because we have a prior commitment, a commitment to materialism. It is not that the methods and institutions of science somehow compel us to accept a material explanation of the phenomenal world, but, on the contrary, that we are forced by our a priori adherence to material causes to create an apparatus of investigation and a set of concepts that produce material explanations, no matter how counter-intuitive, no matter how mystifying to the uninitiated. Moreover, that materialism is absolute, for we cannot allow a Divine Foot in the door.”3\nNow that’s open-minded isn’t it? Isn’t ‘science’ about following the evidence wherever it may lead? This is where the religion (in the broadest sense) of the scientist puts the blinkers on. Our individual worldviews bias our perceptions. The atheist paleontologist, Stephen Jay Gould, made the following candid observation:\n“Our ways of learning about the world are strongly influenced by the social preconceptions and biased modes of thinking that each scientist must apply to any problem. The stereotype of a fully rational and objective ‘scientific method’, with individual scientists as logical (and interchangeable) robots is self-serving mythology.”4\nSo the fundamentally important question is, ‘which worldview (bias) is correct?’, because this will likely determine what conclusions are permitted to be drawn from the data. For example, if looking at the origin of life, a materialist will tend to do everything possible to avoid the conclusion that life must have been supernaturally created.\nScience a creationist invention\nOf course the founders of modern science were not materialists (Sir Isaac Newton, widely considered the greatest scientist ever, is a prime example) and they did not see their science as somehow excluding a creator, or even making the Creator redundant (see The biblical roots of modern science: A Christian world view, and in particular a plain understanding of Scripture and Adam’s Fall, was essential for the rise of modern science.). This recent notion, that science = philosophical materialism, has been smuggled into science by atheists.\nMichael Ruse, the Canadian philosopher of science also made the strong point that the issue is not whether evolution is science and creation is religion, because such a distinction is not really valid. The issue is one of ‘coherency of truth’. See The religious nature of evolution.\nIn other words, there is no logically valid way that the materialist can define evolution as ‘science’ and creation as ‘religion’, so that he/she can ignore the issue of creation.\nA valid distinction\nHowever, we can make a valid distinction between different types of science: the distinction between origins science and operational science. Operational science involves discovering how things operate in today’s world—repeatable and observable phenomena in the present. This is the science of Newton, Einstein and Planck, for example. However, origins science deals with the origin of things in the past—unique, unrepeatable, unobservable events. This is why it could also be called ‘historical science’. There is a fundamental difference between how the two work, even though both are called ‘science’, and operational science does have implications for origins (or historical) science. Operational science involves repeatable experimentation in the here and now. Origins science deals with how something came into existence in the past and so is not open to experimental verification / observation (unless someone invents a ‘time machine’ to travel back into the past to observe).5\nOf course it suits many materialists to confuse operational and origins science, although I’m sure with most the confusion arises out of ignorance. Tertiary (college / university) courses in science mostly don’t teach the philosophy of science and rarely make any distinction between experimental / operational and historical / origins sciences.\nBoth evolution and creation fall into the category of origins science. Both are driven by philosophical considerations. The same data (observations in the present) are available to everyone, but different interpretations (stories) are devised to explain what happened in the past.\nNote that this distinction between operational science and evolution is not an invention of creationists. High-profile evolutionists such as Ernst Mayr and E.O. Wilson both acknowledged the distinction.\nThe inclusion of historical science, without distinction, as ‘science’, has undoubtedly contributed to the modern confusion over defining science. This also explains the statement by Gould (above), who, as a paleontologist, would have liked there to have been no distinction between his own historical science and experimental science. Gould rightly saw the paramount importance of presuppositions in his own science and assumed that it applied equally to all science. This is not so. Although some presuppositions play an important role in operational science, historical science depends much more strongly on philosophical assumptions.6\nDo you believe in hot water?\nCreationists have absolutely no problem with operational science, because the evidence drives operational science. It does not matter if you are a Christian, a Moslem, a Hindu, or an Atheist, pure water still boils at 100 °C at sea level. However, the true Hindu might still think it is all an illusion, and some atheists embracing postmodernism espouse that ‘truth’ is an illusion. However, origins science is driven by philosophy. One’s belief system is fundamental to what stories one accepts as plausible. Now if the majority of practitioners of origins / historical science have the wrong belief system (materialism), then the stories they find acceptable will also be wrong. So a majority vote of ‘contemporary scientists’ is hardly a good way to determine the validity of the respective stories. And origins science, or historical science, is essentially an exercise in story-telling—Lewontin alluded to this story-telling in the quote above. James Conant, past President of Harvard University, made the point quite forcibly, with a scathing assessment of the inventive scenarios that often characterise historical science. See also Naturalism.\nThe evidence matters\nNow in pointing out that presuppositions drive what stories are acceptable in historical science, I am not saying that it is merely or solely a matter of those philosophical/religious assumptions. The stories still have to account for the evidence in a coherent manner. That is, the stories provided can often be tested according to the evidence. For example, the claim that coal-bearing geological strata were laid down over many millions of years is flatly contradicted by the evidence of polystrate tree fossils, with their roots broken off, traversing those strata (how did they stand there for millions of years while the layers of deposits built up around them, and all without rotting away?). There are many facts that contradict the evolutionary story: here are 101 evidences that speak against the billions of years of age claimed for the earth: Age of the earth. There are also many counts against the story of biological evolution; see 15 Questions for evolutionists.\nIf the same data could be consistently interpreted in two entirely different ways, then Romans 1 would have no basis for saying that people have no excuse for denying that things were created by God because it is clear from the physical evidence.\nWe can speak of a ‘coherency of truth’ as a test; that a truthful account of history will give a coherent (logically consistent) account of the evidence.\nDefine terms consistently!\nIt also suits materialists to shift the definition of evolution to suit the argument. Let’s be clear that we are discussing the ‘General Theory of Evolution’ (GTE), which was defined by the evolutionist Kerkut as ‘the theory that all the living forms in the world have arisen from a single source which itself came from an inorganic form’.7 Many, perhaps inadvertently, perform this switching definitions trick in alluding to mutations in bacteria as corroborating ‘evolution’. This has nothing to do with demonstrating the validity of the belief that hydrogen changed into humans over billions of years. The key difference is that the GTE requires not just change, but change that substantially increases the information content of the biosphere. See also this discussion of definitions.\nPredictions or ‘postdictions’?\nMany evolutionists claim mutations and antibiotic resistance in bacteria (operational science) as being some sort of prediction of evolution (origins science). In fact, genetics (operational science) was an embarrassment to evolution, which could have been a factor in Mendel’s pioneering genetics research going unrecognized for so many years (Mendel’s discovery of discrete genes did not fit Darwin’s idea of continuous unlimited variation). When mutations were discovered, these were seen as a way of reconciling Darwinism with the observations of operational science—hence the ‘neo-Darwinian’ synthesis of Mayr, Haldane, Fisher, etc.\nWhat about the predictions of evolution vs creation? The track record of evolution is pretty dismal. See How evolution harms science. On the other hand, modern science rides on the achievements of past creationists—see How important to science is evolution? and Contributions of creationist scientists. For just one clear example of modern-day predictions based on a creationist model, see Beyond Neptune: Voyager II Supports Creation.\nMany ‘predictions’ of evolutionary theory have been found to be incompatible with observations; and yet evolution reigns. For example, there is the profound absence of the many millions of transitional fossils that should exist if evolution were true (see Are there any Transitional Fossils?). The very pattern in the fossil record flatly contradicts evolutionary notions of what it should be like—see, for example, The links are missing. The evolutionist Gould wrote at length on this conundrum.\nContrary to evolutionists’ expectations, none of the cases of antibiotic resistance, insecticide resistance, etc. that have been studied at a biochemical level (i.e. operational science) have involved de novo origin of new complex genetic information. In fact, evolutionists never predicted antibiotic resistance, because historically it took the medical field by surprise—see Anthrax and antibiotics: Is evolution relevant?\nContrary to evolutionists’ expectations, breeding experiments reach limits; change is not unlimited. See the article by the creationist geneticist, Lane Lester. This matches what we would expect from Genesis 1, where it says that God created organisms to reproduce true to their different kinds.\nAnother failed evolutionary ‘prediction’ is that of ‘junk DNA’. Evolutionists long claimed that 98% of the human DNA is junk, mere leftovers of our supposed evolutionary ancestry. This has hindered the discovery of the function of this DNA, now known to be at least 80% functional, and probably 100% is functional. See Dazzling DNA.\nEvolutionists expected that, given the right conditions, a living cell could make itself (abiogenesis); creationists said this was impossible. Operational science has destroyed this evolutionary notion; so much so that many evolutionists now want to leave the origin of life out of the debate. Many propagandists claim that evolution does not include this, although the theories of abiogenesis are usually called ‘chemical evolution’ and normally included within undergraduate courses on evolution.. See Origin of Life for an explanation of the many profound problems for any conceivable evolutionary scenario.\nNote: Claiming fulfilled predictions as proof of a hypothesis is known as the fallacy of affirming the consequent. However, if a prediction is falsified, it amounts to formal disproof of the proposition, so evolution has been formally disproved with multiple failed predictions.\nFalsified but not abandoned\nSo, why do evolutionists persist with their spurious theory? For many it’s because they have never heard anything else. For avowed materialists it’s the ‘only game in town’—the only materialistic story available to explain how everything came to be; the materialist’s creation myth. It’s a bit like the proverbial ostrich putting its head in the sand, thinking that all that exists is what it can see under the sand. The ostrich’s worldview excludes everything that it does not find convenient. In the darkness of the sand, all unacceptable facts cease to exist.\nThe persistence of evolutionary thinking in the face of so much contradictory evidence indicates that the philosophical presupposition of materialism (atheism) trumps the facts. The paradigm has priority, no matter what the evidence, because the secularist ‘cannot allow a divine foot in the door’. For a summary of the failed arguments for evolution, see Arguments evolutionists should not use.\nLight in the darkness!\nJesus Christ came as ‘the light of the world’ (John 8:12), when the Second Person of the Trinity took on human nature (see The Incarnation: Why did God become Man?). He came to shed the light of God in dark places. The greatest darkness is to live without God; to live as if you are a cosmic accident, just ‘rearranged pond scum’, as one evolutionist put it. Sadly, many are being duped into thinking that way, and we are seeing the horrendous consequences in escalating youth suicide, drug problems, family break-up, violence, etc. How much we need the light of Jesus to shine! God will hold each one of us accountable—all of us deserve His condemnation. But the Bible says that He has provided a way of escape through Jesus Christ for all that turn to God, humbly admitting our need of forgiveness.

One of the challenges we have had is the issue of ballot snatching” adding that “you could snatch a ballot box and take it to another unit and it could go back”.\nHe further noted that “what INEC has done is that they tied each ballot box to a particular polling unit, so if you took a ballot box away, the chance of you getting it back to that polling unit is next to nothing and that is why you haven’t seen any issue of ballot box snatching today”.\nHe also noted that about 700, 000 persons were tweaked out of the voter register because they “didn’t do their due process” thereby pruning the number of voters from 2.4 million to 1.7 million.\nAkpedeye further noted that “INEC keeps thinking of better ways of doing things” insisting that “the challenges are still there”.\nHe however berated the late arrival of voting materials to the polling units saying; “I would have thought we would be able to seamlessly deliver voting materials for the voters latest by 9AM”.\nHe noted that the bad state of the roads made traveling from one spot to the other took quite more than normal.\nMoney Exchanging Hands\nAn election observer, Festus Okoye, confirmed that there was an exchange of money between the voters and representatives of the candidates.\nHe however noted that those who collected the money claimed they were getting back their money.\n“The money belongs to us (voters) so we are going to collect it and still vote in accordance with pure conscience,” the voters were quoted as saying..\nOkoye praised the attitude of INEC officials and voters in the polling unit he monitored but maintained that “there are operational and logistics challenges that INEC must overcome”.","1":"http://www.channelstv.com/home/2013/11/16/nba-commends-conduct-of-anambra-election/","2":"458","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999980927"},{"0":"When I started preaching, people wanted to bring me down, says Ooni of Ife’s wife\nThe Ooni of Ife’s wife, Olori Naomi Ogunwusi, has admitted that she has always loved the white garment church, Cherubim & Seraphim.\nSpeaking on Saturday at the Seraphim Media Summit held at Seraph Land, Maba, Ogun State, Olori said she was born and raised up in a Bible-believing church but whenever she preached as a young girl, they said she sounded like a member of C&S.\nShe said, “When I began preaching at a tender age, it was strange to the church I worshipped. They said I preached like the people from C&S. I thank you for bringing me here today because I have always wanted to be identified with the people they say I preach like. I love the church so much and I will always speak for you anywhere.”\nShe advised members to shun negative criticisms, saying that it was a deliberate act by certain people to ridicule what the church stood for.\nShe explained, “I rejoice with the church today because of the foundation. When I wanted to learn about indigenous men of God, the first person that came to my mind was the late founder of the church, Moses Orimolade. I want you to know that you are a beautiful brand regardless of what people say about you. You have a beautiful mark of identification; with your white garment, you don’t need any further introduction to anyone.\n“We all know that in every original product, there are fake ones. People will always try to bring you down. When people said I was preaching like a C&S member, they were trying to bring me down,” she said.\nDelivering her keynote address, the Founder of Love of Christ Generation in London, Rev Mother Esther Ajayi, said the mission of C&S was to renew the image of the church.\nHe said, “This summit is important because we live in a world that is changing. We are called all sorts of names by people. Even people who come to us for help tarnish us in the daylight. But like other denominations, we all have our shortcomings and humans will always be humans.”\nREAD ALSO: Ooni’s ex-wife congratulates him, new queen\nShe also said the founder of the church was never a cultist, maintaining that C&S is the only indigenous church that doesn’t have any western influence, “Our late founder was not a cultist but he was feared by cultists. When I met with Pastor Enoch Adeboye recently, he said his late mother was always saying that fetish people feared C&S because they knew they were powerful.\n“I urge the media to be free and fair when reporting C&S like they are with others. Nollywood practitioners should stop using white garment to portray bad characters. Members must also avoid dragging the name of the church through the mud,” Ajayi added.\nMeanwhile, the Supreme Head, Cherubim & Seraphim Unification Church of Nigeria, Dr Prophet Solomon Alao, who appreciated the organisers of the summit said that with all the church has done to provide spiritual and physical supports for humanity, that it was unbelievable many take joy in tagging the church in ungodly names, which negate the essence of the church.\nHe added, “We are pleading with them to fear God. I admit that we have a few bad eggs among us but this is not peculiar to our church alone.”","1":"https://thenationonlineng.net/when-i-started-preaching-people-want-to-bring-me-down-says-ooni-of-ifes-wife/","2":"753","3":"Culture","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9998703003"},{"0":"Biafra: Uwazuruike, MASSOB back Asari-Dokubo\nBy Damian Duruiheoma, Owerri\nFounder of the Movement for the Actualization of Sovereign State of Biafra and Biafra Independent Movement (BIM-MASSOB), Chief Ralph Uwazuruike, has hailed Alhaji Mujahid Asari-Dokubo on his emergence as the leader of the new Biafra De Facto Customary Government.\nAsari-Dokubo, a former militant in the Niger Delta region, had a few days ago, announced himself as the leader of the new Biafra de facto Customary Government, citing “injustice and marginalisation” on the Igbo people found in various zones of the country as the reason for his aspiring for a “better life for his people.”\nIn a statement issued on his behalf by his media assistant, Chris Mocha, Uwazuruike described Asari-Dokubo’s emergence as a clear manifestation of “our monthly concerted efforts at reconciling different pro-Biafran groups towards achieving greater harmony against our common enemy”.\nThe MASSOB leader, who extended his unalloyed support to the new leader of Biafra Customary government, also congratulated Asari-Dokubo for towing the line of non-violence agreement in the crusade for the emancipation struggle of the people of Biafra.\n“Asari-Dokubo is a fearless principal actor in our quest for Biafra actualization mission and has remained ever assertive and vocal and indefatigable.

The whole of the settlement had been bombarded. This settlement has nothing to do with bandits Infact they showed us two wells full of innocent people, dead, inside, casualties of these bombardments.”\nREAD ALSO:It’s hypocritical Buhari signing padded 2022 budget, but rejected Electoral Bill —Wike\n“That’s exactly what these bandits were telling us.They said “whenever we hear the sound of an aircraft, we run to our caves ,and then run.If they will succeed in killing anybody, it is the small children ,the wives or the cows. “\n“That’s their own testimony.So you can imagine a country where,for example, bandits would gather in a forest and be celebrating. You don’t even have intelligence to track them and eliminate them.Then for you to say you will succeed in killing them?”\n“I hear them yesterday., celebrating the reported death of bandit leader.So , for example if you kill one bandit leader and another one emerges,what benefit did you derive?”\n“For example you killed Dogo Gide, a person more dreaded than him.emerged.When they killed Buharin Daji, Turji emerged. So what’s the success there?And for us to even be celebrating. There is nothing to celebrate,the only thing we can celebrate is that if our military succeeds in crushing them all and they cannot.”\nHe said if America could go to Afghanistan and spent 20 years, “spending 3 trillion dollars andvwasting 3600 personnel,over 20000 citizens killed after 20 years,they are coming to dialogue with the Taliban…what do you expect in Nigeria?”\n“These ( Americans) are people that have so much transparency even in their military spending. You will not hear even the cases of corruption like the one we hear in Nigeria. So if they would do that after all these 20 years, what do you expect from Nigeria?”\n“I can tell you without any fear of contradiction, Buhari would spend the next one year 7 months without addressing this issue. And if the next President comes snd he will follow the same process , he cannot succeed.”\n“You have to address so many economic issues and so many issues of injustice. And then for you to pursue the path of dialogue. It is not the sign of weakness. That’s what Yar’Adua initiated in Niger Delta. “\n“Do you think the silence we used to hear now from Niger Delta,is it because of gun? Is it because of military might?There are many top militant commanders that have been on the payroll of the Federal Government for the past 8 years. They are the richest now, top militants, Commanders,” he alleged.\n“But this is a silent issue that nobody knows. But that is the reason why you can explore oil and then.ecploit it.The only reason why their own is different is because the Federal Government knows that if they didn’t do something there,it will affect the whole economy. That’s the issue.”\nSpeaking further, Mamu who said he was also a media consultant to Sheikh Gumi, said the isue of security has no religious barrier as it affected everybody.\n“It is something that is really consuming the society. Our major problem as a nation is how to go about solving this crisis that has defied all solutions,so far.”\n“Alot of people are giving their own perspectives, a lot of people are giving their own thoughts about the way they think it is the appropriate way to manage the whole crisis.”\n“But for Sheikh Gumi,we believe people are making comments out of either naivety or out of ignorance about the quantum of the problems that we have and how to go about it.”\n“I think by now we are authorities especially on issues that have to do with banditry. Genesis of the crisis, how to go about it, and then what we’ve actually seen on the ground. This is because nobody in Nigeria have seen what we saw.”\n“We’ve quite alot of experience to narrate, to say it.One may ask what is even the reason why, for example somebody like Sheikh Gumi would leave the comfort of his own house , sacrifice his own life and visit the forest?:\n“Is it just for the media publicity?So one would imagine ,how would somebody be so stupid, because he wants to be in the headlines to sacrifice his own life, don’t know whether he will be coming back after visiting the bush or not.”\n“So there are certain things that rationally one would find answers to.For the benefit of the audience,Gumi has passed the stage where he will solicit media headlines. That is the truth,first. There is no benefit at all financially,apart from using your own resources,as far as these visits that we used to do.”\nHe said the primary focus and interest was for the “respected and revered religious leader” to play his own part in making sure that the spill of blood, the quantum of innocent blood being wasted everyday, is stopped which Gumi believes is very dangerous for the nation.\n“If the nation allows that to happen or to continue to happen,only God knows the kind of calamity that will happen. This is because what God dislikes is wasting innocent blood especially of those that did not even know what’s happening. Most of the victims of this banditry and issues of insecurity are very innocent people across the religious divide.They don’t even know what is happening, they’re just victims of the society and the failed leadership that we have,” he alleged.\nHe recalled an interview in which a Christian clergy spoke on the activities of Sheikh Gumi, saying “coming back to that particular interview,it’s not the first time you will hear people,for example,saying Gumi is protecting bandits, governments are supporting him,he supposed to be arrested, and all sort of comments.”\n“We used to laugh when people say government is over protecting or having interest , or something like that regarding the activities of Sheikh Gumi.”\n“The reason why I said so, I gave a very clear example. The relationship between the current President and Sheikh Gumi is not a cordial relationship.If it were cordial,the Sheikh wouldn’t spend months trying to see the President and would not be even granted access to see him.This is something they should know.”\n“What I emphasised is that if there is anybody, I want to be on record,if there is anybody,that is looking for anything no matter how small in Gumi to arrest him,that person is President Buhari .I want to say it without any fear of contradiction.”\n“We know what’s happening. The President is aggrieved with the Sheikh because of so many reasons. For that,no matter what the Sheikh initiated,no matter how laudable anything that will come from the Sheikh,the President will not welcome it.”\n“If not we’ve gotten the support of top security officers including the NSA,the DG SSS, Nigerian Police Force, all the top security chiefs,at one time or the other,they had cooperated with what we were doing.”\n“But no matter what you do, you’ve to get the encouragement or the approval from the above for you to even succeed. That is why most of the missions ended in failure despite our sacrifice and determination to reach out to these people.”\n“For the record, I would have wished for the respected pastor will reflect on so many other things. Part of the things he will reflect is ,for example, if you said you will approach…..what the government has done so far related to bombardment which we believe is more of propaganda than reality.”\n“What the government has done so far related to wasting billions of Naira in tax payers money to buy Tucano jets, most of them over inflated projects, contracts that end up enriching few people in the military. What the government has so far succeeded compared to the amount of resources that has so far been spent,is not commensurate at all,” he alleged.\n“It is something really , very questionable that every sensible Nigerian should ask himself…there are very few cliques within the military that are really benefitting from these war against insecurity. That is why anytime you will hear the name of Sheikh Gumi.”\n“Some of them even sponsored write ups in newspaper houses, for example to either condemn the initiative or to discredit it.To give it a different picture that will even create more division, for example between Christians and Muslims. But the Sheikh is telling them, ..how can you even put religion, for example, on issues that have to do with security?” He alleged.\n“If these bandits are attacking or are on rampage,are they targeting Muslims only or both Muslims and Christians?They don’t care who you are.They don’t care whether you are a Muslim or a Christian,what faith you belong to.Most of them that have,in one way or another,became victims, they can tell you how barbaric they are. How criminal they can be.”\n“So, what the Sheikh is saying is that,if for example as a nation,we know that we are honest in our military spending, we know that we are prudent in our military spending,if as a nation we know that most of this money is not diverted to the pockets of few military officers,if we know as a nation we have proper intelligence,to extract information and then ,apprehend these criminals head on,if we know that as a nation, for example we have the capacity to crush these elements once and for all ,so that the nation will live in peace,then go ahead and do it.”\n“But in a country whereby,you are lacking in all these things that I’ve mentioned,then what option do you have as a responsible leader to ensure that you preserve even one single soul?”\n“Is negotiation, is dialogue, is amnesty, not the best option as long as you will protect innocent lives from being killed everyday?From being kidnapped everyday? “\n“So that is what the Sheikh is saying everyday and that’s what alot of critics failed to understand. And what difference does it make , for example now out of media blackmail,…bandits are terrorists today. And then tomorrow, you don’t have any new method that will make sure it ends the terror action..What difference does that make?”\n“So,what we are saying is that,if for example there will be something new,for example the announcement of the prescription of anything that has to do with banditry or terrorism,…we know it is a terror act.But he is afraid, these people have not being indoctrinated like Boko Haram. Because Boko Haram people believe if they die they are going to heaven. So this is a religious war,as far as they are concerned.”\n“These people are fighting economic war because of so many things that happened in the past. Most of them are victim.of cattle rustling,you will find that one Fulani man will have more than 200 cows. He will wake up in a day they’ve been rustled. At the end of the day a Fulani man values his cow more than his religion. “\n“So what option do you have, if for example somebody that is dispossessed of everything he has,then he got AK 47.He doesn’t have Islamic knowledge,no conventional knowledge, a completely ignorant person and you think he cannot be exploited?”\n“So that is why the approach of the Sheikh is that for you to even bring this thing to an end,you must go back to the drawing board. You have to understand the genesis of the crisis. If there’s any issue of injustice that’s been done to these people,you’ve to address this injustice first.”\n“For example if you say you will condemn any idea of educating the Fulani,which as a result of lack of education that they have so much ignorance to even go into this kind of criminality,then what are you encouraging in the next ten to twenty years? More banditry,more kidnapping,anything of that nature will also increase.”\n“But as the Sheikh is saying, when you educate a society,like the Martin Luther Kings are saying,once somebody is educated, I’m telling you no matter how the society cheats him, he will not go into criminality.He will, instead, adopt a very civil means of earning a living.”\n“But living in ignorance,these people even during visits,they used to say since the nation was created,they don’t know anything about Nigerian budget. It has never benefits them.They don’t have water,they don’t have schools ,they don’t have clinics.Anything that you see that government has the responsibility to provide,they don’t even know it exists. They live virtually,the whole of their lives in the forests.”\n“And then ,they are catering for themselves and at the end of the day,their means of livelihood is no longer there. That’s the reason why the insecurity persists.”\n“That’s why we are saying that when for example you don’t put rationality in analysing security issues, honestly there is so much danger. One of the dangers is you will succeed in creating division among the Christians and the Muslims. That’s the area of concern I discussed with my colleagues in the South when I went there.i said if we people did not come together as media men,see the kind of crisis we have and have a common way of reporting,honestly we would end up,the bandits would destroy us,we would destroy ourselves at the same time.”\n“That’s exactly what’s happening now because,for example the tune of reports of the Northern media and the Southern media for example,related to issue of banditry or insecurity,you will see it ,they are coming out along religious line.”\n“Instead of us to confront the whole issue as it is and then find a solution,that will benefit the entire society.”\nWhen asked that during one of their visits to the forests, the Governor of Zamfara welcomes them wholeartedly and the Governor of Sokoto too, bought in.\nBut why was it that the President don’t want to accept their proposal?\nHe alleged that the President was not in touch with basic realities.\n” He is somebody,for example,that relies hundred percent on security reports. As a President you don’t rely hundred percent on security reports. The security reports can be distorted Security reports can be made in a way that can favour certain interests.”\n“You’ve to try certain channels of communication. Channels of getting additional information as a President,especially regarding sensitive issue’s to do with security.”\n“Most of the problems we used to have especially during the former service chiefs, with even these present ones,is that,you know ,most of them,sadly to say,they don’t want this war to end because there’s alot of money inside A lot of billions inside,” he alleged.\n“Infact, apart from top politicians in this country that are really in strategic positions,the richest people in Nigeria today are the military.That is why they are quite.\nSo much money is been diverted in the name of security,our security spending is one of the most corrupt in the history of the whole world.So with this for example ,if a commander or chief executive did not understand this line of politics,I tell you there’s no way we can eliminate or tackle the issue of this kind of banditry,” he alleged.\n“From what the state government and the Federal Government..,there is no way …because a Governor,for example would say I’ve released N2 billion for security vote;at the end of the day he will take half and then, they will also share there own…” He alleged.\n“This is what is happening in most of these states.As an ex military officer,these are some of the things that Gumi understands and that is why he has been consistent in trying to educate even those that didn’t understand for them to understand the politics and then, the reason why a lot of people especially in those position of power and authority would not support these kinds of initiatives. “\nComments expressed here do not

so it is normal to have outstanding balances at certain times.\n“Additionally, through our subsidiary, NNPC Trading, we maintain open trade credit lines with several traders.”\nBut when asked to confirm the exact amount the company owes its PMS suppliers, the spokesperson declined, saying, “I will need some time to provide you with the exact amount”.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"https://www.vanguardngr.com/2024/09/revealed-how-6-billion-nnpc-debt-is-causing-petrol-supply-hiccups/#google_vignetteThe","2":"645","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999752045"},{"0":"By Henry Umoru\nABUJA — NATIONAL leadership of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, has again alleged that the leadership of the All Progressives Congress, APC, was behind the continued cases of insurgency where members of the Boko Haram sect have engaged in massive killings and wanton destruction of property.\nThe PDP, however, boasted that no amount of blackmail and wild allegations against President Goodluck Jonathan can exonerate the APC of blame for insurgency and wave of violence ravaging some northern states of the country.\nIn a statement, yesterday, by PDP National Publicity Secretary, Olisa Metuh, the PDP noted that the memory of Nigerians was not short on the body language and inciting utterances of APC leaders, including their presidential candidate, General Muhammadu Buhari, which had served as fuel to the raging flame of terrorism.\nAccording to the PDP: “By going to the international media recently to distance themselves from complicity and in turning round to blame the PDP, the APC is asking Nigerians to suddenly grow forgetful of the barrage of statements by their leaders that promoted insurgency in the country.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"http://www.vanguardngr.com/2014/12/pdp-accuses-apc-backing-boko-haram/#sthash.p5nyXrEH.dpuf","2":"253","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999027252"},{"0":"By Boluwaji Obahopo\nLOKOJA—A royal father in Kogi State, the Maigari of Lokoja, Muhammed Makarfi II has called on the Federal Government to revisit and implement the 1976 Dasuki Local Government reform, saying it was the only solution to the barrage of problems facing the third tier of government.\nThe tradition ruler, who spoke yesterday while receiving the newly constituted five-man administrative committee for Lokoja Local Government, however said the implementation must be done wholeheartedly or nothing would change.\nAccording to him: “The 1976 Alhaji Ibrahim Dasuki Reform would have saved the local government from all its present challenges.

Lourenço da Silva Mendouça, the First world Abolitionist, was a Prince from the royal family of Ndongo Kingdom in Angola. He had successfully convinced authorities to end slavery in Europe. What Nafafé discovered is that in 1684, Mendonça went to the Vatican, where he accused the nations involved in the trans Atlantic slave trade of crimes against humanity. It was not just a petition, it became court cases, undertaken by Black Africans and supported through highly organized international solidarity.\nWhy the Vatican? It was Pope VI who had issued Papal Bull that authorized Spain and Portugal to colonize and enslave Africa, America and the Natives in 1493 AD. Muhammed Ali was on Mike Douglas Show with Sly of The Family Stone as co-host when he complained about Slavery. One of the guests, Rep. Wayne L. Hays, claimed the African Chiefs were paid. What he did not say is that the slave raiders went back, captured the Chiefs and sold them into the plantations as the other slaves.\nNafafé explained that “It has never been previously established by historians that Mendonça was an African, which is really incredible – that in the 1600s you had this African man who traveled all over Europe to mobilize an activist movement for the liberation not only of Black Africans, but also of Indigenous people in the Americas ... People always think that the legal abolitionist movement started in Britain, in the late 18th century, but Mendonça really forces us to review our positions on this.”\nhttps://www.aljazeera.com/features/2021/3/10/how-portugal-sil enced-centuries-of-violence-and-trauma Well before 300 AD, Africans had been fighting the Muslim Caliphate from Ghana to Songhai Empires. The Zanj fought and conquered the Abbāsid caliphal empire. Their fight for Freedom and Rebellions led to the Zanj superior power in Mesopotamia that ruled Basra in Iraq into Iran from 869 to 883 AD. It took all combined forces of Arab states before Arabs were later able to overcome them.\nBookman, another captured African leader of Maroon and Vodou Houngan, fought for Freedom in Haiti for Independence from France. The wrong notion that freedom for people only exists within the Western Activists is astounding. It is well known in the Diaspora that the Chiefs that sold African slaves were later captured by the same raiders and sold in countries other slaves were. Researchers and genes tracers confirmed many of the slaves in the Americas came from the lines of Kings and Chiefs that sold slaves and were sold into slavery themselves.\nMany African Americans like the Zanj conqueror of Basra, are aware and proud of their royal blood from Africa. Yet some blame new African immigrants not the raided Chiefs, for selling them out; knowing pretty well that their sellers were also captured about the same time after they were. The African Chiefs that sold Africans into the Diaspora suffered the same fate when the slave raiders brought them into the Diaspora. Stop blaming all Africans at home, many rebeled against slave trade sacrificing their lives like Bookman, at home and abroad.\nWhen the African sellers arrived at the plantations, their subjects and fellow African slaves that got there earlier recognized them. Some ridiculed the new arrivals and others welcomed them with hostility. The hostility remained today within African American communities, disrespecting one another and hostile to recent African immigrants. Some African Americans still blame the captured and free Africans that escaped slavery, rebelled and fought against slavery.\nMuhamed Ali was right, when Sly Stone tried to distract him while answering Rep. Wayne Hays questions, he said: Black people spend so much time attacking one another, some of us become a distraction from the real goal of keeping our energy on the Prize. As the inhumanity of man to man became more vicious, free Africans at home rebelled and ran away as those on the slave ships and in the Diaspora. Indeed, France got reverse reparation from Haiti.\nNobel laureate Wole Soyinka was at Cambridge Library Colloquium with Prof. Louis Gate of Harvard University talking about Black on Blacks angers from Nigeria/Ghana to South Africa/other Africans. Prof. Gates raised the issue of recent Africans immigrants. More than forty years after Mohamed Ali and Wayne Hays tangled on the Mike Douglas Show. Prof. Gates, like some African Americans, still thinks the African immigrants that sold them, follow them to America to share their quota. It was embarrassing for all Africans at home and in the Diaspora that the issue is still alive at Harvard of all places.\nQuota is dead in America. It was threatened by American white students in courts, not recent African immigrants. Indeed, the United States Supreme Court finally nailed it. Though replaced by Affirmative Action, that was also replaced by Diversity for all ethnic groups. The diversity is being threatened by Asians in Court suing that they were cheated in Admission to Harvard; not by the African students. No other ethnic group in America attacks their own from old countries. The Irish created special admission for their recent Irish immigrants just as the Italians, Polish, Ukrainians Americans welcome their recent immigrants.\nAfricans must find better ways to reconcile their differences at home and in the Diaspora. Black on Black crimes must decrease below the level of White on White, Asians on Asians or Natives on Native crimes. People victimize their own at a greater proportion than they victimize others. But Africans have suffered in the hands of others more than any other continent. It is true that the Chiefs sold their own for guns and mirrors to capture more slaves, it does not justify liberty of worst mean spirited habits by individuals to lynch, slash and burn slaves for any or no reason.\nIndeed, Yoruba tradition cautions that the way a child was born, so was a slave. Bi a se bi Omo ni a se bi Eru. The cry for reparations must be understood as making amends for past injustices, not to displace or favor anyone. Those that have gained from past injustices against Africans and continue to exploit the people and the Continent must look for humane ways to make their profit and pay Africans reparations appropriately to those that are due. Unlike France that demanded and got reparations from its colonies from Haiti to Africa.\nDespite all the wars Africans fought against the Muslims and Christians coming as explorers and missionaries, sent into the Dark Continent for 500 years, the only miracle is that Africans have not been eliminated from the surface of the Earth. They are strong and resilient. We do not need anymore enemies within. Today we are lured, not forced into slave ships anymore. Most of the new Africans use life savings to buy tickets on Boeing 707 like the looters and their families.\nThe most anguishing part is that Africa, Haiti, and other historically hugely humanly explored parts of the world remain so devoid of prosperity, of tolerance towards minorities, of Justice.","1":"https://www.modernghana.com/news/1183912/slaves-their-seller-chiefs-were-raided-by-arabs.html?_gl=1","2":"1458","3":"Culture","4":"3","5":"en","6":"0.9999752045"},{"0":"Ekiti election –

senatorial districts of the state report that many voters had arrived their polling units as early as 6.30 a.m. to wait for election officials.\nAcross many polling units in Ado Ekiti, the state capital, there was an impressive turnout of enthusiastic voters determined to exercise their civic responsibilities.\nAt ward 10 Unit 12 a&b, Basiri area of Ado-Ekiti, the Assistant Presiding Officer, Miss Nafisat Jamie, told NAN that though they collected all the election materials as early as 6.00 am, the process could not start due to transportation challenge to the unit.\nAs at 8.53 am, the names of eligible voters were just being pasted for viewing and confirmation.\nAn observer from the Transition Monitoring Group, Mrs Tosin Abati, said that the Ekiti election process started late due to late arrival of INEC officials.\nAt Ward 10 Unit 9, Okesha area of the state capital, the Assistant Presiding Officer 2, Mr Owoseni Taiwo, addressed the voters, who were already on the queue and opened the ballot box for everyone to see and confirm that it was empty.\nVisits to Wards 3, Units 5 and 13 Idemo, and Ward 9 Unit 12 Odo-Ado revealed that accreditation and voting were going on simultaneously with security men on standby.\nDr Mike Omilusi, an observer from the Alliance for Credible Election, commended INEC for its pro-active strategies in the Ekiti election in terms of voter education and sensitisation ahead of the poll.\nHe also commended INEC on the use of the card readers for the Ekiti election, but advised that more card readers be made available in future elections.\nThe observer said that the new idea of accreditation and voting simultaneously was commendable, noting that this would ensure quick conclusion of the exercise.\nAt the St Michael’s School, Ajilosun, opposite Mobil filling station, the turnout was also impressive while the accreditation and voting process was also going on simultaneously.\nSpeaking an observer from the Justice Development and Peace Initiative, Mr Aluko Isiaih, said that, the Ekiti election started well until when the card reader in one of the wards stopped working for about 45 minutes before it was rectified.\nMeanwhile, as at the time of filing this report, elections were going smoothly in all the eight units located within the school’s premises while there was no report of violence.\nEfforts to speak with members of the monitoring team from the British High Commission, however, failed as they declined comments.\nMr Wale Adebayo, a member of the team, said that they had no comment to make.\nIn Isan-Ekiti, where the All Progressives Congress (APC) candidate, Dr Kayode Fayemi, hails from, accreditation and voting commenced across many polling units between 8.03a.m and 8.38.\nIn Fayemi’s Polling Unit 009 Ward 11, accreditation and voting commenced at about 8:38 a.m. although INEC officials arrived at about 7:26 a.m.\nAccreditation and voting began in Polling Units 006 and 007 as well as 005 between 8: 03 a.m. and 8:10 a.m.\nAt Unit 009, no fewer than 345 names of voters appeared on the pasted registered list.\nIn Ikere –Ekiti, the home town of the PDP flagbearer, Prof. Kolapo Olusola, voters trooped out as early as 6.30 a.m. to various polling units.\nNAN reports that a huge crowd was sighted at the Ofamofuru Polling Unit 007, Ward 02, of Olusola.\nThe Presiding Officer of the polling unit, Mr Layeni Segun, had urged the voters to conduct themselves in an orderly manner after displaying the empty ballox box to those gathered.\nHe equally appealed to the voters to allow the elderly and nursing mothers to cast their votes first.\nOther polling units visited such as L.A Pilot Polling Unit,08, Ward 002, Custom Polling Unit,08, Idiyin Polling unit 006, Ward 002 also witnessed a massive crowd of voters.\nNAN reports that no fewer than 667,064 eligible voters had collected their Permanent Voters Cards (PVCs) out of the 913, 334 registered.\nNAN also

in Lagos for stealing garri\n•No, it did not happen, Govt reacts\nBy Olasunkanmni Akoni\nResidents have expressed shock and disapproval over an incident where a young boy of about seven year-old was burnt to death in Lagos, Wednesday, for allegedly stealing cassava flakes, otherwise known as “Garri,” describing it as “barbaric.”\nThe alleged boy was reportedly lynched for stealing by yet to be apprehended perpetrators.\nResidents who reacted to the incident have called on Nigeria Police authorities to go after the perpetrators and bring them to justice to serve as deterrent to others.\nOne Ms Sharon Samuel reacted thus: “If the killers of this boy are not brought to book then there is no more hope for anyone in this country. Garri seller, may be your garri is meant for ritual purpose else why should you raise an alarm that caused the death of this boy. Don’t blame Buhari but blame our wicked world. The end is more than near,” Sharon said.\nAnother who identified simply as Queen Chi Chi, said, “What about those bank armed robbers, what about Nigerian politicians that are busy stealing and syphoning Nigeria’s money into their private accounts, are they not thieves? Why beating the boy to death because of ordinary garri, dastardly things to do.”\nEbere Chidima, another resident, said, “Those that burnt that little boy for merely stealing garri and even those that stood by and watched the sin being committed are guilty of the same offence. Jesus Christ said; he who is without sin let him cast the first stone. “The Police authorities should go after these perpetrators of this dastardly act.”\nNo, it did not happen, Govt reacts\nHowever, Lagos State Government, while reacting to the incident purportedly carried out in the state, through the state’s Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Mr. Steve Ayorinde, urged residents, especially users of social media as a source of news and social interaction to be mindful of the source of their information to avoid spreading false and unsubstantiated materials.\nAyorinde denied the alleged brutalization and killing of a 7-year-old pilferer that reportedly happened at a certain location in Lagos being circulated on social media.\nAccording to the commissioner, the Lagos State Police command has duly issued a statement questioning the authenticity of the story while asking for eye witnesses or anyone with verifiable information to come forward with information as the Police continue with their investigation.\n“While we condemn in its entirety every form of crime and jungle justice, it is important to plead caution whenever a human life is involved. So far, there is no indication that the dastardly act being peddled on social media happened anywhere in Lagos State or that it is a recent case.\n“The Police have promised to carry out further checks and will welcome every useful information, but available information at the moment does not suggest that such killing happened last Saturday at either Orile-Iganmu or Badagry. There is no any corpse that fits the description in any area being touted; just as the location of anyone with useful information to corroborate the sad tale being peddled cannot be established,” he said.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"http://www.vanguardngr.com/2012/11/constitution-amendment-lawmaker-escapes-lynching-in-kano/Lynching","2":"718","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999713898"},{"0":"Dr. Chris Ngige, Labour and Employment Minister\nBy Adesina Wahab\nThe Academic Staff Union of Universities, ASUU, is waiting until midnight today, Tuesday, for the Federal Government to meet its demands or risks the union embarking on another round of strike.\nChecks by Vanguard, on Tuesday, revealed that the national leadership of the union wants to give the government the benefit of doubt and let the ultimatum the union gave it lapse before taking the next step.\nThis is just as the National Executive Committee, NEC, meeting of the union may hold on Thursday, if government fails to do the needful, it was gathered.\nREAD ALSO: We’re not starting strike Tuesday — ASUU\nThe likely scenario is NEC rescheduling the meeting for Wednesday and Thursday, if by midnight today the Federal Government does not reach them.\nThe CBN angle\nAlso, the union has accused the government of buck passing by claiming that the delay in releasing funds to meet some of the union’s demands is caused by bureaucracy at the Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN.\nSpeaking in a chat with the Vanguard, the Chairman of ASUU, University of Ilorin, UNILORIN, branch, who is also a member of NEC of the union, Prof. Moyosore Ajao, said the government is taking the issue with levity.\n“By midnight on Tuesday (today), the deadline given the government to meet our demands would lapse.\n“As we talk, it is not yet midnight and anything can still happen.

From then till now, it is almost nine months.\n“What are they saying is delaying them in doing their part of the deal? Will it take them a year to get money to pay us?\n“If the government is saying the delay is from the CBN, the bank is an agency of the government like the ministries involved in the matter, among others.\n“I don’t think the government is saying that it is ASUU that will go and twist the arm of the CBN for it to release the funds,” he said.\nAjao added that as soon as the national leadership of the union knows where the government is heading, it would follow up on the next step.\nRecall that the union leaders and the government team met on August 2, this year to assess the level of implementation of last year’s truce terms and the union gave the government till the end of August to meet some demands.\nThe union wants the government to sign and implement the renegotiated agreement, mainstream the Earned Academic Allowances and pay the N40 billion Revitalisation Fund.\nRecall that the union and the Federal Government had a face-off that led to a nine-month-strike by ASUU last year.\nThe strike was called off last December. But up until now most of the promises made by the government are yet to be fulfilled.\nOther issues that union wants the government to address are the implementation of the Integrated Personnel Payroll and Information System, IPPIS, and the proliferation of universities, especially by state governments in the face of poor funding of the same.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"https://www.vanguardngr.com/2021/08/again-strike-looms-as-ASUU-waits-till-midnight-for-fg-to-meet-demands/amp/?__twitter_impression=true","2":"780","3":"Education","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999694824"},{"0":"…Presidency picks holes in it\nThe newly-released book “Boko Haram Media War: An Encounter with the Spymaster”, has listed over twenty-five major towns and cities recaptured by the Nigerian military during the administration of President Goodluck Jonathan before the final handover to President Mohammed Buhari.\nThe book, authored by Yushau Shuaib, revealed: “At the twilight of Jonathan’s administration when Sambo Dasuki was the National Security Adviser, dozens of towns and cities in Adamawa, Borno and Yobe states were recovered and confirmed with video and pictorial evidence through military press releases.\n“Some of the liberated towns include, but not limited to: Abadam, Askira, Baga, Bama, Bara, Buni Yadi, Damboa, Dikwa, Gamboru-Ngala, Goniri, Gujba, Gulag, Gulani, Gwoza, Hong, Kala Balge, Konduga, Kukawa, Marte, Madagali, Michika, Monguno, Mubi, Vimtim among other communities with pictorial and video evidences provided by the Defence Headquarters.\n“In one day alone, April 30, 2015, at least 234 abductees (women and children) were rescued by the military who had stormed sections of the Sambisa Forest.\n“A clear testimony to some of the accomplishments was the official DHQ release dated March 16, 2015, with reference No: DHQ/ABJ/901/32/DDI and titled: “Troops Finally Rout Terrorists from Bama and Last Stronghold in Yobe.”\nThe book in other sections, revealed glowing tributes paid to detained former National Security Adviser (NSA) Sambo Dasuki by some current top officers of the Buhari administration.\nIt disclosed how a top Buhari’s adviser commended Dasuki in an opinion article on May 1, 2015, for ensuring successes of the military operation against Boko Haram.\nIn another chapter, the book disclosed how one of Buhari’s spokespersons had predicted that Dasuki would face stiff challenges as Fulani man from North-West against Kanuri people of North-East who would frustrate him after his nomination by President Jonathan as NSA.\nHowever, the book has been attacked by the Presidency over a claim in its foreword by Dasuki where he said Nigerian military intervention in the North-East in 2015 enabled the last general elections to be conducted in the area.\nA statement by the Presidential spokesperson, Garba Shehu said: “The residents of the areas… were able to vote, not in their hometown but in refugee camps in other parts of Borno State under a special arrangement made by INEC.”\nGarba, who claimed that he had not fully read the book before making his official statement, said “We will have to read the entire text to offer a full and adequate response”\nIn a written piece in 2012, the said Buhari’s spokesperson even recommended and listed some Kanuri people that should have been considered for the appointment rather than the Sokoto Prince. The official had claimed that the appointment of Dasuki as a Northerner might produce the direct opposite result of appeasement of the region. According to Buhari’s pubilicist “the Boko Haram terror movement is dominated by Kanuri boys, despite the recruitment of volunteers from areas outside Borno and Yobe States, adding that Dasuki’s appointment ignored the historical rivalries between the Kanuris and the North-west or more directly, the Fulani hegemony.”\nThe book also discloses how security and anti-corruption agencies monitored movements of cash in local and foreign currencies by the two major political parties, APC and PDP to win primaries and main elections in 2015.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"http://www.vanguardngr.com/2017/07/north-east-nigerian-military-liberated-25-towns-jonathan-new-book-reveals/","2":"828","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9977670908"},{"0":"The domain name\nGISTFUL.COM is for sale.\n$2525Lease to Own\n$243 / monthExpert curated premium domain name\nProfessionally crafted logo design\nGuaranteed transfer or your money back\nA neat name that plays on words like 'gist' and 'wistful' in one eye-catching package.

Most of the brands and websites they already trust, use the .com extension. Therefore, it serves as a subtle indicator that your business is a legitimate one. A recent study by the NCC Group, a global expert in cybersecurity and risk mitigation, found that roughly half of the consumers are uncomfortable visiting websites ending with a non .com extension, and only 9% are comfortable doing so.\n- Brand Protection - When you own the .com version of a domain name, you have the official online version of that name. Owning an exact-match .com can protect your brand name, as it is unlikely another serious business would use the same name when the .com extension is taken.\n- Easy to Communicate - .com domains are also easy to communicate. When people hear or see your business name without a TLD, they will inevitably assume it ends in .com, making it easy for them to find you online.\nOnce you have received the name into your registrar account, you will be able to:\n- Use the domain as your website address.\n- Setup email addresses, for instance, email@example.com.\n- Use the domain and logo on business cards and other materials.\nIf you don’t have a website built yet, you can put up a simple coming soon page, or you can just leave it until you are ready. You don’t need to do anything right away. Because you own the domain name, you can take your time.\nOur talented community of logo designers designs all logos on the BrandBucket marketplace. They are paid for their efforts, and BrandBucket owns all copyrights for the logos. We will transfer the full copyright for the logo to you upon purchase of the domain name.\nLogo files are delivered to you in the following formats:\n- High-resolution image file (PNG)\n- Editable vector file (.AI)\nEditing your design\nVector (AI) files are entirely editable in programs such as photoshop and illustrator, so you or your designer can make desired changes. If needed, we can make basic color changes/small tweaks to the logo for you after purchase. If you are looking for a complete redesign, we can connect you with a designer from our talented design community at their discretion and price.\nAll of our business domains are carefully chosen for their standout branding qualities. There is only one gistful.com. However, there may well be other businesses that are using the same brand name. In fact, with common keyword names, it is likely. That is why owning the .com is so essential. In holding the .com, you immediately establish your business as the most official version of that name. It's unlikely any serious business is going to use a brand name where the .com domain is already in use. Many companies believe that owning the matching .com version of a business name provides more protection for their brand than a trademark.\nNo, and it’s not possible for us to do so. Trademarks are industry and region-specific, and to file a trademark for a name or logo, you must already be doing business as that name. Because of this, we can't trademark a name before your company is actively using it. Therefore, you will need to apply for trademark registration after you have purchased the name.\nWhen you purchase a domain from BrandBucket, you will own it 100%. However, all domain names worldwide must be kept registered at a registrar like Godaddy or similar that you choose. You will pay the registration fees to whichever registrar you decide to use. The price of registration varies at each registrar, but it generally ends up being around $10-15 per year for a .com domain name. Registration is annual but can be paid up for years in advance, which we suggest you do.\nBrandBucket serves as a third-party marketplace and escrow agent for domain names. We only offer refunds if either of these two conditions are met:\n- The buyer contacts us within 24 hours of purchase requesting a refund.\n- The seller fails to initiate the domain name transfer within 10 business days from the time of purchase.\nBuyers are advised to perform all necessary diligence prior to making a purchase.\nYour purchase is 100% confidential. Any personal information you share with BrandBucket is kept private, even from the domain seller. We never publicize any sale on our marketplace.\nA brand name is a name that you use to identify a family of products, services, or a single line of products or services that a company offers. For instance, Apple is the brand name used on most products manufactured by Apple, Inc. In this example, the business name and brand name are the same, a common use case.\nYour brand name is who you are to your customers. It is the pillar your business's public image will be built around. The products or services you offer can also have their own brand names. You may want to create new brand names for products or services that differ from your core business offering, for example:\n- UberEats - Food delivery by Uber\n- Amazon Web Services - Cloud computing from Amazon\n- Google Maps - Web mapping service from Google\nRegistered Business Name\nA business name is the legally registered name of your business. You'll use your business name to create contracts, open bank accounts, pay taxes, and any other administrative related activities. Most business names contain the business's brand name, followed by the company's chosen business structure, for example:\n- Walmart Inc.\n- Verizon Inc.\n- Grasshopper LLC\nHowever, they don't necessarily have to be the same. In some cases, the business name is completely different from the brand name. This is most common in large businesses that have multiple brands housed under a single parent company, for example:\n- Brand Name: Google\n- Business Name: Alphabet Inc.\n- Brand Name: MailChimp\n- Business Name: The Rocket Science Group LLC\nA domain name is your website name - the internet address where people can access your website. Think of a domain as the address to the online version of your business. Every domain is one-of-a-kind. No website has the same web address as another website.\nIdeally, your domain name should be an exact match to your brand name. Think of your favorite companies. Odds are, their domain name is identical to their brand name. Apple's domain name is Apple.com; Amazon's domain name is Amazon.com. Having a matching domain ensures that people can easily find your brand online.\nWhat can a top brand name with a matching .com do for your business? Here are few of the many advantages of owning a premium business domain:\nTrust - Online, there are subtle clues that all of us subconsciously take into consideration to determine whether or not a business is legitimate and trustworthy. Having a great business name paired with a matching .com (by far the most trusted domain extension) signals to customers that you care about and are willing to invest in your brand. It makes your business and your brand messaging easier to trust.\nAuthority - Owning a .com version of a fantastic brand name is a big signal to the world that your business means business, right out of the gate. This can lead to accelerated customer acquisition, more industry partnership opportunities, and press attention.\nSEO - Having a business domain that matches what customers are using in searches can lead to increased SEO, higher page ranking, and better quality traffic.\nRetention - Brand retention is critical for organically acquiring and keeping customers. A short, catchy, and unique business name makes your brand easier to remember, and having a matching .com means that consumers who hear about you offline will find you easily online.\nSave on marketing spend - Investing in a premium domain can save you a fortune in marketing spend down the line. You'll spend less of your valuable marketing budget and efforts on brand awareness, as your name will do much of the work for you.\nOur customers are primarily entrepreneurs looking for a quick and easy way to find a great brand name for their company. That's why when evaluating and appraising domain names, our central focus is whether they would also make great business names.\nWhat makes a great brand name? Here are some of the branding and linguistic traits we take into consideration:\n- Length - Great names are concise and to the point. The shorter, the better!\n- Common phrase/expression - Names that are based on real phrases and expressions make great brand names because of their built-in familiarity and inherent catchiness.\n- Letter order - Some letters are more valuable than others and better together, especially when it comes to the first letters of a name.\n- Pronunciation and spelling - Names should be easy to say and understand. It should also be spelled as it sounds.\n- Industry match - Names should be a good fit for a particular industry, or be broad enough to attract buyers from multiple sectors.\n- Longevity - Great brand names are broad enough in scope to grow with a company as it expands and not die when trends fade.\n- Uniqueness - Great brand names are easy to spot because they stand out in a crowd.\n- Memorability - A brand name is no good unless people can easily remember it.\nThese criteria, along with historical sales data and current marketplace conditions, are used to determine whether a name is accepted to our marketplace, and how it's priced. Every name on our marketplace must score high in most or all of these categories to even be accepted. With an acceptance rate of only 10% of names submitted to our marketplace, BrandBucket sets a very high bar for the names we select.\nCustomers Also Loved\nThe following are business names for sale with similar qualities to gistful.com","1":"http://www.gistful.com/2018/06/plateau-angry-youths-take-over-government-house-turn-violentphotos/","2":"2978","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999160767"},{"0":"Commander of IGP Intelligence Response Team, DCP Abba Yyari with arrested kidnap kingpin, Hamish Wadume\n•I’m a political thug, not a kidnapper\n•I made N6m from a sitting governor\n•How I escaped from soldiers who wanted to kill me\n•Slain policemen identified themselves before soldiers killed them\n•Wadume’s uncle, brother, cousin reveal their roles\nBy Ifeanyi Okolie\nSuspected kidnap kingpin, Alhaji Hamisu Balla, a.k.a Wadume, who has been in the middle of the raging storm between the Nigerian Army and the Nigeria Police over the murder of three police operatives and two civilians by soldiers in Ibi town, Taraba state has finally opened up and made startling revelations.\nIn an exclusive interview with Saturday Vanguard, Wadume gave a blow by blow account of his encounter with both the police and his Army Captain friend in charge of the 93 Battalion, Wukari who aided his escape after his initial arrest by the police.\nWadume who expressed shock at the manner the soldiers opened fire on the Police Toyota Hiace Bus that was conveying him to the Taraba Police Command Headquarters in Jalingo said while he also sustained bullet wounds on his right thigh after the shootings, he never asked the army captain to rescue him from the policemen who arrested him.\nHe also explained that as at the time he crawled out of the bullet ridden bus, which somersaulted three times before landing into the bush, the policemen were still alive but he was surprised to see the soldiers who had pursued them to the check-point raining bullets on the policemen before he was whisked in a red colored car, to the home of the army captain. He added that after his leg chain and handcuffs were cut off by a welder invited by the army captain, he was greeted by a large crowd of residents of Ibi who were standing beside the corpses of the deceased policemen who were all brought to the home of the army captain.\nWith the sum of N550,000 in his pocket after he was rescued, Wadume said he fled Ibi Town and was hiding in the house of one of his friends, Meito, at Ungwachiki town but 24 hours, later some soldiers trailed him to his friend’s house and wanted to kill him. He therefore jumped out of the window and fled to the river bank, boarded a speed boat into Tunga area of Nassarawa State, where he spent a night before moving to the home of his maternal uncle in Kano State.\nMy name is Hamisu Balla, alias Wadume, 33 years old and I am from Ibi Local Government Area of Taraba State. I am married to four wives and I have four children. I attended Bula Primary school Ibi, but I dropped out from Government Secondary School Ibi at JSS 3. After I dropped out school, I started fishing business at the River Benue that flowed through Ibi Town. This was in 1996 and I did fishing for six years, but in the year 2002, I went into fishpond business. I used to buy fingerlings for N30 per one, nurture them for five months before selling them for N600 and N700. I started small with just two small ponds but I went on to get five more big ponds with 50 by 50 in size and five feet deep.\n“I am not a kidnapper, but I have sold arms to several kidnappers. I am a fisher farmer, I own fish ponds, I own a transport business. I am equally a political thug. I went into crime when some politicians came for me, they approached me through one Babangida Musa, who was also into fishing business.\nI got N6m from a sitting governor, N13m from APC, defrauded civil servant of N30m,\nIn June 2018, I deceived a lot of politicians who were vying for political offices that I had spiritual powers to enable them win their elections. I defrauded the governor when he came to Ibi and met the youths in my town. As the leader of the youths, the Governor met me and I promised to work for him and to also consult some Mallams who would pray for his success. The Governor gave me N2million at first and we exchanged telephone numbers. But one week before the election, the governor called me and asked me to come to the Government house and when I got there the governor gave me N4million cash to continue with the prayers. Immediately after the election, the governor called to thank me.\nI was also given N13million by the APC to prosecute the 2019 presidential election but I spent only seven million. I also defrauded a civil servant from Ibi of N30million.\nI contested the Taraba state house of Assembly under the YDP Ibi Local Government but I pulled out of the election and took my supporters to the PDP.\nMy initial arrest by the police\nI volunteered to follow the policemen when they came to arrest me at Ibi Town while I was drinking tea with some of my friends. They showed me their identity cards indicating that they were from the office of the Inspector General of Police and I volunteered to follow them, because I knew I could settle any problem I’m confronted with. The policemen handcuffed me and leg-chained me while I was inside their vehicle and the Army Captain wasn’t even there when the policemen came to arrest me and I don’t even know who informed him that I had been arrested.\nSlain policemen identified themselves\nWhile I was being taken out of Ibi, Town, the policemen passed the first check point which was being maned by some soldiers after they had identified themselves. They also passed the second check point which was maned by some Mobile Policemen. But when they got to the third one where we were attacked, four of the policemen alighted from their bus and they identified themselves to the policemen and exchanged banters. I was shocked when the soldiers came after us and rained bullets on our bus, killing those policemen. I was almost killed in the encounter. I was then taken to the army captain’s house. When I saw the corpses of the policemen and their agents in front of the Captain’s house I became very disturbed and I pretended as if I wanted to urinate and I escaped from the scene.\nHow I escaped from soldiers who wanted to kill me\nI called one Audu who is one of my boys who took me on his bike to Ungwachiki Town in Ibi Local Government and I passed the night in the house of Meito, my friend. But while I was there some soldiers came to Meito’s house and started looking for me and they were armed with guns and machetes and axes, I believed they wanted to kill me.\nI don’t know how they got information that I was in that house but I managed to escape through the window and fled to the river bank around 8pm where I boarded a speed boat to Tunga village in Nassarawa State. I spent a night in Nassarawa state before I boarded another commercial bus to Kano State. People couldn’t recognize me because of the Sallah holiday. I had N500,000 with me as I was running from the police and I took the money to my uncle’s house where I went to hide in Kano.\nWhile I was hiding, I instructed one of my bothers in Ibi to go to my house and take away all my rifles. My cousin also brought an idea that I needed some favorable stories to be written about me, so he engaged a PR company who were to link up with journalists to write the stories. I paid N3million for that.\nConfession of Wadume’s cousin\nI’m Kawu Moahmmed Kasuwa, 30 years old from Ibi Taraba State, I am a civil servant and I work with Ibi Local Government. I am an executive officer at the Admin Department. Wadume is my uncle, he is a younger brother to my mother. I was arrested in Zaria, because I made efforts to get journalists to write a favorable story in support of my uncle Wadume who was being hunted by the police. It wasn’t my idea, but one of my uncles who was residing in Lagos State, Ismalia Jita who called me and said that he wasn’t happy with the bad press my Uncle, Wadume was getting since the incident occurred.\nHe wanted me to raise some money to give to the reporters so they could come down to Ibi and speak with the natives and get a good story about the incident which will be favorable to Wadume. I asked for N3m and they sent me their company’s account number and I gave it to my brother, Awal who knew how the money was paid to the media out fit. I was arrested in Zaria while the police were looking for my uncle, Wadume. But I took them to my other uncle Awal in Abuja who I thought could help in their search for Wadume.\nI’ve always been suspicious of Wadume—Elder brother\nMy name is Auwal Balla, I’m 38 years old, married with four children, I am commercial motorcycle rider at Alaba Rago Market in Lagos. I am known as Auwal Wawa. Wadume is my younger brother and we were born of the same father and mother. I knew my brother to be a fish farmer, a transporter, political thug and a kidnapper. I never knew that my brother was into kidnapping until the police came looking for him after my brother was rescued from the IRT operatives who were killed by the soldiers he called. When Wadume called and asked me to help him hide all his rifles in his house, I asked him what he was doing with all those rifles and he said he was using them for politics.\nThen I called one Uban Delu, my step brother and asked him to go to where Wadume kept his rifles and take them away and hide them in a different place. I came to Abuja because some people suggested that we should get the House of Representatives member representing our area to assist us in this matter and the people who were to lead me to the Honorable member asked me to come to Abuja.\nWhile I was in Abuja, one of my nephews, Kawul called and suggested that we should get some media men to write favorable stories for him that will change people’s perception about him. I sold the idea to my younger brother and he bought it. I then asked Kawu to send me the account number of the company which I forwarded to Wadume and he credited the company with that money.\nI was in Abuja when the police came and arrested me and I confessed that I have been in constant communication with my brother since he was rescued from the police and I also knew that he was in my uncle’s house in Kano. I have always been suspicious of my brother because he was spending too much money and since his business was such that couldn’t yield big money but he always told me to relax, that he was a political thug and was making big money from politicians, it was when he was arrested and rescued that I knew that my brother must have been into kidnapping.\nWhy I harboured Wadume in my house—Uncle\nI’m Rayyanu Abdul, 46, from Kano State. I am married to a wife and I have six children. I am a civil servant and I work with Kano State Senior Secondary School Management Board, Kano. I am Wadume’s uncle, his mother is my elder sister. Wadume told me that he was into fish farming, car sales and cattle rearing but I didn’t know that my nephew was into kidnapping or any other crime.\nThree days after the killing of the policemen by the soldiers, I heard on radio that the police were looking for a wanted kidnapper, Alhaji Hamisu Balla, Wadume and that was when I knew that it was my younger brother that was in the middle of the storm and I became very shocked. Wadume’s elder brother, Auwal then called me and asked me if I had heard what happened to Wadume and I said yes. Wadume also called me himself and told me he was coming to my house but I asked him to stop at a filling station close to my house where I went to pick him up and took him into my house. When I discovered that Wadume had an injury on his thigh, I brought a doctor who started treating him. Wadume gave me N270,000 to stock the house with enough food stuff and my wife was preparing food for him. He took tea in the morning, ate rice in the afternoon and in the night he would take ‘tuwo’.\nIn 2017, I was poisoned and Wadume and his brother came to visit me in a rented apartment where I was living with my family. They asked if I had a house and I told them, I only had land on which I had built the foundation and I took Wadume to the site. He saw what I had done and he promised to complete the building for me. Early this year, he came and completed the building and he furnished it for me. The building is a three bedroom apartment. When he came with his injury, I gave him my room and I moved into my wives’ room and he was staying alone in his room. I don’t know if he was praying regularly in his room.\nThe Manhunt for Wadume\nThe manhunt by the Police to arrest and bring down Wadume’s kidnapping empire began in March 2019, when it received a petition from one Sheriff Umar of Kirikinua South Local Government Area of Kaduna State.\nThe petitioner stated that his cousin, Usman Mayo, was kidnapped on February 15, 2019, at Takum Local Government Area of Taraba State and his kidnapper demanded the sum of N200 million as ransom for his release. According to the petition, the family of the kidnapped victim negotiated and paid the sum of N85 million first, on March 11, 2019, but the victim was not released.\nAn additional N15 million was paid on March 16, 2019, making a total sum of N100m paid to the kidnappers yet the kidnappers refused to release their victim as they insisted that that the family must pay the N200 million they demanded.\nThe family therefore reported to the police and the IRT was drafted to investigate and track down the suspects behind the kidnapping and rescue the victim.\nIt was gathered that while investigations into the matter commenced, members of the kidnapped victim’s family paid an additional N20m to the kidnappers and the victim was released, but the police discovered during investigations that Wadume had strong links to the kidnappers, who got N120 million as ransom from their victim.\nFollowing confessions by some kidnap suspects in police custody which allegedly implicated Wadume, the police therefore went on his trail and succeeded in arresting him in his home town, Ibi on August 6. He was being driven to Jalingo by the police team when soldiers opened fire on them along Ibi-Wukari Road, killing three police officers and two civilians. The soldiers were said to have received orders from an army captain to kill the policemen.\nThe aggrieved Nigeria Police in a statement demanded to know why the soldiers killed the policemen even after identifying themselves that they were on official duty. The police equally wondered why the suspected kidnapper who was handcuffed and leg chained by the police was released by the soldiers and allowed to escape. The Army on its part claimed that the soldiers responded to a distress call and that the soldiers mistook the policemen to be kidnappers.\nThe heat generated by the incident prompted President Muhammed Buhari to set up a probe panel to investigate the incident. The panel was yet to submit its report when the police, on August 19 re-arrested him in Kano.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"https://www.vanguardngr.com/2019/08/wadume-apc-gave-me-n13m-for-2019-election/amp/","2":"3368","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999885559"},{"0":"EFCC Secretary never worked in Osinbajo’s law firm – Investigation\nFresh facts emerged on Saturday that the suspended Secretary to the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Mr. Ola Oluyede, has never worked in the law firm of Vice President Yemi Osinbajo called SimmonCoopers.\nHe had also worked for several years prior to the establishment of SimmonCoopers, according to a document sighted yesterday by The Nation.\nIt was gathered that Oluyede had worked as a consultant and managed corporate intelligence portfolio before joining EFCC.\nSocial media reports had claimed that the EFCC Secretary was unduly favoured by Osinbajo to be appointed to the position.\nBut the document seen by The Nation showed that the claim was “not only false but also discreditable to the person of Ola Olukoyede.”\nThe document said: “Oluyede has never stepped or walked into the office of SimmonCoopers all his life, not to talk of working for the law firm.\nRead Also: Osinbajo: Between columnist and calumny\n“In his career profile and curriculum vitae, which he submitted to the Senate during his confirmation hearing in November 2018, Olukoyede worked for a finance and investment company Ecodev Investment as an investment officer for about five years before he started his law career with Legal Research and Corporate Development Projects (LRCDP Consulting) as a research partner.\n“At LRCD, he acted as a consultant and managed corporate intelligence portfolio with a number of high profile organisations in clientele, including financial institutions and law enforcement agencies from 2002.”\nThe document gave more insight into the antecedents of Oluyede as an expert on anti-corruption strategies.\nIt added: “In 2008, he established Global Compliance (GRC) a governance, risk and legal consulting outfit as a managing partner where he led and managed as an attorney, Investigation and Civil Litigation of fraud and corruption on international aid projects.\n“He has also been involved for several years even preceding the establishment of SimmonCoopers partners, in the development and implementation of strategic policy documents for operations, legal and administrative units of various anti-corruption agencies, including EFCC, as a trainer and consultant.\n“Also in the same year 2008, he established his Law practice, Ola Olukoyede & CO, from where he joined EFCC.”","1":"https://thenationonlineng.net/efcc-secretary-never-worked-in-osinbajos-law-firm-investigation/amp/?__twitter_impression=true","2":"521","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999313354"},{"0":"Nigeria’s senate president Bukola Saraki has lost his re-election bid to the Red Chamber to the ruling All Progressives Congress’s candidate Ibrahim Oloriegbe.\nSaraki currently represents the Kwara Central senatorial district in Ilorin, Kwara state.

What kind of CAN Chairman are you? Did your own Christianity teach you about revenge? You are an idiot. A total idiot. And I have no apologies for that.”\nPin-drop silence. Strange things do happen in Nigeria. But it had never been seen like that. For a father of the country to publicly excoriate a religious leader? For a Matthew to call a preacher an idiot, “a total idiot?” It was sacrilege walking on two legs.\nAnd again, for a President, who laid claim to being a born again Christian, to denigrate the association of his own faith? “CAN, my foot!” It was the height of it.\nOf course, Obasanjo was President! Big shot. But many things were wrong with his conduct and the cavalier treatment he gave to a priest, a man of God. The Holy Bible makes certain things clear about our spiritual leaders:\n‘Obey your leaders and submit to them. For they watch over your souls as those who will give an account. Let them do this with joy and not with grief, for this will be unprofitable for you.” Hebrews 13:17.\nAgain, we are charged: “But we request of you, brethren, that you appreciate those who diligently labor among you, and have charge over you in the Lord, and give you instruction.” 1 Thessalonians 5: 12. In fact, the next verse directly tells us to “esteem them very highly in love because of their work.”\nSo, for a Matthew to call a priest an idiot, “a total idiot?” Not acceptable by any stretch of the imagination. It was a bad example for all believers.\nWell, the saga ran for a while. The man in question, Rev Yakubu Pam, said security agencies summoned and asked him to apologize to the President for the public spat. Insult on injury! The two men continued with their public lives. Obasanjo finished in office, and went on to take a degree in Theology. I’m sure he now knows better about those the Holy Bible says “speak evil of dignities” (2 Peter 2:10), and the consequences. I believe he has privately repented.\nRev Pam finished his term as CAN Chairman in Plateau State. He went on to become Chairman of CAN in all North Central states from 2008 till 2015, and then, Chairman CAN in the 19 Northern states and Abuja, till July 4, last year, when he was named Executive Secretary of the Nigerian Christian Pilgrim Commission (NCPC), the regulatory body for Christian pilgrimage in the country.\nA tale of the priest and two Presidents. Publicly flagellated by one, a Matthew, and now, honored by the other, a Muhammadu. What Rev Pam didn’t get from a Christian, he got from a Fulani man from Daura, a Muslim. Is there any lesson we can learn from this? Think about it.\nA couple of weeks back, precisely on January 14, 2021, Rev Pam was at the Presidential Villa in Abuja, leading an NCPC team on a courtesy visit to the President. An idiot, “a total idiot” was at the seat of power, being treated with the dignity he deserved, by a man of a different faith. Holy Moses!\nRev Pam delivered a speech at the event, under the title, In Peace We Blossom. He recounted how he had been campaigning on the need for peace round the country in places like Southern Kaduna, Plateau, Benue, Taraba and Nasarawa states, among others. He has met with church leaders also in Southeast and South-south zones, as well as youth groups. He submitted: “I humbly appreciate Mr President’s vision on peace building and deeply grateful for the confidence reposed on me in this respect.”\nRev Pam is obviously a man of peace. That was why “when he was reviled, he reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatened not; but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously.” (1 Peter 2:23). How many of us would be called an idiot, “a total idiot” publicly, and would not talk back? How many of our modern day preachers, who arrogate all sorts of powers and authorities to themselves, would not have cursed Obasanjo publicly, asking him to apologize or be killed by God within seven days? (You know, some of these modern preachers speak as if God was their personal property, who they can command and order around).\nI tell you, this Rev Pam, from Gyel, Jos South Local Government Area of Plateau State is a reconciliator, a peace advocate, and that is why God has lifted him up today. And not through a Matthew, but a Muhammadu, one against whom all lies under the sun have been told: he’s a religious bigot. A herdsman. A nepotist. Jihadist. Everything. May God forgive those who condemn the person they don’t know, and have refused to know.\nPresident Buhari personally congratulated Rev Pam on his appointment as NCPC boss. He encouraged him to continue with his peace building efforts across the country, stressing that no enduring development could be possible without peace.\nIt was a day one was very glad to witness. A pauper can become a king. An idiot, “a total idiot,” can become a man of honour. It is God that does it. Don’t you think?\n*Adesina is Special Adviser to President Buhari on Media and Publicity\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"https://www.vanguardngr.com/2021/02/the-priest-and-the-president-by-femi-adesina/","2":"1419","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999885559"},{"0":"Scientific paper credits ‘the Creator’ for human hand design\nJournal is forced to retract after outcry\nControversy is raging after a peer-reviewed open-access scientific journal, PLOS ONE, published a paper1 recently by a team of four Chinese researchers (three in China, one in Massachusetts).2 The paper dealt with everyday topics such as how human hands grasp objects, and showed these actions that we take for granted require “complex biomechanical architecture”. But this would hardly have been controversial if not for its ‘unfortunate’ use of some extremely taboo language: the researchers in multiple places referred to the Creator. E.g., the Abstract states:\nThe explicit functional link indicates that the biomechanical characteristic of tendinous connective architecture between muscles and articulations is the proper design by the Creator to perform a multitude of daily tasks in a comfortable way.1\nThe Introduction includes:\nThus, hand coordination affords humans the ability to flexibly and comfortably control the complex structure to perform numerous tasks. Hand coordination should indicate the mystery of the Creator’s invention.1\nThe public outcry was swift and fierce! One editor at the journal posted, “Just found out @PLOSONE published a paper with ‘evidence’ about some ‘creator’. If not retracted immediately, I will resign as editor.” Buckling to the pressure, the journal did exactly that shortly afterward, with the following statement:\nIn light of the concerns identified, the PLOS ONE editors have decided to retract the article, the retraction is being processed and will be posted as soon as possible [sic]. We apologize for the errors and oversight leading to the publication of this paper.3\nPerhaps even sadder than the public response to this paper, however, was that even the authors of the paper themselves seem to have backed down. They attempted to blame references to the Creator on errors in translation, rather than a belief in intelligent design. E.g. the first author wrote in the Comments:\nWe are sorry for drawing the debates about creationism. Our study has no relationship with creationism. English is not our native language. Our understanding of the word ‘Creator’ was not actually as a native English speaker expected. Now we realized that we had misunderstood the word ‘Creator’. What we would like to express is that the biomechanical characteristic of tendious connective architecture between muscles and articulations is a proper ‘design’ by the ‘nature’ (result of evolution) to perform a multitude of daily grasping tasks. We will change the ‘Creator’ to ‘nature’ in the revised manuscript. We apologize for any troubles may have caused by this misunderstanding.1\nBut one must wonder if they really mean this, as even one of their critics responded:\nWe would take this defense seriously if it were the only creationist phrase in the article. But it isn’t. You also talk about hand coordination as evidence of “the mystery of the Creator’s invention.” What mystery is that? Is there a mystery how evolution by natural selection could produce the coordination in question?1\nPerhaps they don’t want to be blacklisted from ever being published again?\nFallacy: “Why don’t creationists publish in peer reviewed journals?”\nMisotheists and their churchian allies (‘useful idiots’), when they can’t refute a creationist argument, often taunt biblical creationists (and Intelligent Design theorists) with the following challenge:\nIf there’s really good evidence for Design, then why don’t you submit papers to a secular peer-reviewed scientific journal and gain the support of the mainstream scientific community?\nThis incident should serve as a perfect response to any such challenge, and a ‘test case’ for what happens in such a circumstance. Far from giving due consideration, the so-called scientific community does the exact opposite: they scorn and bully anyone who would dare attempt to suggest a Creator, and do their best to prevent any such evidence from seeing the light of day. There would be pressure to remove any editor who allowed this to be published.\nThis is the same type of behavior documented in Ben Stein’s movie Expelled, as well as the book Slaughter of the Dissidents by Dr Jerry Bergman. The simple truth is, the secular academic world is not open to considering evidence for a Divine Creator. The very concept of intelligent design is anathema to them, and they will stop at nothing to prevent any hint of such a Creator from breaking through the pages of secular scientific literature. The oft-cited ‘amazing admission’ by Dr Richard Lewontin once again is relevant here.\nThe Hand: evidence for design\nIn reality, the human hand is great evidence for the design of our Creator. For those who have not stubbornly rejected the truth, this simple fact seems obvious! One calls to mind the revulsion of Charles Darwin himself upon viewing the beauty of a peacock feather,4 which he knew he could not explain away by naturalistic means.5 I wonder– do today’s misotheists, such as the editor at PLOS ONE who threatened to resign his position over the mere mention of a ‘Creator’, experience a similar revulsion at the sight of their own hands?\nReferences and notes\n- Ming-Jin Liu, Cai-Hua Xiong , Le Xiong, Xiao-Lin Huang, Biomechanical characteristics of hand coordination in grasping activities of daily living, PLOS ONE, 5 January 2016 | doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0146193.

When the Government laid out its current five-year development plan, the forecast for 1983 was that production of high-priced oil, at two million barrels a day, would earn the nation $30 billion.\nAs world oil markets faltered last year, the forecast was trimmed in November in an austerity budget based on production of a million barrels a day. At the time, industry analysts reckoned that, for the first quarter of 1983 at least, black Africa's largest oil producer would be able to pump 1.3 million barrels a day, about the December level.\nThe forecasts were wrong: In January, oil industry sources and Nigerian officials said, daily production was no more than 880,000 barrels, despite the expectation of high sales to wintry America and Europe. Early February was worse: 550,000 barrels a day.\nThe implications are serious. Nigeria, which faces elections in August, is spending far more than it is earning. Some prestige projects, like a $2 billion standard gauge railway, have already been shelved. Commercial Payments Slow\nMoreover, the nation's foreign exchange reserves have fallen to just over $1 billion, enough to finance one month of imports, and that figure, the ecoomist said, is only ''notional'' because outstanding commercial payments are much higher. One Western banker put Nigeria's commercial debts at ''$6 billion minimum.'' Other estimates vary between $5 billion and $7 billion, compared with a relatively low long-term debt of $12 billion.\n(Banking sources in London said that Nigeria had begun talks aimed at getting a $1 billion credit to repay some of its commercial debts, Reuters reported Tuesday.)","1":"https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/17/business/economic-strains-on-nigeria.html","2":"345","3":"Politics","4":"2","5":"en","6":"0.9998874664"},{"0":"Okonjo-Iweala closer to emerging WTO DG\nBy Samuel Oamen\nFormer Minister of Finance, Dr Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala has drawn closer to emerging Director General of the World Trade Organisation (WTO).\nIn the final two-man race, she polled 104 votes from 164 member countries to defeat South Korea’s Trade Minister.\nShe may become the first African to head the WTO.","1":"https://thenationonlineng.net/breaking-okonjo-iweala-emerges-wto-dg/","2":"89","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9993631244"},{"0":"BY Favour Nnabugwu\nFederal Government Tuesday set in motion modalities to generate N500 bilion annually from its highways.\nThis came at a time a proposal to restrict trucks and tankers to dedicated service lanes on Oshodi-Apapa Expressway was presented to President Goodluck Jonathan.\nMr. Mike Onolememen, Minister of Works, who disclosed this at the inauguration of Road Sector Reform Committee in Abuja, said the federal roads could only be effectively maintained and sustained through revenue generation model in order for the sector to play its pivotal role to the nation’s economy.\nHe said: “It is estimated that about N500 billion could be generated yearly with over two million jobs created nationwide.\n“With a current asset value of about N5 trillion, there is need for sustainable development and maintenance of our country’s road transportation infrastructure to provide safe, reliable and free-flowing system for motorists and other road users in order to facilitate economic activities in the country.”\nOnolememen who gave the committee six weeks to come up with draft policies on road transportation, said Nigerian roads could be sustainably managed if the country’s road users paid users’ charge and other road-related charges.\nHe said: “If Nigerians could just part with a little road related users charges here and there, we will all be in a better position to benefit from very good roads. Nigerians will have a pleasurable drive on our roads.”\nOn Oshodi-Apapa Expressway, the minister disclosed that his ministry had made a proposal to the President to have a dedicated service lane for trucks and tankers on the expressway in Lagos so the tankers and heavy duty trucks would not obstruct traffic flow for other vehicles plying the road.\nHe stated: “We have made a proposal to Government and we want to hold Nigerian Port Authority and tankers accountable for implementing the proposal because we believe they have no business on that road.\n“We have also recommended a dedicated service lane for the users of tankers and trucks going to the port and tank farms.

It is no longer, in modern days, a purely charitable venture\n“Any sector that like the Nigerian road sector that has an aseet valued at N5trillion is big business and must be manged along a rigid business line in order to maximise efficiency.”\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"http://www.vanguardngr.com/2011/10/fg-targets-n500bn-annual-revenue-from-highways/","2":"601","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.999961853"},{"0":"•Says Jonathan, Govs, NASS members looted the country dry\n•Insists Igbo are not marginalized\n•Buhari’s administration an answered prayer\nBY FRANCIS IGATA\nFIERY Catholic Priest and Founder, Adoration Ministries Enugu Nigeria, AMEN, Reverend Fr. Ejike Mbaka,yesterday, urged President Muhammadu Buhari to be on his guards, prophesying that alleged beneficiaries of massive corruption perpetrated during ex-President Goodluck Jonathan’s administration would plot to kill him.\nMbaka made the revelations yesterday morning during his New Year Prophetic Message at Adoration Ground, where thousands of faithful converged for supplication.\nThis is even as the Enugu- based cleric lashed out to ex-President Jonathan, governors and National Assembly members under his administration some of whom were allegedly involved in the squandering of the country’s resources during the oil boom to detriment of critical infrastructure that could have alleviated the sufferings of the masses.\nHe asked Nigerians to brace up for tougher times this year due to the economic hardship. However, he urged them to be patient, prayerful and hard-working, adding that things would later improve. He also called for support for the Buhari administration’s anti-corruption fight.\nThere will be light at the end of the tunnel\nMbaka said: “People will by now, begin to question, is this the government we voted for? But the Lord says, it will start hard, but it is going to end well. It is going to end well. I am commanded to ask for patience. The Lord says that multiple crises will befall the system. But later, the country will be filled with the peace of Isaiah 66, peace that will be flowing like a river. And in this peace will be the blessing. So, I am claiming the peace in the midst of all the looming crisis.\n“New crises are going to come up. But at the end,there will be peace. Peace will be terbanacled at the epicentre of this country,to handle any crisis no matter how benign, malignant, barbaric or even satanic it will appear like. God says He will be in charge. In 2013, there was a prophecy that there was going to be an oil doom after the oil boom. And when that message came out from this ground, many started calling me a prophet of doom.\n“How can there be a doom? And the oil price continued to climb. And the message said, people and government should begin to gather, as in the days of Joseph, to stop squandering our wealth. And they never listened. Throughout the six years of the past administration, God blessed our oil with high prices, $140 per barrel. But the message said there was going to be an oil doom. Do not mind the high prices. It warned our politicians to stop embezzling our wealth. But they said the money would continue to come.\n“Our oil would continue to flow. During this moment of the oil boom, there was excess crude oil money. They did not know what to do with our money. Our youths were suffering and they are still suffering. Graduates have no jobs, new industries were not built. Our roads were not reconstructed.\nOur hospitals were in shambles and in total collapse. Our educational systems were in shambles and these politicians were building good schools outside Nigeria.\n“They were busy building hospitals even in South-Africa and other neighbouring countries. When any of them is sick, he will be flown outside Nigeria because there is no hospital in Nigeria worth of good medication. You cannot find any hospital in Nigeria that has worthy diagnostic facilities. The entire money voted for hospitals were looted. Corruption was in quantum to the level that Nigerian Catholic Bishops had to compose a prayer against bribery and corruption.\n“The Bishops assured all the Catholics to be praying that prayer everyday after the communion. All the moneys voted for road constructions were swindled. Many of the politicians became millionaires and billionaires in Naira, Dollars, Pounds Sterling, Euro when they have no workshops and business centres. Somebody who has nothing doing, yet he is a billionaire because he is a politician. The oil money was messed up.\n“Now, oil doom has come. There was no preparation for the doom. The economy of Nigeria is an oil-based economy. My beloved Nigerians,those who led us for the past six years downwards have killed this country. None of them is qualified to stay in this country by now. Both the president, governors, senators, House of Representatives members, council chairmen among others. They are wicked. It does not matter the man of God they worship with. Before God and man, all of them are wicked.\n“They hate this country. They succeeded in removing the liver, kidneys and cardiovascular system of this country and paralyzed the neurological organs, and handed over to Buhari, shambles and skeleton. A nation that is in comatose. Nigeria right now,economically and security wise is in the Intensive Care Unit, ICU. If the oxygen is removed, Nigeria will go. People of God prayed from here and there, and God answered our prayers and gave us Buhari.\nBuhari is God-sent\n“I want to tell you today, that Buhari is a prayer answered. Weather you hate or like him, Buhari is a prayer answered. The Catholic Bishops of Nigeria prayed against bribery and corruption and this President came with a war against corruption. All the prayers we have been doing against bribery and corruption, God answered the prayers through a Muslim who decided not to discriminate. There is nothing like racial, ethnic discrimination in this administration.\n“He is a man of all. He means good for this country and we owe him unalloyed, consistent, spiritual and otherwise support. If he is not the man at the helm of affairs now or had it being the last regime continued, by now, Nigeria would be for sale. Who will buy? All the moneys voted for infrastructure, few people stole the money. That is why we are passing through chronic hunger, joblessness. Many have died and are still dying because of this. That is why they want to engineer you people to cause crisis even in this part of Igboland under the guise that Igbo are marginalized.\nNobody can marginalise Igbo\n“Igbo people are unmarginalizable. Nobody can marginalize the Igbo. The spirit of God wants me to speak good over what has been happening in this administration and that is what I am doing. I am not a sycophant,I do not support anybody for anything because I have the highest thing somebody can have which is God. So, I want to tell you that so far, God is happy with Buhari. And he who God has blessed, may you not try to curse because God will curse you.\nThe plots to kill Buhari\n“Many people are planning, as it is revealed , to kill Buhari. There are many plans on how to eliminate his life so that corruption, embezzlement will continue. But the Lord says, God who put you there, will not forsake you. Be firm, resolute, focused, unbiased and refuse to be intimidated and distracted. Go ahead and war against evil. Buhari, go ahead and war against corruption. God and His people are behind you. You are the answer of the prayers of the people.\n“Our past looters, embezzlers, thieves on the political terrain have eaten the cake and now everybody is suffering. No ethnic group is marginalized. In the present administration, Igbo people hold the portfolio for Minister of External Affairs, Godffrey Onyeama; Science and Technology, Ogbonnaya Onu; Industry and Commerce, Osita Enalema; Labour and employment, Chris Ngige. And the problem of this country now is unemployment. If our youths are well employed, kidnapping will go. Kidnapping was a child of the past administration. They delivered that ugly baby, which resembled them. It is my job to put your mind right. When anybody wants to say that Igbo are marginalised, do not believe it. Igbo are doing well everywhere. So,why are we evolving a war that does not exist?\n“Those who are engineering this war, have their children abroad! And they want to use our unemployed youths to begin to walk around, ‘Igbo are marginalized,’ ‘our roads are bad.’ By the end of this year, Buhari will expose the names of the people who looted money meant for our roads. What we are suffering now is the resultant effect of the last malignant administration that was intrinsically corrupt. What we are suffering now arose from past administration. But the Lord says there is hope. Many people are going to suffer. We should all get ready. But after the suffering we will all smile.”\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"http://www.vanguardngr.com/2016/01/2016-prophesy-there-are-plots-to-kill-buhari-mbaka/","2":"1904","3":"Religion","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999828339"},{"0":"Manchester United boss, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, is dreaming of signing Jadon Sancho in the summer.\nThe Borussia Dortmund man is wanted by several Premier League clubs as he looks to move back home after two seasons in Germany.\nMetro claims Solskjaer and United are confident of signing Sancho, even with COVID-19 hurting the finances of most Premier League clubs.\nAnd Sancho would complete the manager’s front three next to Anthony Martial and Marcus Rashford.\nThen United would have Paul Pogba, Bruno Fernandes and Scott McTominay in midfield to round off the attacking six.\nSolskjaer sees Sancho as the ideal right winger for his fast paced, youth oriented team.","1":"https://sportinglife.ng/solskjaer-wants-to-form-dream-man-utd-front-three-this-summer/","2":"153","3":"Sports","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9998207092"},{"0":"Joe Ajaero, NLC President\n— Holds prayer session at police state commands\n— On standby for strike if police detain NLC President\nBy Johnbosco Agbakwuru, Abuja\nIn solidarity with its President, the Nigeria Labour Congress, NLC, has mobilized its members, especially the Central Working Committee, CWC, to storm the Police headquarters, Abuja, as Comrade Joe Ajaero honours the summons by the Police over his alleged link to terrorism financing, among other allegations.\nRecall that the police had summoned the NLC President on Monday, August 19, to appear at the Force headquarters on Tuesday, August 20, by 10 a.m. to answer questions on his alleged involvement in terrorism financing, cybercrime, subversion, criminal conspiracy, and treasonable felony.\nThe summons necessitated an emergency National Executive Council, NEC, meeting, where the Congress condemned the action, describing the allegation as trumped-up charges and politically motivated to silence the workforce.\nA circular to all NLC affiliates and State Councils, signed by the General Secretary, Comrade Emmanuel Ugboaja, on mobilization for peaceful procession and prayer session in solidarity with the Congress President, Comrade Ajaero, said together they shall overcome the challenges and continue to uphold justice, fairness, and democracy in the country.\nThe circular read: “In response to the recent summons by the Nigeria Police Force for our President, Comrade Joe Ajaero, to appear for interrogation on trumped-up charges on Thursday, August 29, 2024, we call on all NLC affiliates and state councils to mobilize their members in Abuja and across the states to show solidarity.\n“Details for Participation: In Abuja: All CWC members resident in Abuja and other members are expected to assemble at the National Headquarters of the Nigeria Labour Congress by 8:00 AM on Thursday, August 29, 2024, to accompany the President to the Police for the scheduled interaction.\n“In State Capitals: Members should gather at their respective state secretariats of Congress. From there, they will embark on a peaceful procession to their State Police Headquarters, where they will hold a prayer session until the president’s interaction with the police is concluded.\n“This peaceful march is a united stand against the unjust actions aimed at intimidating our leadership and stifling the voice of Nigerian workers.

However, we wish to state unequivocally that this does not in any way legitimize the baseless allegations levelled against him.\n“Condemnation of the State’s Actions: The NEC strongly condemns the continued harassment of the leadership of the Nigeria Labour Congress and other Labour leaders.\n“We view this as a calculated attempt to weaken and destabilize the labour movement, which has always stood as a bastion of democratic principles and the voice of the Nigerian masses.\nCall for the State to Desist:\n“The NEC warns the state to desist from its evil intentions and stop the ongoing witch-hunt against the leaders of the Congress forthwith. The Congress will not sit idly by while the rights and freedoms of its members and leaders are trampled upon with impunity by the state.\n“The NEC directs all affiliates and state councils to immediately commence the process of mobilizing their members across the nation. The Congress will not hesitate to take all necessary actions, including mass protests and industrial actions, to protect the integrity and independence of the labour movement.\n“If anything happens to the President of the Congress or any other leader of the Congress in furtherance of these tendentious allegations by the State; NEC puts all its affiliates and state councils to proceed on indefinite nationwide strike action by 12:00 Midnight today.\n“The NEC calls on all civil society allies and the general populace to stand in solidarity with the Nigeria Labour Congress in this critical moment. The fight against injustice and oppression is a collective one, and we urge all Nigerians to rise in defence of our shared democratic values.\n“The Nigeria Labour Congress remains resolute in its commitment to defending the rights and interests of workers and the Nigerian people.

The meeting of the National Working Committee, NWC to shape the issues generated from the Tuesday meeting, it was gathered, would not come up before next Tuesday at the earliest.\nThough one of the points canvassed by the anti-Secondus forces at the strategic stakeholders’ meeting of governors, former governors, former principal officers of the National Assembly among others was for Secondus and the present NWC not to recontest, sources disclosed that that stance was, however, left out of the communique.\nREAD ALSO: Govs, BOT saved PDP from implosion — Wike\nA source revealed that a notable lawyer present and former minister, Tanimu Turaki had canvassed that it would run foul of the PDP’s constitution which provided NWC members the right to a second tenure.\nSaturday Vanguard, however, reports that no national chairman of the party had served a second term. None in the era of the four year tenure system which began with Chief Audu Ogbeh has also finished his term and considered a second term.\nParty insiders say that Secondus’ bid to upturn that record was one of the issues he had with some of the party’s principal influence pullers, particularly Governor Nyesom Wike.\nA second term for Secondus, party sources said, would also have destroyed the chance of the South-South getting the ticket of president or vice-president.\nThough, a senior party official disclosed that Secondus may not have completely aborted his second term plans, party leaders are said to be now gravitating towards the Southwest, which is the only zone in the country that is not averse to having the national chairman. All other zones with an eye to the presidential or vice-presidential tickets are said to be pushing the office of national chairman away from their zones.\nThe leading candidate for the office in the Southwest, it was gathered is Chief Olagunsoye Oyinlola, the penultimate governor of Osun State.\n“With Oyinlola, PDP will be killing two birds with one stone,” a party insider told Saturday Vanguard.\n“With him we have Obasanjo (President Olusegun Obasanjo) and IBB,” the source said.\nMeanwhile, Saturday Vanguard gathered that canvassers for Atiku Abubakar’s 2023 aspiration were also not particularly averse to the exit of Secondus despite the earlier notion that he was serving the interest of the campaign.\n“You can see what happened with Atiku visiting Wike and it tells you that nothing is impossible in politics,” the source said.\nIt was gathered that Atiku was looking towards pairing with any of the South-South governors in 2023.\nAfter burning up to N30 billion in 2019, Atiku it was gathered was now looking towards any of the governors from the South-South willing to throw in help towards actualizing his aspiration.\nDespite the rapprochement with Atiku which was helped by the former vice-president’s seeming quietness in the push against Secondus, the running mate offer from Atiku it was gathered is not Wike’s for the taking. It was gathered that the ticket remains open to any of the three eligible South-South governors; Wike, Udom Emmanuel (Akwa Ibom) or Ifeanyi Okowa (Delta).\nIt is a development that is bound to upset the Southeast and the aspiration of the zone which has made a bristling campaign for the president to come from the region.\nBesides the money factor, the Atiku Campaign it was gathered, is also conscious of the fact that the PDP has become a minority in the Southeast zone with the party controlling only two of the five states.\nThe Atiku Campaign is, however, expected to appoint a high profile Southeast person as campaign director general with the person emerging as the Secretary to the Government of the Federation in the event of a victory.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"https://www.vanguardngr.com/2021/08/zoning-intrigues-trail-secondus-crisis-in-pdp/","2":"1016","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999885559"},{"0":"Vital documents in suit on Jonathan’s eligibility stolen\nA Lawyer involved in the prosecution of a case challenging President Goodluck Jonathan’s eligibility in next year’s election, Wahab Olatoye, has said the vital documents needed to prosecute the case have been stolen.\nHe said some men broke into his office in Abuja last Friday and stole “most of the files containing documents to be used in the eligibility suit and other vital documents.”\nOlatoye and Adejumo Ajagbe filed the suit before the Federal High Court, Abuja seeking an order restraining the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and the Attorney- General of the Federation (AGF) from allowing Jonathan and Vice President Namadi Sambo to seek re-election next year.\nOlatoye said his office at Suite 33, Manga Plaza, Garki Area 11 was burgled on Friday night and vital documents he was using to pursue his case against the President and other vital documents were taken away.\nHe said he had reported the incident at the Garki Police station.\n“It is really a great surprise to me, when I was called on Saturday morning that my office had been burgled by yet- to-be identified persons.

Foreign outflows also decreased by 10.21 per cent from N21.36 billion to N19.18 billion within the same period.\nIt will be recalled that MTN and Airtel had indicated interest to list on the NSE once the economy improves and the Nigerian stock market remains attractive for both local and foreign investors.\nThe capital market operators who welcome the interest of the telecommunications companies to list on the exchange have warned the federal government not to do anything that will jeopardise or discourage the entities that will list on exchange come next year.\nPresident of the Institute of Capital Market Registrars, Bayo Olugbemi: said: “ We need these companies on the exchange to boost our market. MTN is a big company and has invested significantly and makes huge returns to stakeholders. So government must do everything it can to encourage it to list in our country. We expect other telecoms players as well as major oil companies and the power sector to join the train.”\nMeanwhile, speaking a Financial Management Consultant, Mr. Bisi Ogunwale, said the furour generated by the regulatory discrepancies between the MTN believed to have employed over half a million Nigerians and injected about 3.5 per cent of the country’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) may portend a negative picture to willing investors in the Nigerian economy.\nOgunwale said the accusations against the telco were not solidified as the withdrawal by MTN didn’t appear to contravene the Nigerian Investment Promotion Council act and the Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN’s regulation.\nHe said the government should rather check the efficiency of the regulatory measures of the CBN and necessary parties to avoid repelling foreign direct investors (FDIs).\nOgunwale said: “Just when we thought we were getting out of undue interference from our government in the way businesses are run, the upper chamber of the national assembly on the 27th of September did this. First, the issue here for me is what exactly is the Senate out to achieve and why are they doing what they are doing?\nI’ve looked at everything they brought forward and the issue that MTN did not get CCI before repatriating money. What funds are we talking about, MTN’s claims they were repatriating funds that were meant to be profit or dividends being paid on importation of capitals they have done.

Sagai said that micro-finance banks played a vital role in providing loans to small business owners without collateral, unlike the commercial banks.\n“Micro-finance banks are playing a very good role in building the economy from the grassroots. Just as the local governments are created to get closer to the people in political administration, the micro-finance banks are established to get closer to the grassroots in economic administration. We ensure that those who cannot get loans from the big banks with collaterals are able to get loans in an easy manner from us and start their small businesses.\n“In my local government in Bokkos, we give loans from N10, 000 up to N250,000 to the people without collateral,” he said. According to him, we are able to do this because we know them on one-on-one basis and the transaction is done within the shortest possible time and without rigorous procedures. Sagai added that the initiative was a “good vision that will improve the standard of living of indigents and increase the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of the nation.”\nHe advised the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to strictly allocate the funds to only qualified micro-finance banks that would disburse it to deserving business owners.\nHe further said the MFB’s would on their part ensure that the funds are utilized for the purpose for which it is being allocated. An economic expert, Mr Gabriel Okeh, said that though routing the funds to the entrepreneurs through micro-finance banks was good, it require proper monitoring by the CBN to ensure effective implementation.\n“Commercial banks do not usually do much to support industrialization; they rather go into buying and selling which is not so with the micro-finance banks,” he said.\nHe said, “it has become a Nigeria factor that such funds are collected by individuals who eventually use the money for their selfish interests rather than the purpose it is meant for.\n“The strength of industrialization in many countries is based on SMEs and Nigeria should not be excluded.\n“ Most of the products we consume were produced by small industries of not more than 20 staff or less, outside the country such as China and Japan. SME is supposed to be a base for industrialization because from small scale, they mature into bigger companies and are able to employ more people,” he said. Okeh, therefore, appealed to the Federal Government to create an enabling environment for SMEs to would allow them to put the loan to good use.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"http://www.vanguardngr.com/2014/08/stakeholders-commend-fgs-use-mfbs-disburse-n220bn-msme-fund/","2":"668","3":"Politics","4":"2","5":"en","6":"0.9999866486"},{"0":"By Dickson Omobola\nThe jigsaw puzzle surrounding the quantity of petrol, otherwise called Premium Motor Spirit (PMS), Nigeria consumes daily just got more puzzling as Sunday Vanguard understands that the figure went down to about 30 million litres per day after President Bola Tinubu’s ”subsidy is gone” statement of May 29, 2023, only to dramatically return to more than 60 million litres.\nMultiple sources attributed the ‘magical’ rise to renewed smuggling of the product into neighbouring countries where the price of the product is significantly higher than it is in Nigeria.\nUntil Tinubu ‘removed’ the petrol subsidy via the 2023 Inauguration Day speech, the product sold for N254 but rose subsequently to N617 in Abuja and thereabouts in some parts of the country.\nIn Lagos where it was cheapest, it sold for about N568 while it sold higher in other South-West states like Ogun, Oyo, Ondo, Osun and Ekiti.\nIn the North, South-South and South-East, it was a different ballgame as the price of petrol skyrocketed above N615 while independent marketers sold above N800.\nThe quantity of petrol consumed daily in Nigeria has for a long time been a controversial issue with many stakeholders saying it was shrouded in secrecy especially since the quantity determined the amount to be paid as a subsidy which many people including government officials benefited from.\nAccording to the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation Limited (NNPCL), in the first three months of 2022, Nigeria recorded an average daily consumption of 64.14 million litres, while the Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (NMDPRA) revealed in September 2022 that Nigeria’s average daily petrol consumption was 66.8 million litres.\nHowever, at the beginning of 2023, the Group Chief Executive Officer of the NNPC Limited, Mele Kyari, said there was no credible data to ascertain the daily consumption of petrol in Nigeria while also stating that there was credible data on the actual volume of petrol evacuated from the depots.\nAnalysts believe the figures quoted are often that high. The bulk of the petrol earmarked for the local market is usually taken by smugglers across the borders, especially to neighbouring countries, where the price of the product is very high because they don’t produce oil.\nThe smuggling of the product across borders guarantees huge profits for those involved while subsidy also guarantees huge returns for marketers and government officials among others in the system.\nBut following the Inauguration Day pronouncement of Tinubu (subsidy is gone), daily consumption of petrol in Nigeria, according to sector regulator fell significantly.\nAnalysis of daily truck-out data published by the NMDPRA revealed that petrol consumption had reduced by more than 24 million litres per day on average.\nThe average daily consumption in May 2023 was 69.54 million liters which fell to 49.48 million liters in June, representing a 28.3% drop.\nIn July, this margin increased further to 34.61%, the equivalent of 24.06 million litres, and average daily consumption for the month fell further to 45.74 million litres.\nThe price of petrol in neighbouring Benin Republic and Cameroon immediately soared, confirming the claim that both countries, among others, were befitting of the Nigerian subsidy regime.\nPart of the reason adduced by the Nigerian government to cancel the subsidy regime is the fact that apart from the cabal using the regime to rip off the government, nationals of neighbouring were also beneficiaries.\nBut critics say the fact that the government cannot police its borders in such a way that smuggling of petrol across the borders is stopped does not justify ending the subsidy regime that helps poor Nigerians to modulate the prices of other items that they need petrol to carry out.\nNigeria’s land borders are huge, covering an area of 923,769 square kilometres (356,669 sq mi) with borders Niger in the North, Chad in the North-East, Cameroon in the East, and Benin-Republic in the West.\nAnd with several footpaths that lead into the neighbouring countries and a few official border posts, smuggling of not only petrol but also other items like rice is difficult to control.\nMeanwhile, increases in the price of crude oil in the international market have led to a rise in the landing cost of the petrol imported into Nigeria.\nReports say the current landing cost is around N1, 100.\nThe implication of the landing cost of petrol has inevitably increased the subsidy margin to at least N600 per litre.\nNNPCL has been the only body importing petrol and bearing the brunt of the subsidy after marketers abstained from the operation simply because they are in business to make a profit.\nConsequently, the debt incurred by the NNPCL arising from the funding of the subsidy as of last week and as reported by Sunday Vanguard had ballooned to over $ 6 billion, a situation the government believed was unsustainable.\nThe setback, according to Sunday Vanguard sources, is apparently responsible for the lingering hiccups in fuel supply in recent weeks.\nOne of the sources familiar with the PMS importation into the country revealed that no fewer than five vessels, which were primed to supply petrol to Nigeria, had refused to discharge the product to NNPCL due to fear that they would not be paid cash on delivery.\nThe insider pointed out that the mounting debt had heightened the pressure on the petroleum company, which had resorted to rationing its stock and appealing to its long-term suppliers to not cut off supply.\nA senior official at the NNPCL, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the company was struggling to supply dealers due to a shortage of products at its disposal.\nThe official lamented: “Bulk sales of ships and trucks to depot owners have slowed down in the last five days due to shortage of supply”.\nThe source added that no bulk sales had taken place since Tuesday, resulting in the scarcity in the downstream sector.\nAnother NNPCL staff member told Sunday Vanguard that the fuel shortage, which resulted in long queues experienced in the last two months in petrol stations across the country, were principally caused by the reduction in supply of products by suppliers who were being owed by the Nigerian oil firm.\nThe top official said: “I was aware that at some points in mid-August the Federal Government had to come in by giving money to NNPCL to defray some of the outstanding liabilities and boost the confidence of the suppliers to continue.\n“However, what was paid was about $300 million, which only helped us get some reprieve for about a week before the queues fully returned,” he said.\nAnalysts say the increases in the price of crude in the international market have also pushed up the price of imported petrol in the neighbouring countries, thereby making the smuggling of the product from Nigeria where it is highly subsidized once again very attractive.\n”Smugglers are once again taking petrol across the borders like they were doing before and the development has, as it were, sent the quantity of petrol consumed daily by Nigerians skyrocketing to over 60 million litres”, one industry source told Sunday Vanguard, last week.\nComments

It becomes tortuous from Atan to Lusada. Don’t forget that the stretch is home to three private universities – Bells University of Technology, Covenant University and Crawford University – that should attract development but it didn’t happen until recently with the administration of Prince Dapo Abiodun.\nA tour of the axis showed manufacturing firms that closed their operations with gates and warehouses padlocked, filling stations that are out of use as a result of low traffic on the route.\nIt is a common sight to see tankers and trailers upturn at will, few commercial vehicles that ply the road carry excess passengers and charge exorbitant fees to make up for delays and longer travel time, wear and tear on their vehicles and the resultant high mortality of their vehicles. The road is lonely and the commonest means of transportation are the motor bikes popularly known as Okada. Before this reporter undertook the journey, she was advised by a colleague that to avoid delays as a result of the bad state of the road, she should board a bike but with a proviso that she must have a spare dress and a scarf because of the dusty nature of the road.\nNow, thankfully in 15 months that would be history. Noteworthy, and regrettably, so that several estates that were at various levels of completion were abandoned and several of those real estate companies folded.\nLittle wonder the flagoff and inauguration were like a carnival as people trooped out and greatful that the administration in Ogun State has given reasons to have a new lease of life. A guide and a resident in Lusada said land speculators had returned. He confided in this reporter that he bought his plot of land for N120,000 several years ago, but was surprised that the same plot is sold now for N600,000 because people saw construction ongoing. He lamented the deprivation they had suffered for years and pleaded with the governor to ensure the completion of the all important road.\nPrince Abiodun said the dual event was a symbolic demonstration of his administration’s commitment to the infrastructural development of all parts of the state.\nCommending the establishment of the Free Trade Zones (FTZs) in Ogun State by former governor, Otunba Gbenga Daniel, he said the establishment of FTZs was a veritable platform to help boost development, adding that its benefits are not limited to only reducing the fiscal intervention and leveling borders between nations. But also in his words, increases commercial flow; deferral, reduction or duty exemption; improved compliance; development of commerce and industrialisation; inventory tracking; quality control and indefinite storage.\nHe stated that his administration is not unaware of the resultant effect of the Free Trade Zones in terms of employment generation; poverty alleviation, job creation, local patronage, capacity building and perhaps, product varieties, which in the long run, put the state on the global map of trade and investment.\nHe said: “It is noteworthy to mention that this facility has grown beyond a Free Trade Zone to a community in its own class. And as such, a comprehensive development of commerce, processing of goods and manufacturing of varieties of products with the use of local raw materials and inputs have really boosted the economy of our dear State at large.”\nHe, however, lamented the misfortune of the state which though has a Free Trade Zone with great potential, but could not be accessed because of the dearth of infrastructure.\nAccording to him, the inauguration of this road is another milestone in the administration’s march towards industrialisation and economic development of the state.\nHe said: “This Lusada-Igbesa Free Trade Zone, on its own, is a practical demonstration of our administration’s wholesome infrastructural development plan towards improving on our Ease of Doing Business. In addition, we have other ancillary approaches to corroborate our commitment. These are in forms of policy formulation and programmes. For example, in accordance with the vision of our administration, creation of an enabling environment for business through Public-Private Partnership (PPP) is of utmost importance. These have necessitated implementation of key fiscal and institutional reforms aimed at driving efficiency and promoting transparency and accountability.\n“All these are directed towards ensuring that existing businesses continue to thrive and new ones are attracted. Today, we pride ourselves for garnering the third largest Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) into Nigeria the records are there to see.”\nFurthermore, the governor said the road is a symbolic representation of the positive dividends of his administration’s Public-Private Partnership (PPP) agenda. He commended the management of the Ogun Guandong Free Trade Zone, Igbega, as well as the entire team of the China Africa Investment for its commitment to the partnership towards creating what he called corporate and individual prosperity for all our citizens.\nHe continued: “No doubt, the construction of 10.25kilo metre Lusada-Igbesa road in partnership with the Ogun Guandong Free Trade Zone, Igbesa, is a commendable project. And, we are happy to have the road commissioned today in view of its benefits for improved investments and individual prosperity of all the people in Igbesa, Lusada and adjoining towns in this area. But, as an adjoining road, it is important to note that the full benefits of this newly constructed road can be realised only when the Atan-Lusada-Agbara road is rehabilitated and reconstructed. That import is not lost on us. We have just performed the ceremony of the turn of sod of the Atan-Lusada-Agbara road. All things being equal, the road will be completed soonest and both the Atan-Lusada-Agbara road and the Lusada-Igbesa Free Trade Zone road will complement each other for the full benefits of our people.”\nThe governor pledged to continue to improve on the several public-private sector partnership programmes to identify funding options for the rehabilitation and reconstruction of major roads in the state.\nHe canvassed the need for the people at this axis to take ownership of the Lusada-Igbesa road. “You are to ensure good maintenance of the road at all times. I also want to assure all our people that no parts of the state will be neglected in our infrastructural development agenda. In Ogun West, there are various road construction and rehabilitation that are on-going and some are nearing completion. These include, but not limited to Imeko-Afon-Agbede-Iwoye Road; Koro Otun–Itele Road, Ado-Odo/Ota; Empire Ground Road, Ilaro and Ota Owode Idiroko Road.\nOthers are Igbesa-Ejira Road; Papalanto-Ilaro Yewa Frontier Hotel Road and Sango-Joju Lagos/Abeokuta Expressway.\nHe called on investors and other players in the private sector to emulate the Ogun Guangdong Free Trade Zone, by identifying critical areas of investment that will really touch the socio-economic well-being of our people. He stressed that opportunities still abound in the state for investments in power, technology, industrial components, and exploitation of mineral products, among others.\nBoth events were attended by the Minister of Industry, Trade and Investment, Niyi Adebayo; Chairman, Senate Committee on Works and former governor of Kebbi State, Senator Adamu Aliero; Senator representing Lagos West and Chairman, Senate Committee on Finance, Senator Olamilekan Adeola; Senator Ayo Akinyelure, Senator Opeyemi Bamidele and Senator Micheal Nnachi, among dignitaries.\nWhile saying the road will be completed in 15 months, the governor said though the road, which is part of the Sokoto-Badagry Expressway, belonged to the Federal Government, his administration decided to embark on the reconstruction of the road to give succour to the residents and industries along the axis.\nAbiodun, who reiterated that his government would not develop any part of the state at the expense of another, disclosed that over 172 kilometres of road had been constructed, while 120 kilometres had also been rehabilitated across the length and breadth of Ogun State within two years of his administration.\nThe governor assured that all roads leading to industrial areas and farm settlements in the state will be prioritised to boost economic growth and development.\nHe commended the President Muhammadu Buhari-led Federal Government for the prompt approval of the request for the transfer of the rehabilitation, reconstruction and maintenance of Atan-Lusada-Agbara road to the state.\nHe, however, urged the residents along the axis to take charge of the project, disclosing that the youth in the area would be gainfully engaged during the construction of the road.\n“No doubt, today’s twin event of turning of sod of Atan-Lusada-Agbara road and commissioning of the Lusada-Igbesa road is part of our administration’s commitment to provide infrastructure in order to continue to open up our border communities along the axis.\n“It is, in fact, an assertion of our strategic and deliberate approach to reposition our industrial hubs in our dear state. And, no doubt, Ogun West, especially the Agbara Industrial Estate, which is one of the biggest industrial estates in Nigeria remains key to the development of Ogun State.\n“In this direction, the completion of Atan-Lusada-Agbara, expected in the next 15 months, will go a long way towards improving the quality of life and advancement of commerce in Ogun West and other industrial hubs in Ogun state.\n“And, I am very optimistic that, at completion, this Atan-Lusada-Agbara Road will not only improve Ease of Doing Business in this area, but bring a wholesome development to the entire Ogun West District,”Abiodun stated.\nSenator Aliero assured the state government that the committee would ensure that the reconstruction of Atan-Lusada-Agbara road is included in the 2022 Appropriation Bill.\nThe Senator noted that the Abiodun-led government had thought it wise to reconstruct the Federal Government road because of concern for the people.\nHe described the initiative as a symbol of good governance which must be appreciated, urging the governor to ask for reimbursement from the Federal Government upon completion of the project.\n“This road is a Federal Government road, because of concern you have for your people you decided to embark on the reconstruction of the road because of its economic value, not only to the state, but to the country. This is what good governance is all about.\n“I want to urge you to ask for reimbursement from the Federal Government upon the completion of this project. This project is much more important to Ogun State and by extension Nigeria. I appreciate you for this initiative; it is a right step in the right for the benefit of the country.\n“We’ll give the necessary support to ensure that this project is included in the 2022 budget”, Aliero stated.\nAdebayo lauded the governor for taking the bold step to rehabilitate the industrial road, assuring that his ministry would continue to collaborate with the state in the areas of trade and investment.\nSenator Olamilekan Adeola and former senator who represented Ogun West, Akin Odunsi, expressed their delight at the decision to reconstruct the road after years of abandonment.","1":"https://thenationonlineng.net/ota-agbara-axis-finally-the-goose-that-lays-the-golden-egg-gets-attention/","2":"2553","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999923706"},{"0":"Ayade pays December salary\nIt’s early Christmas for civil servants in Cross River State as Governor Ben Ayade paid December salary yesterday.\nGovernor Ayade at a retreat for political appointees at the Obudu Ranch Resort gave a hint that the December salary would be paid on the first day of the month.

Mr Iguniewei, 37, claimed he reached that conclusion based on both his six-year work with the Defence Industries Corporation (DIC) and his apparently unsolicited private but brief investigation into the collapsed building. Until Iguniewei testified about the probable use of this esoteric weapon, it was not clear how many Nigerians, even in the scientific community, had heard of infrasonic radiation or its use as a weapon.\nNow, whether the coroner likes it or not, he will have to contend with this mystifying theory of low intensity sound, hitherto the preserve of science fiction. Postulating confidently before the coroner, Mr Iguniewei said that after studying the damage done to the building, whose foundation pillars were still standing, he had eliminated all other possibilities and concluded that the collapsed Synagogue guest house was fired at by an infrasonic weapon, either from a flying object, presumably the aircraft Synagogue officials claimed hovered over or circled the building, or from stationary location on the ground of indeterminate distance. Infrasound or anything infrasonic, whether of weapon — which are still being researched into or are already in very limited use — or of device, refers to anything that generates low-frequency sound (lower than 20 Hertz) for a variety of purposes.\nMr Iguniewei reminds us, naturally, that infrasound cannot be seen or heard, and is different from acoustic or ultrasound. But he also obliquely suggests that weapons are always being produced and the producers are always looking for ways and where to test these weapons. But he is careful to hedge his assertions. Said he: “It is important for this court (the coroner) to be aware of this option (his explanation of the Synagogue building collapse), but why it could have been used here is another matter entirely.” In other words if the motives for the use of infrasound weapon cannot be substantiated, it is no longer the concern of Mr Iguniewei, nor does that fact vitiate his theory. Phew! He does not need to remind us that even before the last rubble fell on the collapsed pile, Synangogue officials had suggested that the collapse was probably the handiwork of terrorists who had threatened to hit the church, perhaps a vague reference to Boko Haram.\nIt is remarkable how a rather easy matter to deal with, such as investigating the reasons for the building collapse and the unnatural deaths of tourists, should elicit the kind of confusion and complexities that have enveloped it. Leader of the Synagogue church himself has pointedly refused to appear before the coroner, for it is almost certain he will be embarrassed once he is put on the witness stand. And for a tragedy that involves the death of about 115 people, most of them South Africans, it is curious how Nigeria, in the name of due process, is allowing legal and bureaucratic fog to confuse everyone and diminish the impact of the lives lost. Worse, now we are being entertained by highfalutin theories of exotic James Bond weapons, the kind that the United States would have liked to use, if it had them, on ISIS buildings in Raqqa, Mosul, Sanjar and elsewhere in Syria and Iraq.\nBut assuming such a weapon as described by the highly imaginative researcher, Mr Iguniewei, existed in Nigeria, why of all places would the authorities, in a government that courts religious groups madly, want to deploy it against the Synagogue Church of All Nations? Mr Iguniewei refuses to be drawn into that quicksand. He has thrown us a hard bone; he leaves us to determine whether our dentition can cope. Perhaps in coming to his conclusions, the smart Chief Magistrate Komolafe will doubtless put the evidence together and weigh them against all possible motives. He will also determine whether Nigeria possesses a craft that can deliver the esoteric infrasound weapon referred to by Mr Iguniewei. If his answer is yes, let him praise Mr Iguniewei for helping the coroner to come to an astounding decision. But if his answer is no, let him reserve very harsh words for the weapons researcher, who for one frightful moment, nearly made the militarily more powerful and developed industrialised West green with envy.","1":"http://thenationonlineng.net/new/infrasonic-language-lagos-coroners-inquest/","2":"968","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999904633"},{"0":"By Harris-Okon Emmanuel\nUYO- Akwa Ibom State Government has cleared the air on its award of contracts, saying that the processes are in tandem with the international best practices.\nCommissioner for Information and Strategy, Charles Udoh, made the disclosure against the backdrop of allegations that the state government contract award was shrouded in secrecy and not through competitive bidding.\nUdoh said: ‘’our award of contract follows due diligence, due process and international best practices. That is why we have a Special Adviser on Due Process and that tells you how serious this government takes the issue of transparency. We also have a Special Adviser on Direct Foreign Investment and we publish our annual report detailing how much we spend on a given project and that is a pointer to the fact that this government is transparent and accountable.\n‘’There is no one way in awarding contracts. The most important thing in awarding contract is that you follow international best practices.’’\nOn why the state government does not publicize the contract sum, the Commissioner said: ‘’There are no standard costs because construction of roads varies from size to size. The road you construct in Mbo cannot be the same amount with the one you construct in Uyo because of their peculiar terrain.\n‘’The annual report is a clear indicator how we spend Akwa Ibom money. There is no hidden agenda. And how many states in Nigeria publicize theirs? So, Akwa Ibom is very transparent and this is why we publish our annual report with audited financial statements for every year.’’\nUdoh maintained that the roads constructed by the government were built to international standard and specification even as he allegedly accused the federal government of not building a single road in the state despite the fact that the state produces the highest oil quantum to the nation coffers.\nThe Commissioner affirmed that the state government takes into consideration the economic value when building roads.\n‘’The governor is transforming the state in a sustainable manner beyond political line. And without blowing our own trumpet, Governor Udom Emmanuel is celebrated outside the state and Nigeria. The federal government found him fit to be given an Integrity award and Akwa Ibom was only the state invested to speak at an investment in 2018 in London’’, he said.\nHe, however appealed to the federal government to step up work on the portion of Itu-Calabar ravaged by gully erosion, otherwise the menace would cut off Akwa Ibom state.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"https://www.vanguardngr.com/2018/06/contracts-awards-pass-due-process-says-ibom-govt/","2":"536","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999866486"},{"0":"As strike stalls resumption of varsities\nBy Adesina Wahab\nThe Academic Staff Union of Universities, ASUU, has said it will soon expose those feeding fat on the adoption of the Integrated Personnel and Payroll Information System, IPPIS, by the Federal Government as its payment platform.\nThis is just as the union alleged that some people in the Office of the Accountant General of the Federation are subverting its efforts to reach an understanding with the Federal Government on the controversial payment system.\nThe National President of ASUU, Prof. Biodun Ogunyemi, stated this on Sunday in an interview with Vanguard.\nOgunyemi, who was reacting to a memo from the office of the AGF that any federal worker not yet captured on the IPPIS platform would not be paid salary as from November this year, noted that such a memo was not binding on his members.\n“All the agreements we have been having since 1992 with the government have always been having the provision that circulars emanating from the civil service which don’t have origin in collective bargaining with the government won’t be binding on us.\n“Circulars that will be binding on us are those coming out of our negotiation with the government like what we had in autonomy for university, retirement age and others. They can be respected because they are products of collective bargaining,” he said.\nOn why the union would not accept IPPIS, the ASUU boss explained that there was a meeting with the government where it was agreed that if ASUU could develop a better alternative to IPPIS, such an alternative would be adopted.\n“Based on that, our members started work on the University Transparency and Accountability System, UTAS, and in the presence of the Minister, the Permanent Secretary and the leadership of the National Universities Commission, NUC, we demonstrated its use.\n“IPPIS was not part of the reasons we went on strike early March this year. Now, it is clear that some elements who are benefiting from it and who do not want a better platform, brought IPPIS matter up and we are going to expose them soon. Now, our members are being owed between three and eight months salaries. We know some people deliberately withheld the salaries. Nigerians should ask them why they are doing that,” he stated.\nMeanwhile, feelers from federal universities in some parts of the country indicate that government’s directive that schools should start resuming from Monday, October 12, may not hold water.\nThis is because the ongoing strike by ASUU and the 14 days warning strike by the Senior Staff Association of Nigerian Universities, SSANU, and the Non-Academic Staff Union. NASU, may stall that.Ogunyemi, while commenting on the development, urged Nigerians to understand what his union is fighting for.\n“I have two children in public universities and so I am affected too. However, what we want is that our children should have access to sound and quality education. We don’t want what has been done to public primary and secondary schools to happen to our universities. Our products must be able to compete favourably in the global market,” he said.\nEven when universities eventually resume, some may scrap one academic session.\nFor instance, first year students of the University of Ibadan admitted for the 2019/2020 session are yet to begin classes before schools were closed due to the outbreak of Coronavirus disease in the country.\nThose to be admitted for 2020/2021 session are waiting in the wings for their admission.\nIn a related development, some Federal Polytechnics may open soon but strike notice by teaching and non-teaching staff may later be a hindrance.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"https://www.vanguardngr.com/2020/10/we-will-soon-expose-those-feeding-fat-on-ippis-says-ASUU/","2":"795","3":"Education","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999866486"},{"0":"The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said on Thursday it has become aware of products being sold online that fraudulently claim to prevent or treat Ebola.\nThe FDA’s warning comes on the heels of comments by Nigeria’s top health official, Onyebuchi Chukwu, who reportedly said earlier Thursday that eight Ebola patients in Lagos will receive an experimental treatment called nano-silver.\nErica Jefferson, a spokeswoman for the FDA, said she could not provide any information about the product referenced by the Nigerians.\nThe FDA did not specify any products in its warning.\nSilver has been used as an antibacterial for centuries.

direct primaries\nBy Simon Ebegbulem, Abuja\nThe primaries of the All Progressives Congress (APC) may have come and gone but several positives to cherish in the Comrade Adams Oshiomhole-led National Working Committee (NWC) of the party. For the first time in the history of the party, even governors and leaders, who had called the shots over the years, were panicking with the mode of primaries adopted by the NWC.\nThe NWC had canvassed for direct primaries across board but that pitched the APC National Chairman against some governors who saw that as an attempt to stop them from imposing their preferred candidates as governors and National Assembly members.\nThe governors kicked and even plotted to get some non- NWC members to pass a vote of no confidence on the NWC, but the plot failed after President Muhammadu Buhari, who is the leader of the party, backed Oshiomhole’s direct primaries mode and other reforms embarked upon by the party leadership. Oshiomhole insisted on direct primaries to ensure that the party is returned to the people after the former NWC, led by Chief John Odigie-Oyegun, handed over the party to governors.\nThat action polarized the party in almost all the states where the governors battled members of the National Assembly or the governors moved against their god fathers. Oshiomhole inherited a divided party but he promised to take up the challenge which he has done so far.\nAs a matter of fact, Senator Shehu Sani pointed out, in an interview, that Oshiomhole inherited a time bomb as a party and could explode at any time. And as predicted, members started defecting shortly after Oshiomhole assumed office in June 2018. Party leaders, such as Senate President Bukola Saraki and the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Yakubu Dogara, left the party. And if not for the frantic efforts made by Oshiomhole on assumption of office to persuade aggrieved party members to remain in the party while he looked into their complaints, Saraki would have left with about 30 APC senators.\nDue to what the party experienced in the hands of some of these politicians, Oshiomhole vowed to ensure that his NWC will use the primaries of the APC to correct the wrongs of the past. While inaugurating members of the National Assembly Primaries Committee, the party Chair had said: “With what has happened to us recently, people used our platform to rise to certain positions such as the Senate presidency and, due to their personal ambition, they betrayed the party. That will never happen again.\nWe will now ensure that we don’t give out tickets to bread and butter politicians or politicians who are not loyal to the party but only loyal to their personal ambitions. Nobody will get APC ticket by accident any more, we will ensure that whoever is given our ticket merited it and must have worked for it and he or she is prepared for the job ahead”.\nAnd after victories in both the Ekiti and Osun governorship elections, which have made the South-West a complete enclave of the APC, Oshiomhole vowed to ensure that the party is rebranded in a manner that it will again be embraced by all Nigerians. The direct primary mode was tested in Bauchi senatorial bye election and it worked. It was successful also in Osun,. Consequently, Buhari and Oshiomhole believed it was the way to go.\nThe APC then conducted direct primaries in 20 states and the FCT to choose its candidates for the 2019 polls while indirect primaries were conducted in 18 states. Understandably, some of the governors were not comfortable with the decision to adopt the direct primaries mode. But Oshiomhole pushed, stressing the need to allow the people vote candidates of their choice. The governors preferred indirect primaries to enable them put candidates of their choice but Oshiomhole insisted that that system is making the party far from the people.\nBesides, he needed to protect the National Assembly members who are at war with their governors. What actually played out in the just concluded APC primaries was that while Oshiomhole made efforts to protect the APC-led Federal Government under Buhari from the Saraki-led Senate and Dogara-led House of Representatives by ensuring that majority of the APC senators who are popular in their areas are returned, the governors wanted to protect their personal interests.\nThe situation led to the rancorous primaries held in Imo, Ogun and Zamfara states. It was difficult in states where governors are completing their second term but nursing ambitions to go to the Senate. It is even more complicated when governors are deposing sitting senators which is not in tandem with the promise made by Oshiomhole to protect the senators who stood behind the party in the battle with Saraki. Oshiomhole held several meetings with the concerned governors to allow senators return, fearing that refusing them ticket will give the Senate President more leverage to continue to frustrate the laudable programmes of the Buhari administration.\nHowever, despite the shortcomings in some states, the direct primary mode can be said to have succeeded to a large extent. For the first time, majority of the members of the party came out in large numbers to nominate those who will represent them. The exercise has received accolades across the nation irrespective of the few skirmishes witnessed in some states. Some mischief makers have continued to organize protests in order to create the impression that the primaries were not successful. But such plots have continued to fail because majority of party faithful have continued to embrace the ongoing reforms piloted by Oshiomhole in the APC.\nThe situation is similar to how the war against corruption embarked upon by the Buhari administration is fighting back. Oshiomhole came up with several reforms which include handing over the party to the masses. This became evident during the primaries, leading to a situation where political leaders, governors lost hold of the political machinery in their states. Serving Ministers were disqualified from contesting in the primaries due to one reason or the other. For most people it is strange but those who know Oshiomhole with the way he killed the politics of god fatherism in Edo State, while he was governor, know that he pursues his aims and objectives ruthlessly without fear or favour.\nThe National Chairman had always stressed the need for political leaders in the APC to operate an all-inclusive party rather than that of isolation. His reforms has pitched him against some powerful people and they are fighting back.\nMischief makers have continued to blackmail him but their plots will always hit the rock. However, Oshiomhole has remained resilient, dogged and never to be intimidated. Despite what his adversaries are saying, direct primaries have taught leaders of the party the need to be closer to the grassroot and, according to Oshiomhole, who predicted victory for the APC come 2019, “the journey for 2019 has just begun and, while the opposition PDP is busy dishing out false information to the public and raising false alarm, we have started mobilizing our members across the nation for the 2019 elections”.\nHe added: “If you look at the way our people came out during the party primaries to vote for candidates of their choice, in a very democratic manner that is strange to PDP, you will know that 2019 is over for the PDP. I am very satisfied with the primaries but as you know nothing is perfect in life but I will say we achieved substantial success and this is the first time we as a party is adopting this mode of primaries.\nIt looked difficult initially but at the end it came out well. Some persons may not be happy but many are satisfied with the outcome. We will take this to the next step and deliver all our candidates including our President, Muhammadu Buhari and we will ensure we maintain our majority in the National Assembly”.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"https://www.vanguardngr.com/2018/10/apc-primaries-how-oshiomholes-doggedness-to-protect-buhari-in-nass-pitted-him-against-govs/","2":"1651","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.999961853"},{"0":"By PETER DURU\nIn a bid to test the potency of his newly acquired bullet proof ‘juju’, a man, Ornguga Adega, of Agbatse village in Kwande local government area of Benue State, shot his only son dead while conducting a gunshot test on the boy.\nSunday Vanguard gathered that the suspect, who was immediately apprehended by men of the Benue State Police Command, is currently facing trial at a Makurdi Chief Magistrate Court.\nAccording to the First Information Report, FIR, by the police, the suspect and father of the ten- year- old had, in August 2012, bought some charm from a native doctor with the belief that it was potent enough to prevent the penetration of bullets into his body.\nHe was said to have rubbed his ‘bullet proof’ cream on the body of his son in order to verify its efficacy and potency in line with the instructions of the native doctor from whom he bought the charm.\nAccording to the FIR, Adega fired a shot with his single barrel gun on the right leg of his son following which the bullet shattered the leg and also penetrated through to the left leg.\nThe boy was said to have bled profusely but before his shocked and devastated father could get proper medical attention for him, the little boy bled to death.\nWhen the case came up at the Makurdi Chief Magistrate Court, police prosecutor, Inspector Gabriel Egbonyi, said the accused was arrested at the process of investigating the cause of death of the young boy.\nEgbonyi further told the court that the accused confessed to committing the crime and also acknowledged responsibility for the unfortunate incident which prompted further police investigation into the matter.\nMeanwhile no plea was taken for want of jurisdiction.

Power, as they truly say, must be a crazy aphrodisiac.\n“Those who said they won’t lose sleep over the R-APC, have become sleepless in the last two weeks. The President, who has held himself in the inner sanctuary of the Presidential Villa, is all of a sudden, opening his doors to one meeting or the other all in the name of re-election.\n“Just to make the point that it is too late in the day. The train has left the station. Leopards cannot change their spots, no matter how much one tries to tame them.\n‘’We enjoin all our members to remain steadfast and resolute in defending their rights and taking the appropriate action in defence of democracy.\n“This democracy must survive on ethical grounds and not on lawlessness and exclusion. It must provide a level playing ground for all participants. Those who prevented some persons from visiting their states in the name of politics have suddenly realised that they need the services and support of those persons.\n“They are now pleading, ready to submit to all demands. That won’t work because examples have shown that political agreements are often observed in the breach.\n“This is to inform our members nation-wide that we are still maintaining our stand against the APC and no amount of carrots, intimidation, and harassment can dissuade us in our shared commitment to rescue this democracy.”\nFurther dashing hopes for reconciliation, the Chairman of the New Peoples Democratic Party, nPDP, bloc in the APC, Alhaji Kawu Baraje, vowed yesterday that members of the APC and supporters of Saraki in Kwara State have vowed not to return to the party, irrespective of the juicy dangles being offered them.\nExpressing shock at the desperation of the Presidency and the party in an interview in Ilorin, he said: “The followers of the Senate President particularly from Kwara State and across the country have already resolved to leave the APC with or without Saraki, so it is now left for the Senate President to take a decision more so that he is an experienced and seasoned politician.\n“As far as I know, there is no juicy position that can replace the kind of embarrassment, debasement, and horrifying experiences many of us have suffered and gone through in the hands of some few mischievous members of the APC, it’s quite unfortunate,” he added .\nBaraje disclosed that as far as he and his supporters and followers are concerned, they have taken a decision and they are about to reach the final stage of such a decision.\nBaraje stressed: “If the Senate President feels it is fit for him to stay back, all is well and good. But the Senate President as a leader also has his supporters and followers, and if they have decided to leave the party, I don’t know what he (Saraki) will still be doing behind.\nWhy we left — Timi Frank\nThe momentum against the APC was further echoed by Frank, a former deputy national publicity secretary of the APC who said that as many as five governors, 30 senators and more than 100 members of the House of Representatives would leave the APC.\nHe chastised the ruling party for making offers to the members of the R-APC to return.\n“In a matter of days, Nigerians will have cause to celebrate our final exit from the party of killings, poverty, and propaganda to join hands with real progressive groups in the country.\n“The same people that could not respect the agreement we had in the last three years are now begging, promising heaven and earth to our leaders. In their deception, they have failed to realize that Nigerians now know their true colours. Their much talked about integrity is a delusion, they are wolves in sheep clothing.\n“Our plan to reject them and their party is not for personal gain. It is primarily to team up with real progressive groups to rescue the country from the current handlers who rejoice when Nigerians are killed in their numbers, who value lives of cows than Nigerians and religiously persecute opposition members in the name of fighting corruption.\n“In the 2019 general elections, Nigerians have come to know that a vote for the APC will mean a vote for hardship, oppression, insecurity, and unemployment. We are teaming up to ensure an end to visionless leadership of the current APC government, and because our leaders in R-APC are men and women of honour, there is no going back in our plan to join forces in rescuing Nigeria from the incompetent APC leadership.”\nWhile calling on the leaders of R-APC not to give in to pressure, the Bayelsa-born politician warned that supporting re-election bid of President Buhari is as good as giving consent to be jailed in nearest future.\nThe mainstream APC, speaking through its spokesman, Mallam Bolaji Abdullahi in a statement yesterday, however, lampooned the PDP saying: “If PDP is not alleging wild conspiracies, they are threatening to boycott elections or announcing fake defections. What is clear with all these is that no matter how long a leopard lives, it cannot change its spots.\n“What President Muhammadu Buhari and Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, the National Chairman of our Party are doing, persuading every aggrieved member not to leave the Party, is what responsible and sensible party leaders would do. Party politics is a game of numbers. And that game is addition. If the PDP had the same presence of mind in 2015, perhaps the calamity that befell them would have been averted.”\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"https://www.vanguardngr.com/2018/07/presidency-apc-move-to-break-r-apcs-ranks/","2":"2077","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999923706"},{"0":"‘PDP defectors are failed politicians’\nBayelsa State Government on Thursday described persons dumping the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for the All Progressive Congress (APC) ahead of the December 5 governorship election in the state as tested and failed politicians.\nThe Deputy Chief of Staff, Government House, Mrs. Ebizi Brown, who expressed government’s position, said the ongoing defections of politicians would not affect the fortunes of the PDP in the election.\nShe said: “On the defection of members from the PDP, I want to say that their defections won’t make any impact.

They had threatened to shut down operations, pending when government addressed the issue of skyrocketting aviation fuel price from N700 per litre.\nThis, of course, did not endure as marketers soon returned to the old price of N700 per litre and in some cases, Between N750 and N800 per litre. The probe of the marketers by the lawmakers was contingent on the protest of the domestic carriers who felt they were being ripped off by the marketers.\nReading the resolutions of the meeting that lasted for about four hours on Monday, Gbajabiamila urged the operators to begin the process of getting their own license to import the product.\nHe said: “That we move the language of suspension to canceled. That the issues of shut down has been canceled, based on this meeting.\n“NNPC and airline operators have both agreed that in the interim of three months, marketers of choice that you are comfortable with and that you know their mark up will not drive you out of business, would be supplied with jet fuel. We talked about N550 or something like that.\n“The third resolution is that at the mid to long term, in fact right now, you will begin the process of application for your own license to be able to import your own jet fuel. To assist you in your business.\n“Also tie to the benevolence of the CBN governor that six million litres are available now at N480. You will get allocation for the next three months through the companies you have nominated.\n“In the process of application for license, midstream should as much as possible grant waivers that would not touch on the security and safety of the process. Committee chairmen on aviation and downstream should follow up.”\nEarlier in his remarks, the speaker said their intervention was necessary to stop the economy from bleeding.\n“We are at the precipice today in Nigeria. It is a crucial moment for us. There is a crisis at hand. Shut down of airline operations has the potential of shutting down this government. We cannot sit here as stakeholders and fold our arms and watch this happen. We need to address this matter once and for all,’’ he said.\nAppearing before the special committee, led by the speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila on Monday, the Vice President of AON, Mr. Allen Onyema, who is also chairman of Air Peace, however, said that they were denied the delivery of 25,000 metric tons of fuel approved by President Muhammadu Buhari which was to be sold to them at the landing cost but accused the NNPC and some marketers of ripping them off.\nConsequently, he said they were asked to nominate 10 marketers they could trust to enable them handle the transactions.\nOnyeama told the committee of how his association was invited by the Nigeria Midstream and Downstream Regulatory Authority, NMDRA, to notify them of the President’s gesture.\nHe also said that while he alerted the NNPC GMD, Mele Kyari, informing him of the President’s gesture and their selected marketers, the response he got was not friendly.\n“We were invited by the Midstream and Downstream Authority and we were told that the President approved 25,000 metric tonnes for us as a palliative to help us. We were very grateful to the president.\n‘’It was not free. We were happy. We were told to nominate marketers that would market this product for us. We were told to have a meeting with these marketers. We called all the marketers, we held meeting with them.\n‘’We decided the logistics, so they would take their logistical costs and everything and at the end of the day that fuel was getting to them, they told us at N335, so we put everything together and it would be getting to less than N400 for the cost and we said even if they sell to us at N450, it would be okay.\n“We were told that a week later that the consignment would be arriving Nigeria but the next thing we heard from the marketers was that they had already been given the consignment that we were all jostling for. So we waited, thinking that they would sell as agreed. They never did.\n“I actually called the MD of NNPC in the presence of our members. We wanted to hear from him. He answered that there was no way they would leave us to get the product directly, that it was dangerous.\n‘’But I said no, that the marketers you are going to give are the same marketers that would handle it for us. He said he did not want any crash or anybody adulterating it. I said how could they adulterate it because they are the same marketers.\n‘’We are not taking it on our own. Long and short of the story is that this product was not given to us and we noticed that it continued rising and rising,” he said.\nAlso speaking at the forum, President of the Association, Abdulmanaf Yunusa, who’s also the Chairman of Azman Air, corroborated the allegation, saying NNPC denied them the allocation approved by the president.\nBut Kyari, who put up a stout defence for the marketers, said his refusal was hinged on safety issues, stressing that releasing aviation fuel directly to operators, or even marketers was risky.\n“Mr speaker sir, it is more complex than they say. Somebody must handle aviation fuel. We cannot surrender the safety of Nigerians to just anyone. It is not every marketing company that can handle ATK, including the chairman’s company. ’We cannot give him. He has marketing company. We cannot give ATK to handle. That is why they have to bring the people that we can deal with,” he said.\nIn his presentation, NNPC GMD, Mele Kyari, said it was difficult to have a fixed price of the product, saying “we agreed that we make the marketers sell the product to them at N500 for three days pending the day they would sit down and agree on this pricing formula. ‘’I confirm that between us the and the downstream authority they had sat down and engaged and agreed on a pricing structure.\n“Needless to say there is no fixed price. This is a deregulated product. So you cannot hold unto any price and indeed what you have seen in the media is N700 reference point. It cannot be a reference point. It depends on the market condition. It can higher than N700 depending on the market. This markets shifts. As we speak it is closely related to the price of crude oil.\n“There is no way the oil matters, I am speaking for them now, if you own me N1 billion. I would not give you credit. No one would do this. There are limits to credits. It is an understanding customers\n“It is our role to ensure we intervene. We did. We brought in products so that we can dampen the price. In March and April, we brought in cargo and made it available to the entire industry at N460. there is a build up to that price. When the customer takes marine N435, he has to transport, he has to charter vessel, bring it to his depot, to his furl station and transport it. So there cannot be two same price in Lagos and Maiduguri.\n“We cannot fix price. We cannot ask for N500. we cannot say it must be below N600 or N700. That is why we insisted they go and have a formula that is transparent that each one of us can see.\n“The only way we can have fixed price is if we put subsidy on. You can say it can sell for N500 in any circumstance, then somebody has paid for that difference. I am not sure this is what we are doing.\n“There is an FX constraint. There is limit to what the CBN can provide. We are constrained because we are not able to produce dollar because of teh dearth of oil in the Nigera Delta. This is then reality. So we do not have. That means customers must source for FX from alternative sources”, he said.\nSimilarly, the CBN governor, Emefiele who responded to the an earlier concern of the operators of not accessing foreign exchange, said there was one to sell, adding that it was only when the NNPC exported products that it could get foreign exchange.\n“The availability of FX is very important and the issue of constraint from FX arising from issues bordering on theft in the Niger Delta is a big issue. It is when NNPC is able to export that dollars can come in.\n“We do not have FX to sell. It would be difficult for us to grant any concession. It means we would be taking a hit or we would be providing some sort of subsidy for the industry,” he said.\nIt will be recalled that on March 14, 2022, when the first meeting of the stakeholders held with the deputy speaker of the House, Ahmed Idris Wase, presiding, he had lashed out at the\nChief Executive, Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Regulatory Authority, NDMPRA, Ahmed Farouk represented by an Executive Director, Ogbogu Ukoha who said the prices of fuel had been discounted.\nWase had asked the regulatory body the current price of the product and why it was so exorbitant but was referred to the marketers who, however, sidestepped the questions and could not give specific answers.\nWase had said: “As far as I’m concerned, the basic issues that we left to come back today have not been addressed. First is on the agreement, your resolution, that’s is the basis to proceed on any meeting and I read out what we resolved the other day and that’s why I’m asking you the questions.\n‘’ I specifically asked the other person when he said they sell at a loss. I said what was the unit cost at that time that you were selling at loss, so we will now know. And I said here, you are just using semantics and language.\n‘’Here, I am after facts. We are on fact-finding, we are not on language here and I want to insist that please let’s be serious.\n“Like I did mention to him, the House can go further, if you want us to go on expanded investigation, we will do that. As far as I’m concerned, I am not willing to compromise what is in the interest of our own country.\n“You are supposed to regulate their (oil marketers) activities, are you just giving the licence? What are the minimum requirements; what is expected of that company that you are authorizing them to bring in this product?\n‘’ Is it that they have the opportunity and then the leverage to tell you whatever rate they want and it has to stand? No, I don’t think so”.\nIn their remarks at the meeting, the oil marketers, represented by Olumide Adeosun, thanked the House for their intervention.\n“We are grateful for your intervention. The last thing any marketer wants is to create a saturation where the general public has to pay far beyond what they can afford for any product.\n‘’The resolution that we reached today is one that is attainable and we look forward to working with our colleagues in the aviation sector so that we can have an efficient sector for Nigerians”, he said.\nHowever, the marketers were absent at Monday meeting.\nThe deputy speaker had remarked that they ought be handy to give some explanations to some issues, expressing displeasure with the GMD for speaking on their behalf.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"https://www.vanguardngr.com/2022/05/how-oil-marketersre-ripping-us-off-say-airline-operators/","2":"2871","3":"Travel","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999866486"},{"0":"The Federal Government has extended the suspension of the new electricity tariff by one week.\nProf. James Momoh, Chairman, Nigeria Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) said this when the ad hoc Technical Committee on Electricity Tariff submitted its interim report at a reconvene bilateral meeting between Federal Government and Organised Labour on Monday in Abuja.\nThe new tariff was earlier suspended for two weeks and ended at midnight on Oct. 11, when the organised labour suspended the planned industrial action over agitation on the hike in electricity tariff on Sept. 28.,\nIt would also be recalled that the the committee which was Chaired by Mr Festus Keyamo, Minister of State for Labour is to examine the justifications for the new policy in view of the need for the validation of the basis for the new cost reflective tariff.\nIt was also agreed that while the committee carries the justification that electricity tariff should be reduced for two weeks.\nMomoh while speaking, said the one week extension new tariff said was to enable the committee to review and work out modalities for the implementation of the agreement reached on the electricity tariffs structure.\nSen.

boycott of the Auchi Day celebration.\nThe event was promoted as grounds to broker a peace accord between the two influential sons of the state, with the traditional rulers acting as umpires.\nThe celebration, in its 23rd edition, was themed ‘Our salvation is in the hands of Allah’ and held at the palace of the Otaru of Auchi Kingdom, Etsako West Local Government Area of Edo State.\nWeeks before the event in Auchi, which hosted illustrious sons and daughters of the state, eminent traditional rulers, representative of the Oba of Benin, political watchers had predicted that the crisis would be resolved during the celebration as the traditional rulers would deploy their influence and wisdom in getting Governor Obaseki and Comrade Oshiomhole to settle their differences in the interest of the development of the state.\nIn the run-up to the celebration, the Oba of Benin, had announced a fast on January 6, declared by the council to seek the face of God in the lingering crisis and pray for a peaceful resolution of the conflict.\nHowever, the absence of Comrade Oshiomhole at the venue, which is few meters away from Iyamho, the APC helmsman’s hometown, punctured the spirited efforts of the traditional rulers to resolve the impasse between the two former allies.\nREAD ALSO: Edo to build Textile Mill — Obaseki\nSpeaking at the event, Governor Obaseki said he will

Edo people that his administration will never play politics of favoritism, but rather focus on developing all parts of the state equally.\nThe governor said the objective of his administration is to pursue policies and programmes that would guarantee a better life for the greatest number of people in the state, noting, “With the limited resources available to us, we have been able to renovate some primary schools and constructed road projects in the locality to improve the lives of the people.

Aminu Tambuwal promised automatic employment for all people living with HIV with an employable certificate.\nHe, however, noted that after the announcement, less than 10 persons came forward, stressing that those with certificates refused to come forward out of fear of being stigmatised.\n“I have been living with the virus since 2007, and I want to tell you that our major challenge in Sokoto is stigma, despite the domestication of the Anti-stigma Law by the state government.\n“We are still being stigmatised by community members, including some government officials. People find it difficult to identify with us or help us, out of fear that they may be seen as carriers of HIV.\n“Others do not want to even associate with us on the grounds that we will infect them with the virus. I tell you, Sokoto is a difficult place to live for people living with HIV.\n“But this is our home. We have no were else to go. We will have to deal with it and move on,” he said.\nThe coordinator advised community members and government officials against stigmatising people living with the virus, and described that trend as “unfortunate and dangerous”.\nAccording to him, the problem, if not addressed, will consume the entire state someday, warning that infected people will be forced to continue hiding their identity and embark on spreading the virus.\n“If you keep stigmatising us, we will hide our status and marry your sisters. And what do you expect when an infected widow with children is hungry and suffering from no support?\n“Of course, in the struggle for survival, she will go into prostitution and in the process spread the virus to others until it eventually gets to those who treat us with hate.”\nMohammed said that NEPWHAN had 15 support groups to share experience, increase patients’ knowledge and literacy, and serve as an intervention to address the psycho-social needs of people living with the virus.\nHe added that there were also three community support groups implementing stigma reduction programmes in communities and helping to track and counsel members that were defaulting on treatment.\nHe, however, said that due to lack of support, the groups had not been holding meetings for a very long time, a development he said was counterproductive to ensuring infected people remained in treatment.\nHe called on the state government to increase funding to the state agency for the control of AIDS and ensure timely release of the funds.\nThis, according to him, will enable the agency to help NEPWHAN to conduct support group meetings and provide home-based care services to members voluntarily.\nThe coordinator urged people living with the virus to fight self-stigmatisation and find ways to come to terms with their situation and continue treatment so as to live long and healthy lives.\nHe also advised people to know their status so that they could begin treatment if positive while urging those who tested negative to stay clear of the virus.\n“Please, we do not want more people to join us because support from international donors is dwindling and there is growing concern that this development will affect the supply of drugs, our lifeline,” he said.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"https://www.vanguardngr.com/2020/12/stigmatisation-our-greatest-challenge-in-sokoto-hiv-positive-persons/amp/?utm_source=&utm_medium=twitter&__twitter_impression=trueSissy3","2":"776","3":"Health","4":"2","5":"en","6":"0.9999828339"},{"0":"Herdsmen set Ortom’s rice farm ablaze\nOver 20,000 hectares of rice farm belonging to Benue State Governor Samuel Ortom have been set ablaze by suspected herdsmen in Tse-Adorogo, Mbabeagh, Nzorov, Guma Local Government Area.\nIn a telephone interview with The Nation, the governor said he had not harvested his rice farm, which is incorporated under Oracle Business Limited, before the suspected herdsmen set it ablaze.\nOrace Farms, which started when the governor was the Chairman of Guma Local Government Area, is into massive rice and soybeans cultivation.\nIt was learnt that this was the fourth time Ortom’s farms had been attacked.\nWhen he was Minster of State in former President Goodluck Jonathan’s administration, suspected herdsmen attacked his Oracle Farm on Naka Road at gunpoint and stole 30 cows.\nThe herdsmen struck again in 2014 at his Tse- Adorogo, Mbabeagh country home and set his rice farm and house ablaze.\nWhen he became governor in 2015, herdsmen again set ablaze his rice farm in 2016 and 2017.\nThe governor expressed concern that herdsmen again destroyed crops in the state.\nHe reiterated his called for ranching of animals, saying there is no more land for anyone to feed their cattle in the name of grazing.\n“I said ranching is the international best practice for animal husbandry.

Abdulrahman Dambazau (retd) stated this on a Sunday midnight television programme “Question Time” on Channels TV.\n“We must protect the country which is the main function of the police. The Civil Defence are there to complement them too.\n“This is a non-military issue that borders on law and order. It is not every security issue that you call in the military. It is the responsibility of the police to maintain peace. I believe that if we put the police in proper position in terms of discharging its functions, then there would be no need for military option. The police are equal to the task. If you have to deploy the army, then you are going above board (sic). In any case, I do not even have the power to deploy the military for anything.

How we go about doing that is another thing. Outside the country, for instance in the United Kingdom UK, they rely on ‘Prisons Labour’ to do that and it is from prisons labour they do that to recoup their investment.\n“Here, 70 per cent of our inmates are awaiting trial and by international law, you cannot engage inmates who are awaiting trial in such labour, but it is still something that we can sit down with those who are interested”, he said.\n‘FG not spending N14, 000 prisoners’\nThe minister however dismissed reports that government was spending N14, 000 to feed each prisoner on a daily basis, but said Nigeria currently spends about N10.6 billion feeding over 65, 000 prisoners yearly.\n“It is not sustainable given that we have about 65, 000 to 70,000 prisoners. If you have 65, 000 prisoners, the feeding that was approved by former President Jonathan, you raised the feeding to N450 per day including gas; if you multiply it by 65, 000 prisoners in 365 days, you get roughly N10.6 billion.

This the CP denied.\nIrked by Mbu’s defence, Amaechi, through his information commissioner, said in Port Harcourt yesterday that the excuse now given by Mr. Mbu was not “the reason given, when both the Escort Commander and the Camp Commandant were invited to the Police Headquarters (in Port Harcourt).\n“This excuse was also not offered when the governor personally called Mr. Mbu to complain about the removal of his escort commander.\n“Matters of personal security of government functionaries and especially top officials like the governor of the state are discussed and agreed with these officials.\n“Even if for the purpose of argument, it is indeed factual that the IGP ordered the redeployment of Governor Amaechi’s Escort Commander, wouldn’t the courteous thing be for the Commissioner of Police and the police high command to inform and explain this to Governor Amaechi?\n“On matters of his personal security, a governor reserves the right to reject or accept security details, as he may be comfortable with.

It also alleged that the CAN leadership bought official vehicles at questionable prices.\nThe CAN President, Rev. (Dr) Samson Olasupo Ayokunle, dismissed the allegations, branding them as “a catalogue of lies” designed to smear his reputation.\nIn a memo, titled ‘NCEF Protests: Is NEC of CAN Guilty of Negligence?’, and signed by the Chairman, Elder Solomon Asemota, SAN, on behalf of members, including, but not limited to retired Generals Joshua Dogonyaro, Zamani Lekwot, Theophilus Yakubu Danjuma; Elder Matthew Owojaiye, Justice Kalajine Anigbogu (ret.), Elder Shyngle Wigwe, Dr. Chukwuemeka Ezeife, Pastor Bosun Emmanuel (Secretary), NCEF is calling on the National Executive Council, NEC, to investigate alleged high handedness of the CAN President.\nAccording to the memo, NEC should immediately convene an emergency meeting to consider the issues raised and set up the process for the investigation of Ayokunle and immediate suspension of the President of CAN, until all these allegations have been investigated and he is cleared of wrong doing.\nContinuing, the memo urged the NEC to ensure that the investigation looks into the activities of other officials of CAN on whose heads allegations of wrong doing and misconduct hang.\nThe Christian Elders argued that it has the statutory right to “make its position public to all Nigerian Christians and alert them that, if Christianity is destroyed in Nigeria or Christians continue to get slaughtered, the present NEC of CAN should be held responsible.\nNCEF began its memo by expressing its condolence to CAN and all Christians in Nigeria on the death of Dr. Musa Asake, CAN Secretary General, on Friday, May 11, 2018.\nThe memo went on to level the allegations against the CAN to include corruption, high handedness and abuse of office. It alleged that a vehicle that was purportedly purchased for the use of the CAN Vice President at a cost of N11 million in Cotonou was being sold in Nigeria at N5 million. Dr. Ayokunle is yet to explain what happened to N6 million. In all, N43 million was spent to purchase four second hand vehicles in Cotonou. This allegation is too big to be swept under the carpet. (This vehicle is parked at the National Christian Centre, Abuja),”the Christian Elders said.\nThey went on: “On the 10th of November, 2017, a delegation of CAN, led by the President of CAN, Rev. Dr. Ayokunle, met with President Muhammadu Buhari and, after the visit, collected ‘transportation’ money. While informed sources claim it was N40 million, CAN officials insist it was N25 million and it was alleged to have been shared by somebody who is not an official of the National Secretariat of CAN.\n“NCEF insists on proper investigation of how the money was shared and how much each person received. In addition, NCEF insists on proper sanction of every Christian leader that took part in sharing money from President Buhari. It is unethical and very insensitive for Christian leaders to collect money from the man every Christian is aware has compromised security to the detriment of the Church”.\nSaying the auditor presented a financial report to CAN that did not include the N43 million spent on vehicles in Cotonou, the memo said: “Where did N43 million disappear to?”. The group pointed out that NEC was yet to properly investigate how N28 million the former President of CAN provided before he left office, to minister to persecuted Christians, was spent”.\nContinuing, the Christian Elders said various alleged infractions on the constitution of CAN, as listed by the Vice President of CAN, had to be investigated including the Report of the Mediating Committee, headed by Supreme Court Justice, Hon. Justice James Ogebe.\nAccording to the memo, the attempt to use the Assistant General Secretary as scapegoat for the transactions in Cotonou has to be properly investigated and all those involved disciplined.\nThe group also said “the letter to DSS which Rev. Dr. Ayokunle refused to sign on 28th February, 2017, after he had agreed he would do so on 15th February, 2017, has to be investigated. It asked: “Why did he, as the President of CAN and as the Chairman of the CAN Trust Fund, refuse to append his signature to the letter? “Second, who gave the authority to edit the letter and remove substantial sections of it before the Legal Adviser eventually signed and sent a diluted document to the DSS?”\nThe Elders said CAN NEC was yet to investigate the tribal shift in appointments in the national offices and in the secretariat.\nReacting to the allegations, Ayokunle, who was attending a conference in Philadephia, United States, at the weekend, advised Sunday Vanguard to discountenance the charges as a “catalogue of lies.”\n“There is no truth in what they are alleging. No truth at all in all the allegations. If they are after sanity in CAN, is it on the pages of newspaper that they intend to settle any dispute? Do Muslims behave like that about their leaders?”, the CAN leader said on phone.\n“You know if these people are allowed to smear my reputation on the pages of the media, they have successfully finished the Church in Nigeria. They have already written that I should be removed because they did a kangaroo investigation which did not involve me.”\nWhile appealing for restraint, Ayokunle said representatives from both parties to the conflict must allow the NEC of CAN to handle all perceived grievances amicably “because when you have done the damage, it will be difficult to correct.”\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"https://www.google.com.ng/amp/s/www.vanguardngr.com/2018/05/trouble-in-the-house-of-god-buharis-cash-gift-divides-can/amp/","2":"1332","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999675751"},{"0":"Police arrest seven over assassination attempt on Melaye\nThe Kogi State Police Command on Monday said seven persons have been arrested in connection with the assassination attempt on Senator Dino Melaye at his country home Aiyetoro-Gbede last Saturday.\nMelaye escaped unhurt after gunmen invaded his house and shot sporadically.

Based on gross domestic product at the end of 2015 published by the International Monetary Fund, the size of South Africa’s economy is $301 billion at the rand’s current exchange rate, while Nigeria’s GDP is $296 billion.\nThat’s after the rand gained more than 16 percent against the dollar since the start of 2016, and Nigeria’s naira lost more than a third of its value after the central bank removed a currency peg in June.\nBoth nations face the risk of a recession after contracting in the first quarter of the year.\nThe Nigerian economy shrank by 0.4 percent in the three months through March from a year earlier amid low oil prices and output and shortage of foreign currency.\nThat curbed imports, including fuel. In South Africa, GDP contracted by 0.2 percent from a year earlier as farming and mining output declined.\n“More than the growth outlook, in the short term the ranking of these economies is likely to be determined by exchange rate movements,” Alan Cameron, an economist at Exotix Partners LLP, said. Although Nigeria is unlikely to be unseated as Africa’s largest economy in the long run, “the momentum that took it there in the first place is now long gone.”\nThe South African rand rallied as investors turned to emerging markets with liquid capital markets to seek returns after Britain voted to leave the European Union on June 23, even as the central bank forecast the economy won’t expand this year and the nation risks losing its investment-grade credit rating.\nThe ruling African National Congress’s lowest support since 1994 in the August 3 local government vote led to further gains on speculation that it will pressure the party to introduce economic reforms that will boost growth and cut unemployment.\nIn Nigeria, investors did not flock to buy naira-based assets after authorities removed the peg of 197-199 naira per dollar. The Central Bank of Nigeria raised its benchmark interest rate to a record in July to lure foreign money, even as the IMF forecast the economy will contract 1.8 percent this year.\nNigeria was assessed as the continent’s largest economy in April 2014 when authorities overhauled its GDP data for the first time in two decades. The recalculation saw the Nigerian economy in 2013 expand by three-quarters to an estimated N80 trillion. The rand gained 1 percent to 13.2805 per dollar at 4:03 p.m. in Johannesburg on Wednesday.

Ibrahim Babangida\nBy Emmanuel Aziken\nFormer President Ibrahim Babangida has flayed what he Wednesday described as an attempt to ridicule the military institution and some of its sterling lights in the name of politics.\nTaking note of a television documentary aired on Tuesday night on a private television network to project President Goodluck Jonathan ahead of the presidential election, Babangida lamented that the president’s backers at the same time poured calumny on some of the country’s former military rulers.\nBabangida took strong objections to what he said were the negative imputations put on the integrity and services to the nation by Generals Olusegun Obasanjo, Muhammadu Buhari, himself; Ibrahim Babangida, late Sani Abacha, Abdulsalami Abubakar, and T.Y Danjuma.\nNoting that the sponsors of the documentary which he described as a hate campaign were either intellectually delinquent or suffering from memory loss; or a combination of both, Babangida referred them to his leading role in the formation of the People’s Democratic Party, PDP.\n“For record purposes, and without sounding immodest, the idea of a PDP that has now become the “largest party in Africa” started in my home, here in Minna. With the support of my fellow colleagues, we prepared the way for this democratic process that has now led us to where we are presently. We built the democratic infrastructure and architecture. Those who are parading themselves as democrats today, all participated in military governments. As a deliberate principle of remaining unsung, or blowing my own trumpet, I have elected over the years to maintain dignified silence on so many issues concerning Nigeria while I cultivate my access to each sitting President to pass across my advice in whatever form.\n“It is on record and this is incontrovertible that the government I ran paraded some of the best brains this country can be proud of. I still remain eternally grateful to those wonderful brains who participated in our government to fashion a new roadmap for re-engineering the country. Some of our policies have remained unsurpassed till date and most of what the country enjoys today was a creation of the Military.\nFrom primary healthcare to good roads, DFRRI, Better Life for Rural Women, housing, river basin authorities, MAMSER, new airports, agricultural development and other economic infrastructure, to mention but a few, were platforms where our interventions were felt. We achieved that much with very slim resources. If we had the several billions of dollars that are flying around today, we would have turned Nigeria to the Dubai of Africa.\n“The military is an institution that is so dear to my heart. It is an institution that nurtured my growing up and my achievements in life. I am not only sold to the military institution and by extension the Nigerian state, I am betrothed to it. As a profession, retirees are bound to participate in politics and democracy as an all-inclusive process, same way that Doctors, Lawyers, Teachers, Nurses, and Civil Servants get involved in it.\nIt is the reason why I ventured into politics in 2003 before I quit in 2010. It is the same reason why General Obasanjo participated and got elected; and now General Buhari. It is therefore very curious that promoters of President Goodluck Jonathan’s aspiration would attempt to demonize and stigmatize former military leaders and cast aspersions on them in order to malign their reputation. This is very unfair.\n“Fact is; the military fought a civil war to keep this country together. What I suffer today is a consequence of the injuries I sustained during the Nigeria Civil War. I am not sure there is any patriotism that is more than that. Some of us were prepared to die for the country. The military is presently combating the dreaded Boko Haram sect to restore Nigeria’s territorial integrity. What law under a democracy forbids retired military personnel from participating in politics and presenting themselves for election? Over 90 percent of American Presidents have military background.\nLeadership training is better grounded in the military than any other profession. And the military parades some of the best brains in any country, including Nigeria. In fact, some of my military students that I tutored have Doctorate Degrees. It is therefore callous, wicked, out-of-sync, cynical and a show of crass ignorance for anyone to undermine the military institution by embarking on mudslinging campaigns against former presidents and leaders of military background.\n“While those campaigners are pointing their accusing fingers at us, they forget to recall that the present Director-General of the PDP Presidential Campaign Organization is actually a retired Military Officer. It is this form of demonization and stigmatization that often compels us to exhibit espirit de corps amongst ourselves in support of our military institution and colleagues when the stakes are high. As disciplined military officers, we are patriotic Nigerians and must be treated with utmost respect and decorum.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"http://www.vanguardngr.com/2015/03/babangida-fumes-at-anti-military-political-broadcast/#sthash.bZNlIIrv.dpuf","2":"1056","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9996338487"},{"0":"Medics in full gear to avoid contracting the virus\n.No Nigerian infected\n.Nigerians should stop eating bats\n.Domestic animals not carrier of the virus\nBy Chioma Obinna, Olasunkanmi Akoni, Lawani Mikairu & Daniel Eteghe\nThe Lagos State Government disclosed, yesterday, that the Nigerian Ambassador to Liberia, Chigozie Obi Nnadozie, three staff of the Economic Community of West African States, ECOWAS, and 55 others had contact with the victim of Ebola Virus Disease, EVD, Patrick Sawyer, who died in Lagos, last Thursday.\nThe Joint Federal and State Team in collaboration with other health organisations on prevention of Ebola outbreak in Lagos, has begun monitoring of the 59 persons that had contact with the victim, who died of Ebola Virus Disease, EVD, in a private hospital in Lagos, last week.\nAddressing a joint press briefing, yesterday, on the update of the Ebola virus disease, Director National Centre for Disease Control, NCDC, Professor Abdulsalim Nasidi, and Lagos State Commissioner for Health, Dr. Jide Idris, explained that out of the 59 persons that had contact with the Sawyer in Lagos, 44 were hospital contacts (38 healthcare workers and six laboratory staff) and 15 airport contacts comprising three ECOWAS staff – driver, liaison and protocol officer, Nigerian Ambassador to Monrovia, two nursing staff and five airport passenger handlers.\nAppeal for calm\nIdris, who appealed for calm, said right now, 20 contacts had been physically screened. “The airline manifest has not been provided by the airline at the time of this report and therefore, the precise number of passenger contacts is yet to be ascertained, especially as two flights were involved Monrovia – Lome and Lome – Lagos. There was no report of medical incident filed and the General Declaration report of the flight.”\nIdris who stated categorically that only one case of imported Ebola and one death has been recorded in Lagos, said: “No Nigerian is infected, but all contacts are being actively followed. We call on all Nigerians to be calm and not panic and I do hereby assure them that both the state and Federal governments are up in arms to ensure that the virus did not escape and that no Nigeria is infected with this virus,” he stressed.\nIt was further disclosed that preliminary laboratory investigation conducted by the NCDC AI virology laboratory of the Lagos University Teaching Hospital, LASUTH, and the Redeemers’ University’s World-Bank Funded African Centre of Excellence for Genomics of Infectious Diseases (ACEGID) detected viral DNA and in both blood and urine samples obtained from the patient were positive for the Pan Filo virus analysis and Ebola Zaire MGB virus strain – specific analysis. Samples were also collected for further confirmation at the WHO, collaborating laboratory for Ebola in Dakar.\nMeanwhile, an isolation ward has been designated by the Lagos State Ministry of Health at the Infectious Disease Hospital, Yaba for case management. The designation of three other health facilities was said to be under way.\nIdris explained that adhering strictly to WHO guidelines, the body of the deceased patient was decontaminated using 10 per cent sodium hypochlorite and cremated, with the permission of the government of Liberia. “A cremation report has been prepared for dispatch to the family. The vehicle that conveyed the remains was also fully decontaminated.”\nNasidi, who allayed fears that EVD cannot be acquired through mere coming into contact with the EVD patient, disclosed that effort to send the packaged sample of the decease to Dakar failed as the courier company turned it down.\n“We were disappointed that the courier rejected the sample. That is why we immediately sought the second opinion of World Health Organisation, WHO, recommended laboratory which is International Centre for Genomics. We are still going to dispatch it to Dakar, most likely first thing today but the WHO has accepted this result.”\nNasidi explained further that even dead bodies of EVD could be more dangerous in terms of transmission.\nTo ensure appropriate case management and infection prevention and control, he explained that an isolation ward has been designated by the Lagos State Ministry of Health at the Infectious Disease Hospital, Yaba for case management, adding that the designation of three other health facilities is under way.\nFurther, he disclosed that a total of 100 Personal Protective Equipment, PPEs, have been procured by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control, NCDC, and Federal Ministry of Health, FMOH and distributed to the private hospital and the state Ministry of Health and WHO also donated 250 PPEs to the NCDC/FMOH.\nOn how the corpse was decomposed, the Commissioner said the state adhered strictly to WHO guidelines, the body of the deceased patient was de-contaminated, using 10 per cent sodium hypochlorite and cremated, with the permission of the government of Liberia. “A cremation report has been prepared for dispatch to the family. The vehicle that conveyed the remains was also fully decontaminated,” he added.\nRecognising the importance of involving the community early in the response, he stated that already the various communities, traditional and religious leaders have been alerted about the disease and urged to report promptly to healthcare workers of any suspected case.\nCategories of EVD\nExplaining categories of Ebola Virus Disease, EVD, spread, he explained that “those who come in direct contact of excretions of the dead are primary high risk group; the second group are those that come in contact with facilities used to actually treat or handle these patients; the third category are those who come in contact with those who came in very closed contact with the victim or the dead body. However, the fourth category is those who are within the areas of active transmission of the virus.\n“It is also important we clarify a question of whether any of the contacts has been tested – the two laboratories are on standby for 24 hours and we have the APIN and the laboratory committee on the group screening one on one, and taking temperature of the contacts twice a day – morning and evening. We are following WHO criteria and the special protocol that you screen only the blood of only those contacts that start developing symptoms. We are going to identify few of them that we’d already known that came directly in contact with the blood of the deceased while managing him,” he added.\nWarning communities that eat bats, he said this is the time for them to desist from consuming it. Similarly, he noted that some communities that worship bats and keep them in their houses should be very careful and stop the act.\nOn burial ceremonies of people who died from EVD, he said it had been shown that 40 per cent of the cases of Ebola virus spread was from the mishandling of the burial of the dead bodies. He warned that in case of any Ebola death, people should not just go and bury but contact public health officials.\nPresident of the Nigerian Academy of Science, Professor Oyewale Tomori, who commended the state government for its prompt response, harped on the rules of hand washing and infection control. “There is no need for panic if we follow the rules of hand washing and infection control. There is need for Nigerians to be at alert as it is happening within the West African countries. There is absolutely no need to panic, he insisted.\n“Where it has spread, it is because people have abandoned the rules of hand washing and infection control; we shouldn’t have diseases like Ebola if we maintain the rules of hand washing. Where people have followed the rules of hand washing, we must be at alert; we are not out of the wood yet. We must continue to be at alert. We need to be washing our hands but no reason to panic.” He explained that domestic animals are not carriers of Ebola virus and people who are rearing domestic animals such as pig should not be afraid.\nAlso speaking, the Special Adviser to the Governor on Public Health, Dr. Yewande Adeshina urged residents and health officials in the state to report any suspected case of Ebola virus immediately. Adeshina appealed to residents to reduce the risk of contracting the disease by observing high standard of hygiene through washing of hands often with soap and water.\n“Avoid close contact with anyone who is sick and ensure that objects used by the sick are decontaminated and properly disposed because fluids from an infected person are extremely dangerous,” Adeshina urged residents.\nNCAA suspends A_SKY Airline operations to Nigeria\nMeanwhile, the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority, NCAA, yesterday, said it has suspended all A_SKY Airline operations to Nigeria with immediate effect.

This go-to documentation kit covers the following:\n- What threats and situations must be considered security incidents, and what staff must do when they happen\n- Who is responsible for performing certain tasks in case of a security incident, and how employees can reach them\n- When specific tasks must be performed by the staff\n- How exactly staff must complete those particular tasks\nWhy do you need an incident response plan?\nWhat are the key cyber incident response steps?\n- Preparation. Create an exhaustive list of all your assets and endpoints with a defined importance score. Ensure you have monitoring tools in place to understand your normal activity, assess behavior patterns, and collect other metrics to see when something unusual happens. Decide what security events should be blocked and investigated immediately.\n- Detection and incident analysis. It all starts with collecting data from all your existing security tools, IT systems, public resources, and more. Then goes the analysis stage, where the normal and current activity of the affected system is assessed. Security specialists need to correlate related events and understand how they differ. It may be the most complicated and time-consuming step because it requires constant switching between contexts and interfaces and manual correlation and analysis.\nWith UnderDefense MAXI, you can make this process easy and fast. The platform provides all the key features and capabilities for smooth and effective monitoring, risk detection, and analysis of security incidents. - Containment, eradication, and recovery. Blocking a threat before it incurs losses is one of the most important goals of incident response managed services. The containment procedure will vary depending on the severity, potential damage level, the need for vital systems' availability, and more. During the next stages, eradication and recovery, you may need to clean the environment, remove all incident elements, restore systems, or reset account details depending on the type of attack and affected assets.\n- Post-incident. Use the lessons learned to improve your security processes, IR plan, and corporate policies and procedures after each incident.\nWhat is the key to effective incident response?\nThings to check out\nGo backAll TopicsWritten A good point I’m generously going to throw at you now is that security...\nAre you sure your SOC is invincible armor?

The good news is that some Nigerians are getting better, wiser and sober when choosing and rejecting politicians. We expect more sophisticated voters for the next Gubernatorial Election. While it is true that too many still vote on selfish, emotional and ethnic attachments; we are witnessing a class of voters voting beyond stomach infrastructure.\nWe are now realizing that the hands of politicians are the wrong place to put all our trust and destiny just because they choose enemies for us. These godfathers are the real enemies we need to disgrace. Presidential Election is done, vote regardless of Party Affiliations and for the candidates that will implement the interest of your state.\nDivided States votes reflects sophistication and principle beyond primordial instincts. Ironically, most of those that are godfathers today rejected their own godfathers after getting the Golden Fleeces. Saraki rejected his own father as political godfather, Tinubu sent Pa Dawodu to grave in regret and Oshiomole rejected Anenih’s demands. But note that our first Prime Minister did not forget that Ahmadu Bello put him there unlike the enmity between Akintola and Awolowo.\nObasanjo had crowned more Heads of State than other Godfathers but he was soundly rejected this time around. He overstayed his welcome as a political kingmaker. Most of the Presidential candidates usually parade themselves for these juggernauts fearing their political ambitions would be crushed without their blessings. It is not only immunity that godfathers demand: not be touched or probed for past transgressions but that they would get a cut of new loots and present candidates for juicy positions in government.\nNevertheless, Saraki and Tinubu share the same trait, privilege and belong to the same class of Machiavellianism. There are those that want to die with everything they acquired in life like the ancient Pharaoh. The Gubernatorial Election will show us how many more of the godfathers, Mighty, Powerful men of “Timber and Caliber” will fall. It is up to you, regardless of parties.\nNo Nigerian should see himself as loser or winner until all the godfathers are sent home. State governments have more impact on your lives if your resources and income are not sucked off by a selected few. Do not fool yourself, no state is living up to the potential of its income. We are in the life of a one-eye man thankful that he is not totally blind. No gubernatorial candidate can win a state on the propaganda of non-indigene. Indeed, such support can be detrimental.\nThere are a few more politicians that have been more reckless and indifferent, prostituting in and out of political parties like Bukola Saraki. Kwara finally woke up and sent him to ignominious defeat from his own state. No matter what our reservation is about democracy, it has been useful in sorting out garbage for recycling them into the next life. The stench some created and introduced into our debased communities would take some time to deodorize.\nBuhari played his game well and he was forced to collaborate with Tinubu out of political expediency and for existential reasons. Buhari learnt after contesting a few times that he could not put all his eggs in one basket. The North under one people and one destiny has been shattered: divided into three, leaving him to North-East and North-West as his reliable base while North-Central has slipped away. In 1983 Buhari had tried to make up in the South by forming alliance with Okadigbo but lost against Obasanjo/Atiku ticket.\nEven North traditional foothold in the South, South-South is no longer reliable. In Presidential Election, they allied with South-East because former President Jonathan had been displaced after gaining votes North and South in the first election he won. This alliance cannot be relied on since they fear being swallowed by either the South-West or South-East. This is for the same reason in 1979, Gov. Ambrose Alli Bendel State alliance with South-West did not last past 1983.\nThough Tinubu was able to deliver divided West as expected in 2016, the adhesive force Tinubu had then has withered due to arrogance, overconfidence and indifference to those that helped him climbed in Lagos at the expense and demise of Funsho Williams. The arbitrary choice of candidates for political offices from local to state government has become overbearing. Indeed, Tinubu preferred one term candidates so that he could retain his grip on their successors.\nIt was not long ago that he tried and failed to torpedo Fashola for his second term. Oba Eko that should have respected himself by wisely playing down his involvement into politics, actually got Fashola to agree to Tinubu terms or “contract” on Lagos State; to satisfy his avarice since the Oba wanted his own cut as well. It was an ugly fight between Tinubu and Fashola. But Tinubu got his piece of flesh as Fashola got his second opportunity to contest and won.\nAmbode was not so successful. Tinubu enjoys the power to bring anyone he wants, his wife, daughter, son-in-law or son; even from nowhere and promise them positions beyond their dreams as long as they accept his terms. This was the case with Fashola and Ambode. By the time these men realize the gravity of their complicity in deals, they had to submit to Tinubu. They had limited options but deeply involved in aiding and abetting financial crimes that could throw them in jail if and when exposed. Their collaboration was a safety insurance for Tinubu!\nTinubu, no matter how clever or cunning he is can never get off scot free wishing him long life. Indeed, his time to pay for the consequences of voracious appetite has come. Many of the Yoruba that accepted him based it on the devil they know compared to that they do not know. Many of us usually wonder why a Yahoo Yahoo boy would not stop, a drug dealer would not quit or a looter would not stop and invest the money they made into some legitimate business.\nIt is for the same reason most of us enjoy certain power, privilege, love certain materials, position or crowd. We get so used to certain way of life, it becomes inconvenient to change from a game you know so well to a new one. Many rich people do change before we associate past odious practices with them. Others are forgiven while many repent and gave most of their money away to good causes. We have Saraki and Tinubu as godfathers in every state.\nIndeed, some of the grudge against Buhari were that he closed godfathers’ source of illegal incomes, rejected their nominations for positions and stifled their influence. Those actions have reduced or eliminated their reach into his Government. Some folks claimed that closing the flow of money by implementing Single Account also affected the Economy because wasteful spending to cronies ceased. Even pastors have to put their personal aircrafts up for sale since they got away with maintenance and service fees.","1":"https://www.modernghana.com/news/919049/godfathers-enough-is-enough-o-to-ge.html","2":"1479","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999580383"},{"0":"•Current fiscal distress may threaten Nigeria’s sovereignty\n•More Nigerians to fall below poverty level\n•How to save Nigeria\nBy Babajide Komolafe, Economy Editor, Udeme Akpan, Peter Egwuatu, Yinka Kolawole & Gabriel Ewepo\nThe worsening finances of the Federal Government, reflected in declining revenue, increased borrowing and debt service, will impact more misery on Nigerians, prominent economy experts and civil society groups have warned.\nThe warning is coming on the heels of recent revelations by the Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Mrs. Zainab Ahmed, that the FG, recorded a N3.09 trillion deficit in its 2022 budget implementation in four months, from January and April, as subsidy on fuel gulped N1.94 trillion, exceeding revenue for the period by 19 per cent.\nSpeaking at the Public Consultative Forum on the draft federal government 2023 – 2025 Medium Term Fiscal Framework & Fiscal Strategy, in Abuja, Ahmed said, “As of April 2022, FGN’s retained revenue was only N1.63 trillion, 49% of the prorata target of N3.32 trillion,” adding, “The actual spending as of April 31st was N4.72 trillion.”\nOut of the N4. 72 trillion, Ahmed explained that N1.94 trillion was spent on debt service; N1.26 trillion on Personnel costs, including Pensions; and N773.63 billion on capital expenditure.\nThis development, which follows a pattern, that led to the doubling of the national debt to N41.6 trillion at the end of March 31st, 2022 from N12.6 trillion at the end of 2015 as well as the continued depreciation of the naira and rise in inflation to 18.6 per cent in June. It adds to the reason for the high unemployment rate of 33 per cent and widespread poverty in country, experts who spoke to Vanguard said.\nWhile also outlining measures to address the downward economic trend and its impact on the welfare of the people, the experts, however warned Nigerians to brace up for increased hardship should the FG persist in its spending and borrowing spree.\nLess provision of critical infrastructure, amenities\nIn this regard, the Director General, Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI), Dr. Chinenye Almona, stated:”In the face of rising debt servicing costs accompanied with dwindling revenue, provision of critical infrastructure and amenities like healthcare services, education, power, roads, and security will be hard hit as funding shrinks.\nWe see the unfortunate closure of our universities since February and till now no respite in sight.\nReinforcing this position, Dr. Bayo Adedokun of the Department of Economics, University of Lagos, explained, “If government revenue dips, it will affect all the various sectors of the economy, especially Economic Affairs, which by categorization involves, agriculture, works and infrastructure, transportation, commerce, industry and solid minerals, once these sectors are affected, they can’t create jobs directly and remotely as a result of dwindling govt revenue.”\nAdedokun, who is a trade, finance and development expert, added that, “The issue of mounting debt servicing, it is no longer sustainable to use all the revenue to pay debt charges, it will have crowding-out effect on all other sectors such as education, health and social welfare, infrastructural development will be negatively affected, thereby creating wider infrastructural gap in the economy.”\nWeak purchasing power & job losses\nSimilarly, CEO, Centre for the Promotion of Private Enterprise (CPPE), Dr. Muda Yusuf, said: “The prevailing economic conditions portend a very disturbing outlook for the welfare of the average citizen.\n“Weakening revenue performance, growing fiscal deficit and rising debt service burden are indications of a vicious cycle of fiscal vulnerabilities.\n“The implications for citizens and investors are far reaching and include the following:\n•Mounting inflationary pressures.\n•Weakening purchasing power.\n•Worsening poverty conditions.\n•Further depreciation of the currency.\n•Deteriorating balance of payments position.\n•Escalating operating and production costs.\n•Ability of governments to meet financial obligations , including payment of salaries will be undermined.\n•Capacity of employers to retain and create jobs will be constrained.”\n“The extreme hardship that citizens are currently experiencing is partly traceable to the impact of FG’s fiscal rascality.”, said David Adonri, Vice Executive Chairman, Highcap Securities Limited, stressing that the current fiscal distress of FG arising from structural failures and monetary distress due to forex illiquidity have brought misery to the citizens.\n“Most worrisome is the reckless borrowing by FG from the CBN through Ways and Means advances which stands at about N21 trillion. This is about 50% of FG’s total debt exposure of N41 trillion. It fuels inflation because this credit is not predicated on any principle of money creation. It is not tied to production but mainly to finance consumption.\n“If the current fiscal distress of FG leads to sovereign default, foreign creditors whose funds are currently trapped in Nigeria, can threaten the country’s sovereignty by seizing public assets. Foreign lines of credit can be cut off and Nigeria’s letters of credit may no longer be honoured. If that happens, the impact on production and availability of imported merchandise is better not imagined.\n“The resultant consequences of macroeconomic instability, dwindling supply of social goods, underproduction, unemployment and loss of investor’s confidence are now challenges confronting citizens.”\nCommon man already paying huge price\nCommenting as well, Investment Banker/Stockbroker and CEO, Wyoming Capital and Partners, Tajudeen Olayinka, said: “Whatever hurts the economy, hurts the people. The common man is already paying a huge price for poor economic management, through persistent inflation and declining purchasing power. So, the common man will continue to suffer under this disturbing condition, while insecurity could be heightened in the process. Government must pay urgent attention to this disturbing development in Nigeria.”\nSimilarly, Professor Emeritus in Petroleum Economics and Executive Director, Emmanuel Egbogah Foundation, Wumi Iledare, said, “another point is that the public investment to create a level playing field for the rich and poor kids will be badly impacted as federation funding declines. Education will be badly affected because of centralised planning.”\nMore People will fall below poverty level\nAlso weighing in on the worsening financial conditions of the FG, Civil Society Organisations, CSO warned that more Nigerians will fall below the poverty line.\n”What do you think is going to be the hope for Nigerians, especially for the many who are below the poverty line?” asked Ene Obi, Country Director, ActionAid Nigeria, AAN.\n”We know that nearly 50 per cent of Nigerians are below the poverty line and yet we continue to borrow and what they are borrowing for they don’t use the money for it, we don’t even really understand it. Is this something that will bring in more money or you are using it for something that is not productive, there is no industrialization.\n”The issue of electricity is still a big problem. We take loans for things that are not productive. It is a very dangerous trend and more and more people will continue to go down the poverty line.”, he warned.\nThe Convener of Coalition in Defence of Nigerian Democracy and Constitution, CDNDC, Ariyo-Dare Atoye, said, “Poor management of the different aspects of the economy in the last seven years has coalesced and dealt a fatal blow to the country’s standard of living.\n”Sadly, only the poor masses are suffering the declining trend in government revenue because the ostentatious lifestyle of the greedy elites has not changed.\nPresident and Founder, One Love Foundation, OLF, Dr Patrick Eholor, said, “Whatever the FG does as regards to debt or what have you, it will always take its toll on the citizens.\n“Look at the country, from the least (Grassroots) to the average (Common man), what you will see or hear is that there is hunger in the land, this is because there is no good economic structure on the ground to make business flourish.\n”That is why when you look at the rate of employment, what you will see is that companies are not ready to employ because there is not enough money to pay staff and rather than employ they will prefer to over-labour their staff and then in turn underpay them.\n“That is what you get when a country keeps on borrowing and borrowing and then spends all its earnings on debt servicing.”\nThe Way Forward\nSpeaking on measures to reverse the worsening finances of the FG, Chinenye Almona said: “LCCI has consistently advised the government to borrow from cheaper sources and also to consider deficit financing from equity instead of the expensive debts borrowed and used for recurrent expenditures.\n“The commercialization model proposed for the NNPC Limited is the right direction to go. Once this plan succeeds next year, it should be replicated with other national corporate assets scattered across the country.”\nMuda Yusuf, of CPPE also said: “We need to undertake the following: Urgently reform government expenditure in line with prevailing realities. Address fiscal leakages at all levels of government.\n“Reform the foreign exchange market to attract private capital into the economy and stem the volatility of the currency.\n“Review the trade policy to moderate the pressure on manufacturers, especially with respect to intermediate inputs.\n“Address the growing insecurity to reverse the sharp declines in agricultural output and soaring food prices. Address the challenge of oil theft which is affecting our oil output and foreign exchange earnings.”\nAccording to CEO, Wyoming Capital and Partners, “It is either the government would have to increase taxes or withdraw completely from the subsidy regime, while also cutting back on expenditures.\n“All of these decisions at this time would hurt the economy more. I think what is more appropriate to do at this time, is to put the economy on a normal course of adjustment.\n“That is, to face reality, by simultaneously reducing current public sector dominance and increasing private sector participation.”\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"https://www.vanguardngr.com/2022/08/economic-crisis-what-to-expect-in-the-coming-days-experts/","2":"2212","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9998855591"},{"0":"The protracted absence on medical grounds of Nigeria’s President Muhammadu Buhari has stoked fears of a full-blown political crisis at the heart of Africa’s most populous nation.\nThe 74-year-old former army general left Abuja for London on January 19, leaving Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo in charge while he took time off.\nBut on the eve of his return earlier this month, it was announced that he was prolonging his stay to enable him to collect the results of unspecified medical tests.\nSpeculation, inevitably, went into over-drive that he may no longer be fit for the top job, and despite multiple claims he is well, the government has struggled to seize back the initiative.\nFor many, the situation revives memories of the situation seven years ago, when president Umaru Yar’Adua fell ill and later died while receiving treatment abroad.\nIt also once again lays bare the fragile divide between the majority Muslim north and the predominantly Christian south that characterises Nigeria and underpins political and daily life.\nSuccession to power at the federal level is seen as a balancing force between the two regions.\nIn 2010, it was the southern Christian former university professor Goodluck Jonathan who deputised for the northern Muslim Yar’Adua: now it is Osinbajo for Buhari.\nWhen Yar’Adua died, his supporters prevented Jonathan from taking over. The argument ran that the north would be short-changed if a southerner was allowed to complete Yar’Adua’s term of office.\nIt took a deft move by parliament to get Jonathan to assume power and prevent a major political melt-down.\n– What if? –\nBuhari has repeatedly had to deny opposition claims that he is seriously unwell with claims ranging from prostate cancer to kidney disease.\nJonathan’s Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) even announced on its official Twitter account last year that he had died. The presidency said he had a persistent inner ear infection.\nConversation in Nigeria has in recent weeks has revolved around “what if?” scenarios: what if Buhari were unable to carry on? What if he were to die in office?\nWhat if the north once again lost out on power to the south? How would it affect the choice of candidates for the next presidential elections in 2019?\nPolitical analysts, however, dismiss the possibility of a re-run of the Yar’Adua/Jonathan scenario.\n“There is a whole lot of difference between what happened during Yar’Adua’s time and what is happening now,” said Professor Abubakar Sadiq, from the Ahmadu Bello University in Zaria.\n“There was a leadership vacuum under Yar’Adua because he did not hand over to his deputy… and a cabal bent on hijacking power prevented Jonathan from taking over,” he told AFP.\nYar’Adua’s illness was hidden from the public until he died and his body was brought back to Nigeria in the middle of the night, the political scientist noted.\n“Nobody was allowed to see Umaru. But Buhari in his own case, handed over to his deputy. So, there is no way we will have a repeat of that ugly episode,” he added.\n– ‘Zoning’ out –\nRotating power — or “zoning” as it’s called in Nigeria — has long been assumed to be part of the constitution and at the heart of the Yar’Adua crisis.\nBut experts said it never has been and was only PDP policy.\nNow Buhari’s All Progressives Congress (APC) is in power, there is theoretically no reason why anyone of any ethnicity, religion or political affiliation can’t be president.\nOsinbajo, a trained lawyer who has long been in charge of economic policy, has widely been seen to be competent, travelling across the country and abroad, and chairing meetings.\n“If the unexpected happens, Osinbajo should assume the full mantle of leadership,” said Sadiq.\nPolitics lecturer Dapo Thomas, of Lagos state university, agreed there was no cause for concern and said the constitution was “very clear” on the succession, should it come to that.\n“If the president cannot continue because of ill health, incapacitation or death, his vice will take over,” he explained.\nThe slew of photographs in recent days of Buhari meeting delegations of well-wishers in London should go a long way to show he was not as ill as some have suggested, he added.\nBuhari’s illness had been politicised, he said, adding: “What is happening is dirty politics by mischief-makers… working to ensure that the government fails.”\nBuhari, who headed a military government in the 1980s, has been struggling to rid Nigeria of the endemic corruption that has blighted its development and plunged the country into recession.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"http://www.vanguardngr.com/2017/02/buharis-health-sparks-fresh-debate-leadership-nigeria/","2":"1096","3":"Politics","4":"2","5":"en","6":"0.9999675751"},{"0":"By Emma Amaize and Godwin Oghre\nSAPELE- ENRAGED youths, numbering over 2,000, armed with battleaxes, cutlasses and other dangerous weapons went on rampage, Friday, sacking and inflicting injuries on over 50 Muslims at the Hausa quarters, Sapele in Sapele Local Government Area of Delta State.\nA northern security guard was shot dead in a separate incident by a gang of armed robbers that attacked a school in Sapele on Thursday.\nVanguard gathered that the youths were incensed by the uninhibited attacks on churches and killing of Christians in the northern part of the country by the Islamic Boko Haram sect.\nTwo of the persons suspected to have carried out the onslaught were, however, arrested by the police in Sapele.\nThere was pandemonium following the attack on Muslims, who were ordered to vacate the town in their own interest since Boko Haram members had also issued ultimatum to Christians to leave the north.\nSecretary of a Muslim Media group in Sapele, Sadiq Oniyesaneyene Musa who spoke to Vanguard on the attacks by Sapele youths said, “We are disturbed by this attack on Muslims in Sapele and the order that all Muslims in Sapele should return to the north.

I knew the governor was going to win but I want to appeal to APC leaders and supporters to stop misleading my people. I want them to let my people go; let them be free because they are putting them through mental torture especially during the COVID-19 period. They have been fooling the people and I am saying ‘enough is enough’.\n“For the past one month in Benin, they have been wining and dining. They even slaughtered cows to celebrate in anticipation of today’s judgment. They claimed all sorts of things that they already knew that APC will win because Obaseki is in the bad books of the federal government. They claimed that Obaseki will be removed because he accused the federal government of printing money. They said the cabals in the presidency have assured them that Obaseki must go”.\n“I remembered that I told our people then not to panic or listen to them. I said Nigeria is not a banana republic where the executive arm of government will be dictating to the Supreme Court. Infact, up to two hours before this judgment, APC members were jubilating all over Edo, saying they won the election and their candidate will be sworn-in tomorrow”.\n“They even said Obaseki has moved his belongings out of Government House while others said he has run out of town. They were saying what happened in Imo state will happen in Edo but they forgot that Edo is not Imo”.\n“I feel so sorry for them and I still want to appeal to them to let my people go. When the election was going to take place, Adams Oshiomhole was boasting about using federal might. He showed them the result of an election that has not taken place. Because of his boast, 43 political appointees of Obaseki left. Many threw their careers to the dustbin”.\n“ After they lost the election, they kept boasting again that the Tribunal will upturn the result. I fear that with this judgment and the lies they have been told, some of them may attempt suicide today”.\n“My advice to them now is to join hands with the governor to move Edo forward and if they are not ready for that, let them prepare for 2024 when the next governorship election will hold” .\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"https://www.vanguardngr.com/2021/05/obasekis-s-court-victory-wait-till-2024-idahosa-tells-apc/","2":"780","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999790192"},{"0":"File: IDPs in Dikwa\nA full truck of relief materials sent to Taraba state for distribution to the Internal Displaced Persons IDPs by President Muhamadu Buhari have been declared missing by the permanent secretary Taraba state Emergency Management Agency (SEMA)\nThe permanent secretary Mr Nuvalga Dan-Habu disclosed this while conducting journalists round the venue where the relief materials were stored for self keeping in Jalingo Taraba state capital.\nThe Presidential relief materials sent to Taraba state for IDPs have recently generated controversy and war of wards between the minister for women and social development Sen.

British austerity measures have hit low-income areas like Tottenham hard.\nTheone week riots were fuelled by the killing of a black man, Mark Duggan, a 29-year-old father of four, fatally shot Thursday night last week in North London’s Tottenham Hale section. Duggan, who was a passenger in a minicab at the time of the shooting, was initially stopped as a part of an initiative to recover illegal guns in the area. Although an illegal firearm was found at the scene and initial reports suggested a gun was fired at police, The Guardian of London asserts that ballistic reports now show that all of the gunfire came from police.\nAfter Duggan was shot, his family and the Tottenham community were in shock. A peaceful protest was planned for Friday evening, and the family wanted to meet with police officials to get answers about the shooting. However, police reps refused to meet with them and the protests turned violent.\nHowever, as the riots subside, Nigerians in England and at home are counting their losses. Already, media reports say a Nigerian was killed in the riots. And this was just days after Nigerian High Commissioner to the UK, Dr Dalhatu Tafida, said there were no reason for Nigerians to fear following the on-going riots in Hackney and Peckham areas of London.\nYet, the Ghana-Nigeria friendly in Watford, England was cancelled as London was hit by four nights of rioting and looting, the worst in 25 years.\nThe UK police said it could not guarantee the safety of both players and fans as the riots continued to spread across the country. As the riots spread, President Goodluck Jonathan allegedly offered help to UK PM David Cameron. Jonathan was said to have promised to assist by sending Nigerian police to England to help quell the riots, to the chagrin of some Nigerians who think that he should stop the Boko Haram bombing in the country first.\nNigerians in the UK speaking on the riots said, “So many Blacks are away from their homelands, primarily because of present and past administrators/rulers/presidents. Black nations have never thought it wise to create conditions that will enable a majority of their citizens to find self-actualizing opportunities in their own countries. The acting out and destructive behaviour you see in the demonstrations is probably out of frustrations of not finding oneself in a foreign land and the prospects of achieving the same in the homeland is even more remote.”\nThe riots spread throughout London and beyond. But there arose racial dimension to the riots also as photos showed more of black people looting homes and shops. However, houses, cars, and businesses were burned and at least hundreds of people were arrested. Looters smashed their way into stores and stole merchandise, and groups attacked police. Groups of young people who said they were fed up by the treatment they receive by police, allegedly drove the riots.\nIt was in the midst of this that a young Nigerian man chatting with a woman at a bus stop was shot dead when an argument erupted. Reports said Daniel Famakinwa, 20, was waiting with friends for a bus in West Norwood after a night out when a row broke out with another group of young men. He was shot just after 4.15 on Saturday morning. As other people fled, the woman Famakinwa had been talking to stayed with him to try and help.\nHowever, she left when police arrived and is one of several people murder squad detectives are urging to come forward. The shooting took place in Waylett Place at the junction with Norwood Road. Famakinwa from Manor Park in east London was taken to King’s College Hospital where he died over an hour later.\nDetective Chief Inspector Caroline Goode said: “We know Daniel had been out dancing that night with a group of friends and afterwards they were waiting for a bus. There was an altercation between Daniel’s group and another group of black men who were also waiting at the bus stop which has resulted in Daniel being killed.\n”I would urge anyone who was in the area at the time, and who may have seen or heard anything suspicious, to come forward as you may hold significant information.\n”We are specifically appealing for a white woman in a checked shirt who was also at the bus stop, and who had no connection to either group, to come forward. She understandably made off at the time but we need her to contact police – she may have vital information.\n”We also want to trace a young black woman who was speaking to Daniel immediately prior to the shooting, and was present through the incident and stayed behind to help. However she left before police arrived and again we need to speak with her as a matter of urgency.\n”I believe there were also a number of other black women at the bus stop who fled after the incident, and again we need them to come foreword and make themselves known.”\nNot many Nigerians have heard about the Famakinwa death. In fact, as the riots raged, Nigerians were waiting to be blamed for the London crisis but were happy that they were not named. A report said, “As members of mandem and hoodgirls gangs and their parents lay waste to parts of North London over the weekend, Nigerian communities braced themselves to be blamed for the rioting and looting. But in an unexpected development, the London Metropolitan Police has not named Nigerians as the main suspects behind the wanton display of criminality. Baba Ijebu, a long time Tottenham resident, commented on the issue: “My son was afraid to go to work today because he thought the newspapers will be full of ‘Nigerians done it’ stories, but for once we are not to blame. We thank God!”\nHowever, President Jonathan was alleged to have offered to assist UK PM David Cameron with policemen to quell the riots. David Cameron last Thursday told MPs the riots in cities across England were “criminality pure and simple”, but there were “far too few police” on the streets. More than 1,500 arrests have been made since the unrest began on Saturday.\nTottenham is the most ethnically diverse area in all of the U.K., where, according to the last British census, some 300 languages are spoken. Large communities of Colombians, Congolese, Albanian, Kurdish, Turkish-Cypriot, Turkish, Somalis, Irish and Portuguese all call Tottenham home. And given the area has the highest unemployment rates in the city – especially amongst the young — it’s not surprising that rival ethnic gangs have staked out complicated territories here and that youth mob vigilanteism is common.\nSo, it is perhaps unsurprising that Tottenham High Street became Ground Zero for the riots that have swept across London this week.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"http://www.vanguardngr.com/2011/08/nigerians-lose-one-to-london-riots-blame-african-leaders/","2":"1499","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.999994278"},{"0":"BY OLASUNKANMI AKONI\nLAGOS — LAGOS State Government has embarked on measures to eradicate defaecation in public places by adopting the Community Led Total Sanitation, CLTS, model.\nCLTS model seeks to eradicate open defaecation and promote household latrine construction.\nThe CLTS approach is used globally for scaling up sanitation and has been piloted in Nigeria and found to be appropriate in scaling up sanitation with contributions of all stakeholders.\nCommissioner for Rural Development, Cornelius Ojelabi, said yesterday, at a six-day Train the Trainers’ Workshop on CLTS held in Lekki, Lagos, saying government was adopting the model to eradicate open defaecation in the state, while government would concentrate on providing sanitation facilities in public places.\n“The adoption of this model is sequel to the global and national successes recorded by the approach and our quest for excellence,” adding that the adoption would help to improve sanitary condition of communities in Lagos.\n“Lagos State aims to be one of the top ten megacities in the world in terms of living indices.\n“To achieve this noble desire, there is need to intensify efforts to scale up sanitation, most especially as a proactive measure to the report of WHO/UNICEF joint monitoring programme for water and sanitation which states that about 1.1 billion people in the world still defecate openly and that 81 per cent of the reported data is accounted for by just 10 countries in the world, of which Nigeria is inclusive,” he stated\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"http://www.vanguardngr.com/2013/01/lagos-to-eradicate-public-defaecation/","2":"347","3":"Politics","4":"2","5":"en","6":"0.9999504089"},{"0":"Fuel: Buhari rejects marketers’ demand for price increase\n- Price increase\n- Total deregulation of petroleum products\n- Payment of outstanding subsidy\n- Creation of special window for Forex from CBN\n- Presentation of request for payment of outstanding subsidy to National Assembly\n- Creating opportunity for the establishment of modular refineries\n- No return to era of fuel subsidy\nA subtle move by marketers for the federal government to increase fuel price appears to have failed.\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari is not disposed to the proposal, The Nation gathered yesterday.\nHe is also saying No to the re-introduction of fuel subsidy, sources said.\nThe pressure on government to effect a rise in petroleum price from N145 per litre is coming amidst the current acute fuel scarcity across the country.\nHundreds of thousands of motorists, for the fifth day running yesterday, kept searching for petrol wherever they could get it at any cost.\nCommuters, many of whom went shopping for Christmas, were made to pay high fares for transport to their destinations.\nMany others had to walk long distances.\nWell placed government sources said the administration is concentrating on finding permanent solutions to the recurring fuel crisis including checkmating sabotage by some marketers and stakeholders, and putting all the nation’s 23 depots in 100 per cent shape.\nIt was gathered that marketers are still unwilling to import products because of low or insignificant profit margin.\nThey are seeking full deregulation of petroleum products.\nKey players in the petroleum industry attribute the fuel crisis in the country to agitation for price hike by marketers, disruption of the supply chain, and sabotage by some stakeholders to force the government to deregulate the sector further.\nOne of the sources said: “The key issue is price war. The marketers have made representation to the federal government and the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Dr. Ibe Kachikwu to allow price hike of petroleum products and leave the sector to market forces.\n“The President and senior government officials are however opposed to price hike because of its spiral effects on the socio-economic life of the nation. It also has grave political implications for the survival of the present government.\n“In the last few months, the government has been trying to cope through the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) until there was stress in the supply chain following threats by PENGASSAN and the challenge in Lagos.”\nAnother stakeholder, speaking on the price war, said: “We import refined products as a nation. Once the prices of crude increase at the international market, they have effects on the cost of refined products being brought into our country.\n“The landing cost of Premium Motor Spirit (PMS) is between N165 and N170 per litre. The marketers are claiming that the profit margin is insignificant and they cannot recover cost, they say they need to top up prices since they no longer enjoy subsidy.\n“Initially, the same marketers said they had subsidy arrears to collect from the government and they will not import products. The arrears have not been appropriated for by the National Assembly and there was nothing the government can do.”\nBut a government source said: “To mitigate the issues raised by the marketers, this administration put some measures in place. For instance, the government created a special foreign exchange window for the marketers to enable them to import products.\n“Instead of using the forex, some of them diverted it to other use. In order not to hold the nation into ransom by the marketers, NNPC in the last one and a half years has been importing 99.9% of products. This sole importation also drains the resources of NNPC but it has to sacrifice to ensure availability of products.\n“And if NNPC imports, it sells to marketers but they are still complaining of low profit margin. The importation chain has its own stress because for the storage of the products, NNPC can only accommodate 55% of the products. The oil majors cater for 30% and independent marketers take charge of about 15%. So, at any point, these marketers are still needed.\n“The alternative is for all the nation’s 23 depots to be operating at maximum capacity to check the antics of the marketers.”\nA minister, who should know, also said the government was suspecting sabotage by some stakeholders.\nHis words: “Before the present crisis, the nation used to consume between 30million to 35million litres of Premium Motor Spirit (PMS) daily but since this current challenge started, the consumption has shot up to 80million litres per day.\n“Without a soothsayer, it is obvious that something had gone wrong. We cannot just rule out sabotage including diversion of products.”","1":"http://thenationonlineng.net/fuel-crisis-buhari-rejects-marketers-demand-price-hike/","2":"989","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999694824"},{"0":"*Northern leaders ‘ve to check their youths\nBy Bashir Adefaka\nGeneral Yakubu Dan-Yumma Gowon (Jack), GCFR, Nigeria’s former Military Head of State (1966 – 1975) is seldom available. Not in the sense of foreign trips; he is enmeshed in innumerable engagements in the good interest of the nation. At 76, the former ruler is often oblivious of the natural call for the required rest an ageing septuagenarian of his stature should have.\nNot a strong fighter for One Nigeria like Jack Gowon would leave fire on the roof-top and then go to bed. He believes that, as a father-figure of Nigeria, it would be too irresponsible to do so. The main reason, at 76, he never leaves any stone unturned in trying to help engender peace situation in the country. The mantle fell on what a commentator described as “his slim shoulders” at the age of 32 (in 1966) to lead Nigeria after the second coup and during his regime, the monumental structures on which successive governments have struggled to build upon were laid.\nBorn October19, 1934 in Lur, Plateau State, General Gowon had his first education at St. Bartholomew’s School, Wasasa, Zaria between 1939 and 1949. He moved from there to the Government College, Zaria where he obtained his school certificate in 1953. As Head of State he had to grapple with Civil War considered by the Supreme Military Authority under him as capable of threatening the continuous togetherness of the entity called Nigeria.\nAnd he fought the war with his sixth sense to bring Nigeria back together as one through his ‘no victor, no vanquished’ approach. He would never agree he won the Civil War. Not even last Wednesday night when he had to respond to questions posed by Vanguard. He maintained, “It was not a fight against enemies; I mean you see brothers fighting to keep the country together. And in the end, that was what happened. Nobody won, nobody lost.” No wonder the exemplary legacy that has cohabited with his name “Go On With One Nigeria (GOWON). Excerpts:\nAt a time Nigerians detest military and are talking negative about former military leaders, you stand out and your achievements as military Head of State are widely celebrated all over the country. How did you do it?\nI give the credit and credence to Nigerian people. They wanted something good and we worked together to get it. They didn’t leave me alone to it; they were quite supportive, they advised me quietly and I was the only one seen in the public doing the job. In most cases, they gave me a lot of advice on the pages of newspapers, which I made use of and which really, I must say, helped me in the many achievements that I made.\nCivil servants many a time are accused of sabotaging the effort of government leaders. What was the quality of civil servants like at your time?\nThe civil servants at my time rendered quality-based services. They were very cooperative, loyal and committed. And the politicians, everybody was cooperating. And then you know, back to your question about my achievements, I can assure you honestly speaking, to me, I give them back to the people. The fact I took the welfare of the people as one of the priorities of my government was for nothing but for the mere fact of realising it was my duty as a leader.\nBecause, by then, I tried to the best of my capacity to think much and work more on their welfare instead of the good of my personal self and that was appreciated by them. And it was greatly appreciated by the people and so they were supporting me always. It was because my government was\nperforming to the satisfaction of the people that the people had confidence in me and supported me without much ado. And it was because they supported me that I was not sabotaged. That was how I was able to achieve what I achieved.\nBut it was your government that fought the Civil War…\nI know we had to fight but it was not a fight of hatred. It was not a fight against enemies; I mean you see brothers fighting to keep the country together. And in the end, that was what happened. Nobody won, nobody lost.\nIt became quite clear that your ‘no victor no vanquished’ approach to resolving the Civil War issue was a leadership style of achieving a One Nigeria without feeling of guilt by any side. But the Nigeria’s unity you fought hard to achieve about 41 years ago is being threatened by sectional, political and religious crises here and there. What is your feeling about it and what is the way out?\nQuite frankly, one regrets the incidences of violence by man against humanity. I thought frankly since we went in and had been able to come out of the Civil War, that Nigerians should forget acts of violence against one another and settle down properly to live in peace with one another. It is my sincere thought that after the Civil War, again, that we would begin to love one another and love our country by putting hatred aside. If you do that you would always be thinking of the interest of the country and good of the people.\nThat all this show of hatred still happens years after the Civil War is highly regrettable. The solution to it is that, Nigerians have to be patriotic and be faithful to their country. Instead of using tribe, politics or religion as tool for violence, they should see it the other way by using it to buttress their loyalty and patriotism to their country, Nigeria.\nWe’ve got to learn, especially through the two religions that we have, how to be able to live together and do things together in peace loving each other. That I think has worked out really in the West where they have a lot of religious differences and yet, they don’t seem to be a serious issue. They don’t go on fighting each other but they live side by side respecting each other, marrying each other, et-cetera.\nUnfortunately in the North that is not the case. I think the leadership in the North, especially the leadership at the lower level should really rein in their young militants to ensure that they do not have the hearts of violence against their brothers whether of the same religion or of other religion.\nYou know, that leadership, unfortunately, they are the ones that talk to those people and encourage them to do what they are doing. Certainly at very high level, the feeling is against that sort of things. But I’m afraid down the level especially the political, the religious, they seem to encourage that sort of thing. And I appeal to them to really look seriously after the issues and try to calm these excesses and rein in their followers on how they should think of the good of themselves and the good of people of other tribes, religion and whatsoever.\nCould you tell us little about your childhood and how you really started out in life?\nI was born into a disciplined background of a religious parenthood. I was brought to be righteous, religious and to be a good person. And then I went to school, which was a mission school and then I went to train as a soldier and as an officer in the Army. All I can tell you is that I started out in life with the mindset of trying to be a good citizen, a good officer and a good Nigerian to the nation and to the community where I came from.\nMy training as a soldier and as an officer really instilled in me that commitment, loyalty and patriotism for my country. And I think that was why really I was able to feel and readily take up that challenge when the country was to break up and I had to do something to check and stop it.\nLuckily, that, we were able to do with the cooperation of the good, quality people I was blessed to be able to put together in my cabinet and with the support of the generality of the Nigerian people. That was how I started out in life. Those training projected me to be a good person in the future and, for this, I will forever be grateful to my parents, my community, my church and of course my school.\nAt a very young age ever recorded of any Nigerian you rose to the highest office as Head of State and Commander-in-Chief of the Nigerian Armed Forces.\nYes. And for that I thank God.\nWhen that leadership reality dawned on you and you took office, what did you have in mind to make of Nigeria as an achievement you could be remembered for?\nYou would want to achieve the best for your country but I believe you can’t achieve all. You only try your part and leave the rest.\nHowever, I wanted to develop Nigeria and of course I wanted to keep Nigeria together as one and by so doing we were able to get young Nigerians to serve together in areas other than their places of birth so that they could know one another, get used to what ordinarily could have been differences among them and live together with that understanding in peace and tranquility.\nThat was what I did with my establishment of the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC). It is only sad that recently some youth corps members had to sacrifice their lives for the sake of the country in trying to ensure that the nation moved forward through credible, free and fair electoral process. I must say that the loss of lives of those young people in parts of our country in the service of their nation hasn’t portrayed those responsible for the sad development as loyal and patriotic people.\nIt is barbaric and I believe, by the pains that followed, we have learnt our lessons, the more reason we should not rage at arms or rage for whatever reason against each other. To me, I think the government should do something about it because, seriously speaking, it is sad. Mine is to see a peaceful Nigeria, a developed Nigeria, a Nigeria that can really and notably be counted in the group of developed countries of the world. Okay?\nI’m okay. Except that Your Excellency has not told us why you did not marry until you had got to office as Head of State…\nIt had to do with my busy schedule, moving round because of the nature of my profession. And again, even at the time I took over as head of state, the crisis (civil war) caught us at a wrong time. I had to face it squarely and so, there was no time for frivolous things.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"http://www.vanguardngr.com/2011/05/41-years-enough-to-heal-wounds-of-civil-war-gowon/","2":"2188","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999980927"},{"0":"By Chioma Gabriel, Deputy Editor\nDiscordant tunes are rising from the North, distorting the once political homogeneity of that part of the country ahead of next month’s elections, particularly the presidential race.\nFacing President Goodluck Jonathan in the election are the likes of General Muhammadu Buhari, a former military ruler, Mallam Nuhu Ribadu, pioneer Chairman, EFCC, and Governor Ibrahim Shekarau (Kano).\nThe once powerful Arewa Consultative Forum, ACF, is sharply divided, its chairman, General Ibrahim Haruna having been sacked over his perceived support for President Goodluck Jonathan; while the recently formed Northern Political Leaders Forum, NPLF, appears unsteady after some of its members were taken in by the State Security Service, SSS, over alleged plot to “poison” President Jonathan.\nA new group has since emerged, called Northern Stakeholders, which says NPLF should not be trusted.\nMeanwhile, elder statesman, Alhaji Tanko Yakassai says the North “has not chosen anybody to speak for it.”\nNPLF yet to decide — Bello\nThe Secretary General of NPLF, Mallam Abdulkadir-Bello says it is not true that the group has decided to throw in its lot with President Jonathan.\nMallam Bello who was one of the NPLF members quizzed by the SSS said: “ The NPLF has not yet decided on whether to support Jonathan candidacy or not.\nThe decision day by NPLF was the day I was arrested. But we would meet very soon on that. But seriously speaking, there could be 5th columnists either on our side or their side trying to disrupt whatever move either of the groups is trying to make.\nIt’s strange, baseless and ordinarily ,common sense would have revealed that some people are out to achieve an ulterior motive.\nWe don’t trust NPLF,–Northern Stakeholders Forum\nHowever, a member of the newly formed Northern Stakeholders Forum said: NPLF and Atiku want to enter an agreement with Jonathan which we in Northern Stakeholders Forum, are opposed to.\nOur aim is not to support Jonathan but to bring together all the progressive forces in the North. Our activities have seriously dented Adamu Ciroma whose wife is out there campaigning vigorously for Jonathan.\nCiroma should not be pretending he is not supporting Jonathan when his wife is out there doing so. Why would Bibi Farouk want to kill Jonathan? Why would they want to do that and how? Does Jonathan go about drinking or eating anyhow ? They are trying to revive their legitimacy. That is why no group from the North is raising dust over the harassment of NPLF members.\nTo us, the harassment was stage managed .\n“Our group is against insulting Jonathan but our main agitation is for all presidential candidates from the North to step down for one candidate. It is either we have Buhari or Ribadu or Shekarau or John Dara even though the last two are not significant players because they do not pose any threat. John Dara, is an eloquent man but not a threat to any presidential candidate.\n“This arrest is stage-managed, plotted to prepare ground to enter Jonathan’s government. We pointed out the inconsistencies of Ciroma in the past . Ciroma has no electoral value and cannot deliver a ward. Even Jonathan has come to accept that fact.\nArresting them is giving them credibility so as to pave the way for working with Jonathan. Why would they poison Jonathan? . It is an insult to our credibility.\nAnd come to think of it, no Northern group raised hell over these arrests and is that not telling you something? Something is fishy here.\nWe don’t play politics in ACF – Aliko Mohammed, ACF Chairman\nAlhaji Aliko Mohammed who replaced IBM Haruna as Chairman, Arewa Consultative Forum says:\n“Our points in politics are well known and of course, we will prefer a Northern presidential candidate. We have three Northern presidential candidates in the persons of Buhari, Ribadu and Shekarau who are also members of ACF.\nThe PDP has got theirs and in their constitution, they talked about zoning which they are not keeping. Sambo attended our meeting last week Tuesday like other members. We have not decided on any of the Northern presidential candidates.\nThey are politicians and ACF is not about politics. ACF is not like NPLF which is a Northern political group led by Ciroma who is a member of PDP. ACF cannot speak on SSS arrest of NPLF members because they are politicians and members of PDP. It’s not ACF’s problem because they are not being hounded as members of ACF. It’s a political issue and not a matter for ACF.”\nNobody is mandated to speak for the North — Yakassai\nAlhaji Tanko Yakassai, elderstatesman says nobody is mandated to speak for the North on presidency 2011.\n“The North has not chosen anybody to speak for it. There are three people vying for this position and every one of them is sponsored by a political party that is made up of people who believe in its manifestoes. These people are national presidential candidates, not Northern political candidates.\nWe have the NPLF who are people in the PDP who decided to set up a committee to pick one of them as a consensus presidential candidate. It was entirely a matter for PDP. The three candidates from the North are candidates of Nigeria and they are supported by their parties.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee

has declared himself unfit\nBy Ise-Oluwa Ige\nABUJAâ€”An Abuja-based constitutional lawyer, Mr Kayode Ajulo, has invoked the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal high court sitting in Abuja, asking it to declare, without further delay, Dr Jonathan Goodluck as the Acting President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria on the account that President Umaru Musa Yarâ€™Adua had duly informed the leadership of the National Assembly through his 12 January 2010 broadcast of his temporary inability to perform the functions of his office.\nAjulo is the fourth and the latest litigant in the legal quest by majority of Nigerians to ensure that the ailing President Umaru Musa Yarâ€™Adua steps down on the account of his ill-health to enable Jonathan begin the performance of presidential functions in his own right as acting president in line with the provision of section 145 of the 1999 constitution.\nAjulo invoked the original jurisdiction of the court on a day radical Lagos lawyer, Mr Femi Falana, tendered the transcript of the same 12 January 2010 broadcast by President Umaru Musa Yarâ€™Adua in court to invite Justice Adamu Bello, the new judge, to hold that it amounted to a written declaration as required by section 145 of the 1999 constitution to allow his vice begin to perform the presidential functions as acting president.\nFalana tendered Yar’Adua’s speech in court\nHe said although the Attorney-General of the Federation, Chief Michael Kaase Andoakaa, SAN, had refused to answer the seven questions he served on him about the health status of Yarâ€™Adua, he said the president had saved the situation by transmitting the required written declaration to the appropriate authourities through the BBC broadcast, the transcript now published by Nigerian newspapers, to the effect that he would not be able to perform the functions of his office for now until otherwise advised to so do by his doctors.\nHe is urging the court not to waste time to okay his request by declaring Jonathan as the acting President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria so that he could start to perform the functions of the office in his own right.\nIn the fresh originating summons already lodged at the registry of the Abuja Federal high court, the constitutional lawyer, Ajulo, is also inviting the court to hold that the Yarâ€™Aduaâ€™s broadcast to Nigerians, including the President of the Senate and Speaker of the House of Representatives, the transcript of which had been received and read by them, amounted to activation of the provisions of section 145 of the 1999 constitution.\nVanguard recalled that Yarâ€™Adua had indeed addressed the nation on 12 January, this year at a time when rumour of his death since 10 December 2009 in Saudi Arabia as reported by American Chronicle, was rife.\nThe most outspoken member of the Federation Executive Council, FEC, Chief Michael Andoakaa had earlier told Nigerians that the president was not dead and that he was fit both in body and mind to continue governance.\nIn fact, he told all that cared to listen, including the Abuja Federal high court through several affidavits that Yarâ€™Adua was okay and he is empowered by section 5(1) to govern the country from anywhere in the world.\nBut the President himself came out to say on the 12 January 2010 that it was not true that he was medically fit to govern.\nHe said he was sick and that he was hoping that he would soon get well to be able to perform the functions of his office.\nHe said presently, his doctors advised him against shouldering the heavy burden of the office.\nHe said as much as he wanted to continue in office, he told Nigerians, including the leadership of the National Assembly who ought to know the status of his health by virtue of the provisions of section 145 of the 1999 constitution that he would not be able to govern until his doctors okayed him fit.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or

recovered without infecting anybody, by Edo Speaker\nEdo State House of Assembly Speaker Frank Okiye on Thursday spoke about his recovery from Coronavirus (COVID-19) after 21 days in isolation without infecting anyone with the deadly virus.\nOkiye, who addressed reporters in Benin, the state capital, said all he did to prevent infesting his aides, family members and friends with the virus was strict adherence to government guidelines, especially those on social distancing, compulsory use of face masks, among others.\nThe Speaker, who is the index COVID-19 case in Edo State, is among the 10

What are the weapons for? Their main aim in all these attacks is to achieve secession, working with a group fighting for Ambazonia Republic in the Republic of Cameroon.\n“The narrative of the herdsmen is meant to serve as a distraction from the major issue. What is actually happening is a secessionist fight that is building.

I’m a 35-year-old woman and met a very handsome 43-year-old man. We’ve been dating for five months now and still haven’t slept together. My problem is that in the beginning of our relationship, he asked mhow many men I’ve slept with and worried about how he would react, I lied and told him I’d slept with seven men. But after a few months, I could not live with the lie and finally decided to tell him the reason why I still haven’t slept with him yet.\nI told him I didn’t want to make love because I was scared that he’d lose respect and eventually leave me like all the other men. At this point he asked me again, just how many men were there, to which I replied forty-three.\nHis reply was, “Hmm, one for each of my birthday.” And from that day on, I never heard from him again. I don’t get it , why is it that when men sleep around, they’re studs , yet when women sleep around, they’re sluts ? Why can’t women have their fun too?\nI’ve spoken with quite a number of women asking the same question. I don’t want to pass judgment on women, nor am I saying that women shouldn’t enjoy themselves sexually. But men and women are never the same. You expressed fear about losing respect and the way I feel as a woman is that women should be worshiped by their men.\nAn object that has value is worshiped, respected, cherished, and shared with very few deserving people. As soon as you start sharing that object with anyone and without care, the object starts to lose value. The more people use the object, the more it depreciates and the less bargaining power it has: this is a plain psychological fact of life.\nMost women don’t realize the importance men place on a woman’s promiscuity. Women think that because men don’t care about how many women they’ve slept with, they won’t care about how many men their woman has slept with. But the reality is that most men, those looking for a serious relationship and not a one-night stand do place great value on a woman’s sexual restraint.\nThere was a time when many women cherished their bodies much like a sacred temple where only a noble man, one who respected and loved her, had access to her body.\nBut over time, it seems that women have failed to realize the important role their sexuality plays in finding a long-term mate. Thanks to the women’s movement, women are so busy trying to compete with men, including in the sex department, that they fail to realize the consequences of their actions.\nToday, it seems that women are the ones who are collecting notches on their Prada belts by giving their bodies away too easily. But if women themselves don’t value their bodies like they used to, why should men?\nSome women will argue that if men have the right to sleep around, so should women. But I ask only one question: If women adamantly believe this, then why is it that when faced with the question of how many men have they slept with, most women who have slept around with truckloads of men always lie?\nSome women will rationalize that they must do so because men can’t handle the truth. But if this is the case, why don’t women let men decide for themselves if they can or can’t handle it? Why do women need to lie to protect men’s egos? I think women lie to protect themselves rather than men because if it’s not shame or regret that’s making you hold your tongue, then the potentially dire consequences of the truth surely are.\nThe power lies with women…\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"http://www.vanguardngr.com/2016/02/i-lost-my-man-because-i-slept-with-so-many-men/","2":"857","3":"Romance","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999961853"},{"0":"El-Rufai secures $6m loan for light rail, BRT\nKaduna State has secured a $6 million loan from Indian Xing Bank to build Kaduna light rail from Rigachikun to Maraban Rido and French concessionary line of credit to build Bus Rapid Transit (BRT), Governor Nasir El-Rufai has said.\nAddressing the ground breaking of BRT in Kaduna, El-Rufai said as part of the State Government efforts to ease traffic congestion, it conceived a three-prong approach towards solving the transportation problems for efficient human and vehicular movement.\nHe said: ‘’We began to explore the possibility of having a light rail stretching from Rigachikun to Maraban Rido and we made progress securing financing from Indian Xing Bank to the tune of 6 million dollars to execute that project.\n‘’We engaged the famous French Transportation Consulting firm, Systra to do the feasibility studies as well as engineering design for the project, however, government has been unable to find someone that will operate the light rail when it is completed.\n“And we think it is important to do that before we proceed.

In the same way, it was gathered that he has made it known that he has nothing to do with the Northern Governors Forum led by the Governor of Borno State, Alhaji Kashim Shettima.\nInstead, the particular governor has reportedly encouraged the emergence of a group made up of himself and his counterparts in Katsina and Nasarawa States, Aminu Bello Masari and Umaru Tanko Al-Makura respectively. The trio are said to have labelled themselves as Buhari’s favourite governors.\nMeanwhile, sources said the governor has been openly boasting that he has Buhari’s word to help him with his presidential ambition in 2019.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"http://www.vanguardngr.com/2015/07/2019-presidency-govs-forum-nass-are-new-battlegrounds/","2":"555","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9990743995"},{"0":"THE rumour over factional leadership of the Igbo socio-cultural organisation in Lagos has been debunked by the body of Ndi- Eze in Lagos, with a declaration that there was only one Ohaneze Ndi-Igbo President in the state\nTo this effect, the body of Ndi-Eze at a conference in Lagos declared that Chief Sunday Ossai was the constitutionally recognised Ohaneze Ndi-Igbo President in Lagos State.\nSpeaking at the conference, Eze Ndigbo Ikosi/Isheri, Eze Ambassador Remi Anyamele who is also the Secretary General, Council of Ndieze Lagos State and Eze Nicholas Njoku Eziokwubundu, Eze Ndi-Igbo of Ejigbo, clarified that “there can never be two presidents because the single term of four years tenure of office, for the erstwhile president of the organization, Lagos State Chapter, has ended and the constitution of Ohaneze does not allow tenure elongation for any position whatsoever”.\nThey stated that Ossai was elected into office as the President of Ohaneze Ndi-Igbo, Lagos State Chapter in 2022 and had asserted that he had all it takes to lead Ndi-Igbo in Lagos. The conference according to them became necessary in order to make clarification on who had the legitimate right to move the social cultural organization forward.

Excerpts.\nAfter everything, the Rivers governorship election has been annulled by the Tribunal with an order for the conduct of fresh election within 90 days. How do you feel about this judgment?\nAny lover of true democracy and justice who witnessed what happened will not be surprised with the judgment. I belong to that group. The elections were neither free nor fair nor credible, so they can’t stand honest scrutiny. I have said this repeatedly. The APC won the case for all of Rivers State, kudos to them. In 2007, I fought PDP to a standstill and the same people in the APC today were the beneficiaries of my fight. It is not about persons or political parties. It is about the state. I did not say I am celebrating the judgment. I said I am not surprised by it. But in Rivers politics, the analog politicians cannot understand the difference.\nPeople were confused as to which side of the divide you belonged after Wike was declared winner in the election, because you didn’t contest the outcome in court. Won’t your support of the judgment raise questions?\nWhy? In my Post Election Statement in April, I clearly highlighted my displeasure in the outcome of the elections. I said, it is no longer in doubt that the election in Rivers State was neither free nor fair nor credible. I added that rather than the Jubilation of a victory or the recriminations of a defeat, I and my team prefer to keep searching for peace. I lamented on the\nand just wanted it to stop. No matter how much we find justice, if so many people in Rivers State are killed, who will be left to lead. This did not only show my disappointment in the conduct of the election but also my concern over peace in my state. It is not about taking sides with PDP or APC, it is about the truth. Both parties were violent. Not condemning the elections would be tantamount to aligning with the PDP, going to court would be tantamount to aligning with the APC. There was no additional value in my going to court. I didn’t steal money so I will not spend hundreds of millions on lawyers as if my people do not need help for other more important things.\nThe Labour Party in the State has disassociated itself from your statement praising the Tribunal’s judgment, on the premise that you are on suspension. How would you react to this?\nTo the best of my knowledge we have freedom of speech and right of opinion in Nigeria. My statements have always been my opinion and until recently, my party has always fallen in line with my thinking. From what I gathered, the state party Chairman dissociated the party from my recent comments on the outcome of the tribunal; but it baffles me that the party’s position is in line with the same comment they now disown. They after all submitted a petition to the same election tribunal. It’s also funny to note that a chieftain of the party condemned the judgment only a few days ago, claiming to be speaking on behalf of the Party Chairman. This is not just an embarrassment to my party, but a clear indication of poor leadership. I’ll leave him to his conscience. I have mine. No matter how much inducement you put in front of me, I cannot say black is white. People need to realize we are now in a digital world. Black and white TVs have been replaced by colour.\nYou dragged the party leadership to court over your suspension, what is the position of the case at the moment?\nYes, I did. I saw no justifiable reason for the purported suspension, so I simply took my concerns to the court. If people have been induced to kick me out of the party, the attempt should be made properly, not based on baseless allegations. He claimed anti party activities. Tell me; are his current actions not anti party? My lawyers have briefed me that the Party leadership has severally snubbed the court proceedings. I know the court will soon come up with a position on that matter, like they did on my candidature. Till then, I remain a proud member of the Labour Party and the movement. He remains in contempt of the court.\nDo you see yourself doing better than you did earlier should you partake in the anticipated re-run as LP candidate?\nI am yet to take a position on the role to play in the rerun; but even if I do partake, it’s really not about me. It’s about the decision of the people. They all know the political players in the state. They all know the possible after effect of a PDP or an APC victory. Politics is not war. There must be a winner and a looser. I am comfortable with either, because I am not desperate to be Governor; PDP and APC are. How that will produce a peaceful Rivers State, I am yet to find out. If Rivers People want Unity, Peace, a Government they can reach and believe that their votes will count, I believe my style of politics will have a better chance. PDP and APC need to adopt it. If they do, I may even support one of them. What matters is the state to move forward.\nYou said after the election that you were not aligning with either APC or PDP as allegedly requested by some people in your party. Do you still maintain your non-alignment stance, despite the Tribunal judgment that sacked Wike and others?\nYes, I do. I stand outside the PDP and the APC box and with the peace loving, forward thinking people of Rivers State. Not a popular position for many of our politicians, but it is here I find comfort. My opinions may help APC today or PDP tomorrow; that is not my problem. I do not speak for them. What remains consistent is my commitment to the comfort of the common Rivers man. I believe that the hate for Amaechi or APC because of what they did to Jonathan should not cloud our judgment and stop us from saying the truth. If PDP is the beneficiary of this sham today, APC should know that they can’t try it tomorrow. Will I not complain if that happens? Of course I will. If electoral violence is excused today, it will become normal tomorrow.\nWhat can you say about the controversy that surrounded Amaechi’s ministerial screening at the Senate, particularly from Rivers Senators?\nWe’ve waited so long for this, and are eager to see the difference it will make. And like I always say, President Buhari is the President, whether his administration is moving the nation fast or slow, we should focus more on helping him, than pulling him down. I know Amaechi; and I know his abilities. He worked seriously for the APC and if he missed the VP slot and the SGF slot, why should PDP lose sleep if he becomes a Minister? I was praying we don’t disgrace ourselves before the world. I am glad we did not totally disgrace ourselves. I am not sure his inclusion did the President any huge favours in perception ratings, but perception is subjective to the individual and so we will leave each to their own. PDP gave us Wike. APC has given us Amaechi. Rivers people are watching. I believe though that with the right motivation, cross party support and a little prayer, he can be a useful tool in Buhari’s cabinet. Let us leave it to God.\nAgain, let me just say I hope it is over. After a while it became too much, I lost interest. I advise the PDP senators, they should let it be – they have made their point. I am happy that the amusement for some has been cut short. I was abroad and I know what people who mattered are saying about us.\nDo you regret not defecting to the APC way before the 2015 elections?\nWhy should I? The ideology of the APC at that time was, “Bring down Jonathan”, and I was on a totally different wavelength. So regretting is not a possibility. I am also happy I left the PDP. You can’t mistreat a man with a mandate and expect him to stay silent and clap for you. Not me. I have supporters. I have a caucus and I do not act alone. We listen and we learn. Of course we make mistakes. That’s why pencils have erasers. But in all, we do it not for ourselves but for the Rivers people.\nWhat is your take on the ongoing anti-corruption campaign?\nThe anti-corruption campaign was the foundation of the Buhari campaign, so it is expected that a lot would be happening in that area. So far, so good, but it is yet to enjoy the confidence of all sides. The reason for this is obvious. Not a lot of APC people are in the dock. I suggest we stay tuned, there is still plenty time for that. No man who is just settling in will fight on too many fronts. Besides it is for the agencies charged with these responsibilities to do their work, unless there is evidence to show, the Presidency is interfering, let us await the results.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"http://www.vanguardngr.com/2015/11/pdp-apc-must-sacrifice-to-have-a-violence-free-rerun-tonye-princewill/","2":"1993","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999961853"},{"0":"The All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential candidate Bola Tinubu has named Kabiru Masari as his running mate for the 2023 elections.\nA chieftain of the party Kabiru Faskari said this during an interview on Channels Television’s Politics Today.\n“Ibrahim Kabiru Masari is our vice presidential nominee.

It is a thorny decision because Mr. Buhari is an improvement over his disastrous predecessor, Goodluck Jonathan, and is fighting Boko Haram, the Islamist extremists who have terrorized the region. But he has not done enough to end corruption and respond to charges that the army has committed war crimes in its fight against the group. Selling him the planes now would be a mistake.\nUnder Mr. Buhari, Nigeria has cooperated more with Chad and Niger to fight Boko Haram. The group, which emerged in the early 2000s, has seized land in the northeastern, predominantly Muslim section of Nigeria. Thousands of people have been killed and 2.2 million displaced. The group’s depravity captured world attention in 2014 when it kidnapped 276 girls from a secondary school.\nWhile violence is down and some territory has been recaptured, the group continues to attack remote villages and refugee camps, and it is using women and children as suicide bombers. American military officials say that Boko Haram has begun collaborating with the Islamic State and that the groups could be planning attacks on American allies in Africa.\nYet Nigeria’s government cannot be entrusted with the versatile new warplanes, which can be used for ground attacks as well as reconnaissance. Its security services have long engaged in extrajudicial killings, torture and rape, according to the State Department’s latest annual human rights report. Amnesty International says that during the army’s scorched-earth response to Boko Haram between 2011 and 2015, more than 8,200 civilians were murdered, starved or tortured to death.\nThe Obama administration was so concerned about this record that two years ago it blocked Israel’s sale of American-made Cobra attack helicopters to Nigeria and ended American training of Nigerian troops.

Godswill Akpabio; President John Mahama of Ghana and President Goodluck Jonathan, at Akwa Ibom Airport during the inauguration of Akwa Ibom International Stadium Complex in Uyo /Nan\nBy Emmanuel Aziken, Political Editor, Clifford Ndujihe & Kingsley Omonobi\nThe Peoples Democratic Party, PDP is to use today’s expected declaration by President Goodluck Jonathan for a second term to project his delivery on key strategic promises made ahead of the 2011 elections, campaign officials have disclosed.\nA document formulated by a strategy team at the national party headquarters has projected that the president would be the candidate to beat if key achievements of the administration are brought into focus.\nMeanwhile a host of interest groups including party stakeholders and youth groups have flooded the federal capital for the ceremony. In anticipation of the mass influx into the federal capital, the police has mapped out alternative routes for motorists and other road users.\nThe achievements of the Jonathan administration expected to be tabled at today’s declaration will comprise key indicators in economic growth, transport, agriculture and energy inside sources have disclosed.\nSecurity which was not a major issue ahead of the 2011 campaign is not expected to be used as a template by the party strategists in the presentation. The administration has been hard pressed in tackling the insurgency fuelled by the Islamist Boko Haram group.\nThe document read in part: “Apart from being an incumbent who would not have to learn on the job, the President has delivered on set targets and he is stabilizing the polity.\n“He has given hope to Nigerians by his performance and his support of democratic structures. His support base is not regional or ethnic base, he is delivering on the objectives of the party and none of his opponents can claim to have widespread support base close to his own. You do not change a horse in the middle of a race.”\nA party source said: “We will be thumping up the president’s achievements in the last four years and we will ask our opponents to dispute them. A lot of documents have been put together to communicate to Nigerians including the one by the One Nigeria Coalition. We are going to be stating clearly what Jonathan has done to lift the country.\n“If we take just three areas, Agriculture, Transport and Energy, Nigerians will agree that no one can dispute our achievements. Are you going to say agric is not better under this government? We are importing less food and we are feeding our people. Transportation is also better whether it is rail, air or road. In energy sector, the President is working assiduously to end the era of darkness.\nSupport groups invade Abuja, JYV unveils new campaign office\nApart from the Transformation Ambassadors of Nigeria (TAN), notable groups that are in Abuja and expected at the Eagle Square today for the ceremony include the Jonathan Youth Vanguard (JYV), which will open its new campaign office in Abuja, today and the National Coalition for Jonathan and Sambo Presidency (NACOJSP).\nJYV Director General of the group, Mr. Ebis Orubebe, in a statement yesterday, said the office, which has a media centre, conference room and other facilities and centrally located at Garki Mall will officially be launched on a day President Jonathan will declare his re-election bid.\nOrubebe, who said the job of the group “is to mobilise youth and women support for Mr. President’s transformation agenda,” said after unveiling the office, members and supporters drawn from all parts of the country will proceed on a procession to Eagles Square, President Jonathan’s presidential declaration.\nAlso, the NACOJSP National Secretary, Dr. Benjamin Onoriode Irikefe, said the president’s second term bid will be a coronation.\nIrikefe who said the second term bid would be a good omen for Nigeria said: “The truth is that the 2015 presidential election would be a mere coronation ceremony for President Jonathan. When you say coronation ceremony, it means the king makers, in this case, Nigerians, have already decided and they are saying this is the man we have chosen. Nigerians are going to vote in February 2015 to ratify the re-election of President Jonathan as Nigerian leader for another four years. Nigerians have decided to return him for another four years. The 2015 election is a self-fulfilling prophecy and in fact, it is going to turn out to be a coronation ceremony for President Jonathan.’’\nMeanwhile, the Police in Abuja have said there will be diversion of traffic around the Abuja Metropolis which it was gathered was for security purposes.\nA statement signed by CP Emmanuel Ojukwu, FPRO said, “This is to alert the public of a major event taking place at Eagle Square Abuja tomorrow Tuesday, 11th November, 2014.\n“Members of the public are advised to use alternative routes, as vehicular traffic will be diverted from most of the roads leading in and out of Eagle Square Central Business District, Abuja between 0500am and 0800pm of Tuesday, 11th November, 2014.\n“The Nigeria Police Force regrets any inconvenience the diversion of vehicular movements within the area may cause members of the public, as this is one of the proactive security measures put in place to avoid break down of law and order in the area and Abuja at large.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"http://www.vanguardngr.com/2014/11/jonathan-project-key-gains-todays-declaration/#sthash.wbXLynUT.dpuf","2":"1162","3":"Politics","4":"0","5":"en","6":"0.9999752045"},{"0":"By SIMON EBEGBULEM\nBENIN— THE member representing Akoko-Edo federal constituency of Edo State in the House of Representatives, Mr. Peter Akpatason, weekend, accused the Minister of Finance, Dr. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, of being insensitive to the plight of Nigerian students, saying that “she has been blackmailing Nigerians that government does not have the money to meet its agreement with Academic State Union of Universities, ASUU.”\nThe lawmaker, a former President of the National Union of Petroleum and Natural Gas Workers, NUPENG, said it was irresponsible on the part of the Federal Government to renege on its agreement with ASUU, describing as regrettable, the seeming insensitivity exhibited by government since the commencement of the ASUU strike.\nHe spoke in Benin City, shortly after the inauguration of Uneme National Development Association’s N100 million Education fund for Uneme communities. According to him, “It is very disheartening that up till now, ASUU is still on strike but unfortunately, I am not in a position to blame ASUU because I was still fully in Labour when this agreement was negotiated between ASUU and government.\n“So, it is irresponsible of anybody to enter into an agreement and then renege. It is totally unacceptable and that is the issue. It is unfortunate that a party has gone into an agreement and today, it is is saying that it has no resources to fund what it signed. Dr. Okonjo-Iweala is known for coming up with statements about inadequacy of funds but yet the entire revenue gates in the country are performing above estimation; customs, oil and gas industry, immigration, they are all doing well beyond what was anticipated, yet Okonjo- Iweala keeps deceiving Nigerians and the whole world that Nigeria does not have money.

I think there are better available options that can be employed to improve the situation of things. Prof. Itse Sagay’s advice to the federal government is the self-denial of the sad reality on the ground and an attempt to shift the goal post because he is in bed with the government of the day under whose watch the people are becoming a refugee in their country.\n“The government of the day has continued to renege on its obligation to fulfil its part of the social contract with the people”, arguing that “allowing individuals to take up arms as a means to protect themselves may result to anarchy, doom and national disaster in a country like ours where there is no adequate database for a proper background check, low level of awareness on mental evaluation and the unpredictable nature of Nigerians faced with so many uncertainties due to failure on the part of the APC/Buhari-led government.\n“With dwindling economic fortunes, hunger and increasing uncertainty in the land, allowing Nigerians to bears arms to defend themselves may just be the beginning of the end as this could lead to unnecessary bloodletting, reprisal attack, carnage and killing-spree because the majority of the people are angry and would be looking for every opportunity to let loose, which may result in an even worse scenario like we used to have in the United State”.\nHe, however, posited that restructuring and a declaration of national emergency on security was the way forward “if the government is sincere in its effort to address the challenges of insecurity currently threatening the very foundation of this country.\n“The way forward is restructuring and a rejig of the security architecture of the country, improved welfare packages for our security personnel, heavy investment on modern security gadget and equipment to boost the morale of the security personnel in combating criminal activities and a declaration of national emergency on security across the country”.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"https://www.vanguardngr.com/2020/12/insecurity-onuesoke-knocks-itsey-sagay-on-call-for-nigerians-to-bear-arms/","2":"566","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999904633"},{"0":"BREAKING: Imo Assembly bans protests\nBy Chris Njoku, Owerri\nThe Imo House of Assembly has banned any further protest in the state.\nIt warned protests have become dangerous events exposing residents to danger in Imo.\nThe Assembly also warned the PDP to stop crying wolf over the ruling of the Apex Court on Tuesday 14th January on the governorship election in the state.\nThe lawmakers also passed a vote of confidence on Governor Hope Uzondinma and the Supreme Court.","1":"https://thenationonlineng.net/breaking-imo-assembly-bans-protests/","2":"104","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999828339"},{"0":"Nigeria’s economy has continued to slump and has contracted for a fifth consecutive quarter in the three months through March as oil output declined, a Bloomberg report indicate.\nGross domestic product in Africa’s most populous nation, Nigeria shrank 0.5 percent in the first quarter from a year earlier, compared with a revised 1.7 percent contraction in the final three months of 2016, the Abuja-based National Bureau of Statistics said in an emailed statement on Tuesday.\nThe median of eight economist estimates compiled by Bloomberg was for the economy to expand by 0.3 percent.\nEconomy took a hit after oil prices crashed in mid-2014, and militants from the crude producing Niger Delta region destroyed pipelines causing production to fall to an almost three-decade low.\nThat and power shortages weighed down output, causing the GDP to shrink a revised 1.6 percent in 2016, the first full-year contraction in a quarter of a century. Foreign-currency shortages fueled by falling oil exports caused inflation to accelerate every month for more than a year until January.\nThe oil industry contracted 11.6 percent from a year earlier, the statistics office said.\nThe International Monetary Fund forecasts the economy will grow by 0.8 percent this year and the World Bank predicts expansion of 1.2 percent. The President Muhammadu Buhari-led government said recovery will be driven by a rebound in output of oil, which accounts for two-thirds of its revenue, as well as increased state spending.\nAlso, Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Mr. Ibe Kachikwu, Monday, vowed that he will ensure that Nigeria achieves self-sufficiency in crude oil refining in 2019, stating that he would resign if he fails to achieve the target.\nKachikwu declared that since assumption of office, the present administration had been able to improve the output of the refineries and that the refineries are currently undergoing refurbishment. He said, “Since coming we have been able to get them back to begin to produce 7 million litres versus zero.\nThat is not the 90 per cent template. We are now refurbishing the refineries.” Kachikwu further stated that he has delivered on every of his targets since coming into office and would not relent until all his targets are met. He said, “I have delivered on everything since I came to office. First, I took NNPC and moved them into a profit making organization; first time in history and reshaped the organization.\n“I removed cash call deficit of over $6 billion, negotiated it. Everything that I have promised since coming into office, I have delivered. I will deliver on the refineries and I am committed to that and I will also deliver a future for oil that makes sense for Nigeria. “But bear in mind one has been there for one and half years, the president has been there for two years. I can’t pretend that we are going to solve in one day all the problems that happened in Nigeria in the past.” Kachikwu further stated that sustained engagement had been the missing component in the Niger Delta militants challenges, noting that the Acting President Yemi Osinbajo is currently leading efforts in addressing the challenges.\nAlso, the central bank, which will announce its decision on interest rates later on Tuesday, has moved to improve foreign-currency liquidity by allowing portfolio investors to trade dollars at market determined rates and removing a 197-199 naira peg. The regulator still intervenes to keep the official interbank rate at about 315 per dollar and continues to block importers of certain products from accessing hard currency on the official market.\nSenate approved a 21 percent increase in 2017 spending plans to 7.4 trillion naira ($23.5 billion). The government plans to spend 30 percent of the budget to build roads, rail, ports and improve the power sector in order to stimulate business and create jobs.

We can’t afford to risk the life of Mr. President and somebody should be responsible.”\nDoctors, non-medical staff collect allowances\nAccording to the report presented by the State House Permanent Secretary to the committee, out of 329 personnel working in the State House Clinic, 47 non-core medical personnel for several years illegally collected call-duty allowances.\nIt alleged that some doctors sponsored by the State House to proceed on Residency programmes (usually two years), got their call duty allowances paid even when they were no longer performing call duties at the medical centre.\nThe Permanent Secretary told the lawmakers:“Sadly, some of them were discovered to have spent close to seven years doing residency, with many changing institutions, as they fail to qualify.\n“In view of the fact that paying doctors on sponsored training programme, call duty allowance was considered unearned allowances, IPPIS (OAGF) was advised to cease paying them such allowances, pending their return to duty from training.”\nThe Permanent Secretary also blamed 80 percent of the State House workers and their spouses for enjoying free medical services, despite their failure to enlist on the State House Clinic’s National Health Insurance Scheme, NHIS.\n“The State House reached an agreement with HMOs with regard to the remittance of all NHIS payments in respect of State House staff whose NHIS point is the State House Medical Centre.\n‘’It is instructive, however, to note that whereas almost 80% of the personnel serving in the State House access medical services at the State House Medical Centre, only about 20% of them selected the medical centre as their NHIS point.\n“The implication of the foregoing is that, whereas they access free medical services at the centre, their respective NHIS contributions go to those medical facilities they selected as their providers, even though they do not go there for any medical service.\n‘’This explains the quick depletion of the drugs and other consumables due to the very high number of patients being attached,” he said.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"https://www.vanguardngr.com/2017/11/aso-rock-clinic-cant-risk-buharis-life-reps/","2":"714","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999847412"},{"0":"Michael Titus Igweh\nIndonesia Friday executed four drug convicts, three of them foreigners, by firing squad, an official said, drawing swift condemnation from rights groups as Jakarta pushes on with its campaign of capital punishment.\nTen others expected to have faced the firing squad, including nationals from Pakistan, India and Zimbabwe as well as Indonesians, were not put to death but officials said they would be executed at a later stage.\nAuthorities did not give a reason for the reprieve, but the prison island where they were expected to be executed in outdoor clearings was hit by a major storm as the other sentences were carried out.\n“This was done not in order to take lives but to stop evil intentions, and the evil act of drug trafficking,” Noor Rachmad, deputy attorney general for general crimes, told reporters.\nHe added that “the rest (of the executions) will be carried out in stages”, saying that the timings had not yet been decided.\nAmnesty International condemned the executions with the group’s Rafendi Djamin labelling them “a deplorable act”.\n“Any executions that are still to take place must be halted immediately. The injustice already done cannot be reversed, but there is still hope that it won’t be compounded.”\nThe UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and the European Union had also voiced opposition to the plan in recent days.\nIt was the first round of executions in Indonesia since April last year when authorities put to death eight drug convicts, including two Australians, which sparked international outrage.\nFriday’s executions came after a day of frenetic activity, with distraught relatives travelling to Nusakambangan island to say farewells to their loved ones and ambulances carrying coffins over to the heavily guarded penal colony.\n– Execution drive –\nThe executed Indonesian was named as Freddy Budiman, while the three others, Nigerians, were: Seck Osmane, Humphrey Jefferson Ejike Eleweke and Michael Titus Igweh.\nEleweke’s lawyer, Afif Abdul Qoyim, told AFP the execution should not have gone ahead as his client this week filed a legal appeal.\n“When this process in not respected, that means that this is no longer a country that upholds the law, nor human rights,” he said.\nTwo people whose cases had raised high-profile international concern among rights groups were not executed.\nThe first was Pakistani Zulfiqar Ali, whom rights groups say was beaten into confessing to the crime of heroin possession, leading to his 2005 death sentence.\nSyed Zahid Raza, the deputy Pakistani ambassador in Indonesia, hailed his reprieve as a victory and said it was due to diplomatic efforts in Jakarta and Islamabad.\nThe other was Indonesian woman Merri Utami, who was caught with heroin in her bag as she came through Jakarta airport and claims she was duped into becoming a drug mule.\nAt Cilacap, the city closest to Nusakambangan, family members were initially shocked to learn on Thursday morning their relatives would be executed in a matter of hours, having initially thought it would take place a day later.\nSome distressed relatives protested their loved ones’ innocence, while 10 women’s rights activists rallying in support of Utami were detained.\nIt was the third batch of executions under President Joko Widodo, and means 18 drug convicts — mostly foreigners — have been put to death since he became leader in 2014.\nWidodo has defended dramatically ramping up the use of capital punishment, saying that Indonesia is fighting a war on drugs and traffickers must be heavily punished.\nBut his execution drive has shocked the international community and disappointed activists, particularly as hopes were high that Widodo, seen as a fresh face in a political world dominated by figures from Indonesia’s authoritarian past, would improve the country’s rights record.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"http://www.vanguardngr.com/2016/07/condemnation-indonesia-executes-osmane-eleweke-igweh/","2":"841","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999408722"},{"0":"No railway coaches stolen, says NRC MD\nThe Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC) has announced that the first set of coaches which was alleged to have been stolen from its Maiduguri yard actually got to its Jos, Plateau State running shed for general repair on October 10, 2023.\nA statement by the Nigerian Railway Corporation Fidet Okhiria on Sunday, stated that the viral video purported to have emanated from NTA had alleged that police had intercepted some criminals trying to steal a train coach at the Maiduguri Railway Station.\nOkhiria, who spoke exclusively with The Nation from China, said the coach in question was actually heading to Jos for repair ahead of its deployment on the rail corridor to enhance the Mass Transit Train Shuttle (MTTS), which is meant to help alleviate the impact of the fuel subsidy removal on the masses.\nHe said the RDM Maiduguri in a photograph was seen successfully handing over the coaches to his Jos counterpart when the coach got to its destination last week.\nThe statement reads: “The attention of the Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC) has been drawn to a news trending on numerous social media platforms purported to have emanated from Nigerian Television Authority (NTA), in which it was reported that an attempt was made to steal NRC coaches from Maiduguri.\n“NRC management wishes to clarify this erroneous reportage by stating that the said coaches are officially being moved to NRC running shed in Jos, Plateau State to be overhauled and putting them back to operation.

But six months later, the signs began to manifest.\nThe state of her health then may have spured her parents to name her Favour – a gift bestowed as a token of goodwill, kind regard, love by God.\nBut, today, Favour is struck with a strange eye disease which medical doctors at the Nnamdi Azikiwe University Teaching Hospital, Nnewi, confirmed to be congenital glaucoma.\nPresently, Favour with bulging of the right eye which is now affecting the left eye, further medical examination revealed that the baby has cancer of the eye.\nAccording to her doctors, if there is no urgent medical intervention, poor Favour will lose her both eyes.\nThe parents have been going from pillar to post, looking for solution but all efforts to help baby Favour have proved abortive.\nAll the way from Onitsha, her mother, Blessing Adam came to Lagos recently in search of a miracle that could help transform the condition of her baby girl.\nThe 28-year-old mother was advised to seek further solution in a faith based institution by a friend. So, she went to the TB Joshua’s Synagogue church of all nations in Lagos.\nAccording to her, “I went to TB Joshua’s church on Wednesday and waited patiently for me to be called upon but all expectations failed.\n“Unfortunately, it was not the time for cancer patients. So, I left and went back the following day. Again, my baby’s name was not called. So, I felt bad and left because I did not want my baby to die.\n“I was in a bus when a good Samaritan man saw the condition of the baby and advised that I should go to Vanguard that I must surely get help.\n“I am a petty trader and my husband drives a hired Keke Marwa. We both live in Onitsha but we are a native of Uyo, Akwa-Ibom State.\n“I did not know anywhere in Lagos but with the help of the man, I was able to locate Vanguard premises”, she added.\nNarrating the sorry tales of her baby’s health, she said, “Favour started scratching her eyes when she was six months old.\n“At first, I never envisaged it was a serious issue. So, I did not take her to the hospital immediately, but took her to nearby Chemist shop and the man advised that, I should apply eye drops and give her some Vitamin C syrup which I did.\n“Unfortunately, there was no changes in her as the day goes by, so, I stopped the eye drops and the drug. Then, I sought help elsewhere. I then started going from one church to another just to get help.\n“A pastor told me that it was a spiritual problem and that it can only be tackled with prayers. So, I started going from one church to another. And since the incident, I had gone to seven different churches but all efforts were to no avail.\n“After a while, my husband advised that I should take her to University of Calabar Teaching Hospital and there I was told that her eyes were already damaged and it will be removed.\n“The doctor said, an operation will be carried out on the girl but I do not know the cost of the operation. I was scared because I did not want my baby’s eyes to be removed, so I left.\n“Although, the doctor said removing the eyes will help save the life of the baby but I do not agree that her eyes should be removed.\n“Before taking her to University of Calabar Teaching Hospital, I had gone to Guinness hospital, Onitsha where I was given some drugs. But, there was no changes. I was then given a letter to go to Nnewi for laboratory test.\n“Unfortunately, we are financially incapacitated so, I could not go for the laboratory test as quickly as possible as prescribed. But, when we finally went, it was also discovered that she is having cancer of the eye.\nSince, the incident, the baby has been passing through severe pain. She cannot sleep at night. I only carry her on my back everyday and night. She cries so much such that she hardly sleep at night. Her siblings, a boy and a girl are presently at Onitsha”, she lamented.\nAsked, if there was any history of eye problem in her family, she said, “My mother-in-law has eye problem. My husband told me it was witchcraft that caused her eye problem.\nWhen Saturday Vanguard contacted Namdi Azikwe University Teaching hospital on the issue, Professor Onyekwe who is in charge of the case, disclosed to this reporter that an ‘Filteration surgeryof the eye’ will have to be carried out urgently to stop the enlargement of the cancer.\nHe stated that the surgery which will take place at Guiness Eye centre, Nnewi, Anambra state will cost the sum of N100,000.\nRight now, the mother is calling on well meaning Nigerians to help baby Favour stay alive.

During an interview for the newspaper O Estado de S. Paulo, in between a conversation about Disneyland and sports cars, he was asked if he had ever experienced racism. “Never. Not in the field, nor outside of it,” he replied.\n“It’s not like I’m black, you know?”\nHis answer was heard like a record-scratch across the country. Was this young man in denial about his racial identity? Particularly when in the same interview he outlined his meticulous hair care regime, which involved getting his locks chemically straightened every few weeks, then bleached blonde.\nOr was there a less alarming explanation behind his comment? Could Neymar merely be pointing out that, as the son of a black father and a white mother, his lighter skin tone shielded him from the racist abuse directed at other players? Had he, at least in his context, reached whiteness? Whatever the interpretation, Neymar’s words revealed the tricky, often contradictory ways that many Brazilians talk, and fail to talk, about race in a country with the largest population of black descendants outside of Africa.\nWhen audiences tune in to watch Brazil play, they are treated to a rich spectrum of skin tones flashing vibrantly across the screen. The racial makeup of the Brazilian squad, in fact, generally reflects the demographics of the country. According to 2017 data released by the census department, 47 percent of Brazilians identify as mixed-race, while another 8 percent identify as black. One third of marriages happen across racial boundaries. Such numbers confirm the common belief held by Brazilians, and the millions of international travelers who visited last year, that the country is a racially fluid society.\nUnlike the national team, however, the upper echelons of most professions in Brazil — be it medicine, media, business, entertainment or government — are occupied by whites. The nation’s raw demographic data paints an accurate portrait of a diverse people; yet it also adds patina to the old myth, promoted for generations by the government and first intellectualized by sociologists nearly a century ago, that Brazil is a democracia racial, or “racial democracy.”","1":"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/30/opinion/is-neymar-black-brazil-and-the-painful-relativity-of-race.html","2":"542","3":"Sports","4":"2","5":"en","6":"0.9999599457"},{"0":"•Resurgence of suicide attacks political — Middle Belt Forum\nBy Peter Duru & Ibrahim Hassan-Wuyo\nUntil last Saturday, the country had forgotten that suicide bombers once held the northern part of the country hostage.

How will our people cope with poor leadership, hunger in every home and every city with the fear of suicide bombers also.\nThe Federal Government and our security agencies must triple their effort before citizens are pushed to the wall.\nA hungry man is known to be an angry man but what will happen if his anger and hunger are further threatened by serious security threats? Northern Elders and religious leaders must also come out to mobilize the people to support government and security agencies to fight evil in the region. We should not only be specialists in mobilizing our people to vote for the candidates of our choice during elections and not mobilizing them to double their efforts to make our region safe and peaceful.\nNorthern Youths should not only form associations to attack political opponents of their favorite candidates, they should be seen and heard to be exposing evil elements amongst them and helping government and security agencies to track down sponsors and promoters of the evil that is ravaging our region.”\nGwoza incidents shattered our hope —Shettima\nSimilarly, Alhaji Yerima Shettima, the President General of Arewa Youth Consultative Forum ( AYFC), said “suicide bombing has been a devastating and horrifying tactic used by extremist groups for many years, causing tremendous loss of life and spreading fear and uncertainty in communities around the world.\nIn recent years, many believed that suicide bombing was becoming less prevalent, as security measures and counter-terrorism efforts seemed to be making progress in preventing such attacks. However, the last incident in Gwosa, Bornu state, shattered hope when multiple suicide attacks occurred, leaving more than 30 people dead and many others injured. Suicide attacks not only disrupt the daily lives of residents but also hampers economic growth and development in the affected areas.\nBusinesses may be reluctant to invest in regions prone to suicide bombings, leading to unemployment and poverty among the population. In the long term, this can contribute to social unrest and instability, creating a vicious cycle that perpetuates the conditions conducive to terrorism. In addition to addressing the immediate security concerns, Northern leaders and elders must also focus on long-term solutions to permanently discourage suicide bombing.\nBuilding resilience within communities and promoting social cohesion are key factors in preventing individuals from being radicalized and recruited by extremist groups.\nThis can be achieved through grassroots initiatives that empower local leaders, religious figures, and community organizations to promote tolerance, inclusivity, and peaceful coexistence. By fostering a sense of belonging and identity, communities can become more resistant to the influence of extremist ideologies.”\nResurgence of suicide bombings in Gwoza political —MBF\nOn its part, the Middle Belt Forum, MBF, has alleged that the recent Gwoza suicide bombings in Borno State could have political undertone. The National President of MBF, Dr. Bitrus Pogu noted that the fact the incident came when efforts were in top gear by the Federal Government to return the over 120,000 Gwoza indigenes taking refuge in neighbouring Cameroon created much room for suspicion.\nHis words: “On the Gwosa suicide bombings I can tell you that up till now there are a lot of the insurgents on top of the Gwoza hills who have not been flushed out. The fight against insurgency is being stalled by political interests who put pressure on military commanders not to do anything. And these boys are from one particular tribe mainly, they are called Duwhade and the majority of them are butchers. It is the people from this tribe that are mainly insurgents on top of the Mandara mountains which is an extension of the Gwoza hills. Because of insurgency, as we are talking, about 120,000 people from Gwoza Local Government, mainly behind the hills have found refuge in Cameroon as refugees.\nThere are serious efforts, especially when this government came on board, to bring these people back to their ancestral land as promised by the President. But some political interests, who believe that the people will not vote for them because they are predominantly Christians, do not want them to return home. And I believe they are creating this unnecessary insecurity through attacks and suicide bombings so that these people will not be brought back to Nigeria to their ancestral land.\n“So the political leaders particularly the Governor and the Senator from Southern Borno should explain why these things are happening at a time when there is objection to the coming back of the people for political reason. Efforts to bring back IDPs and refugees to their ancestral homes by the Federal Government are being undermined and I believe that what has happened in Gwoza was purely political.\n“On the issue of suicide bombings, I don’t believe somebody would blow himself up because of religion, no. I believe the criminals would tie explosives on the people and tell them you either do what we have directed you to do or we deal with you and the victims would go in fear and somebody somewhere may be the one detonating the bombs. So, it may not be that the bomb carrier wanted to commit suicide and blow others up”.\nThe terrorists merely went underground to regroup — Anthony Sani\nFormer Secretary General of the Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF), Mr Anthony NZ Sani, said “the resurgence of suicide bombing in Borno state underscores the fact that the immediate past administration merely tamed the terrorists but did not exterminate them permanently. As a result, they merely went underground to regroup.\nThis resurgence also vindicates the view that military might alone cannot exterminate terrorism permanently. Only by addressing the underlying causes can we permanently put them to rest.\nThe causes are poverty which comes with ignorance and unemployment. So, to defeat terrorism permanently, the government should apply both punitive and preventive measures. The punitive measure is the provision of enough and properly equipped security personnel who are well motivated to secure the nation while the preventive measure is the prioritization of education and health of the people.\nThis is because the current out-of-school children, if left unchecked would become terrorists of tomorrow. This requires a long-term commitment from all stakeholders, including governments, civil society, and the private sector, to address the root causes of terrorism and extremism and build a more peaceful and prosperous future for all.”\nEconomic opportunities provide viable alternatives to joining extremist groups —Northern Elders Forum\nAlso, Mallam Suleiman Abdul-Azeez of the Northern Elders Forum (NEF), said, “This alarming trend has reignited concerns among Northern leaders and elders, who recognize the urgent need to address the root causes of suicide bombing and the general and pervasive insecurity to prevent future attacks.\nThe attacks in Gwosa have highlighted the need for improved coordination among law enforcement agencies, intelligence services, and military forces in detecting and preventing such attacks.\nI believe one of the key factors driving suicide bombings in the region is the lack of economic opportunities and widespread poverty.\nMany of the individuals recruited by terrorist groups are motivated by financial incentives or promises of a better life. To combat this, it is essential to create sustainable economic development opportunities that provide viable alternatives to joining extremist groups.\nImproving security and intelligence capabilities is another crucial aspect of addressing the threat of suicide bombing. Furthermore, it is important to strengthen border security to prevent the infiltration of terrorist groups and the smuggling of weapons and explosives. Fostering community resilience is also essential in preventing future attacks.\nThis involves building trust between communities and security forces, as well as empowering local leaders and organizations to play a proactive role in countering extremism.\nBy promoting dialogue and cooperation among different ethnic and religious groups, communities can become more resilient to the divisive tactics of terrorist groups. Engaging with religious leaders and institutions can be a powerful tool in combating the misuse of religion for extremist purposes.\nInterfaith dialogue and collaboration among different religious communities can also foster mutual understanding and respect, strengthening social harmony and countering divisive ideologies.\nPromoting social cohesion is another important strategy in preventing the spread of extremism. By addressing underlying grievances and promoting inclusivity and tolerance, it is possible to reduce the appeal of extremist ideologies.\nBy working together to address the complex and interconnected challenges posed by suicide bombing, Northern leaders and elders can help create a safer, more secure, and more prosperous future for their communities.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"https://www.vanguardngr.com/2024/07/return-of-suicide-bombers-were-back-to-our-worst-nightmare-northern-leaders-lament/","2":"1960","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999427795"},{"0":"By Dele Sobowale\n“Justice Mohammad Idris of a Federal High Court in Lagos has ordered President Muhammadu Buhari to hold all successive administrations since the return to civil rule in 1999 to account on the spending of the recovered loot” – a national newspaper.\nAre you aware that in addition to the four refineries in Nigeria – Portharcourt I and II, Warri and Kaduna, this country also had a 30 per cent interest in West African Refinery, Sierra Leone which was handed over to President Obasanjo’s government in 1999? Are you also aware that has Obasanjo so far failed to account for that national assets and its disposal, he was handed a list of assets forfeited by Abacha to the Federal Government on May 26, 1999 – in the last decree –Decree No. 53 – which was the last signed by General Abdulsalami Abubakar as Head of State, Commander-In-Chief of the Armed Forces, Federal Republic of Nigeria? Are you also aware that other Abacha loot, returned between 1999 and May 2007, when Obasanjo was forced to step aside, remain unaccounted for and might have been re-looted? Prepare yourself for a shock – if it is still possible to be shocked in Nigeria by anything done by leaders of the PDP who had access to the corridors of power – especially the self-righteous Obasanjo. His administration established the template for looting Abacha loot. But, permit first a diversion – a necessary one.\nObasanjo had since made a caustic comment about the court order. He called Justice Idris “stupid” for daring to ask Buhari to ask Obasanjo to account for OUR money and other assets. That shows Obasanjo in his true colours. A honest man if asked to account for other peoples property which he held in trust does not resort to abuse. He would open the records for all to see that he had integrity. But, not Obasanjo. It is in his character. Back on April 8, 2012, three individuals who knew Baba Iyabo better than most Nigerians had the following to say about the man.\nFirst, former Senate President Ken Nnamani: “He personally authorized the disbursement of N50m each for 109 Senators, as well as other sums of money, which amounted to an excess of N8bn to pass the third term bill into law.”\nThen, Honourable Femi Gbajabiamila: “He spent over N10bn on the agenda. His aides came to me to solicit support for third term. He also attempted to enlist the support of a former US President, Mr Bush, for the project, but it failed.”\nFinally, read what Honourable Halims Agoda had to say. “It was Obasanjo’s personal agenda. He sought the support of the National Assembly, but it was thrown out..”. In the front page report of a national newspaper on the day under reference, titled “Obasanjo a joker, liar, he was behind third term – Nnamani, others”, Nigerians and the entire world were presented with the man Obasanjo. From what Nnamani alleged, he was involved in bribery and corruption – spending funds whose sources were undisclosed. Readers will begin to get an idea of where the money came from by reading my book – PDP: CORRUPTION INCORPORATED. Obasanjo created the PDP as we know it today. Jonathan just took the party to the next level.\nNow, let us examine some indisputable evidence to support Justice Idris’ call on Buhari to ask Obasanjo and others to account for our resources. Please notice the word “resources” because what is missing is more than money – as will soon be demonstrated shortly.\nDecree No 53, as earlier stated was the last decree signed by General Abubakar, who after it was placed in the Gazette, wanted it withdrawn for reasons still unknown. A desperate but failed effort was made to retrieve all the copies. Consequently, few copies of the Decree are in existence and most people are not aware of it. Among the few is available at Unijankara kept under lock and key. Below however is the summary of all the assets forfeited to the Federal Government of Nigeria under the FORFEITURE OF ASSETS, ETC. (CERTAIN PERSONS) DECREE 1999.\nProperties/Assets Belonging To Late General Sani Abacha.\nPlot 135(A6), House No. 12, Zaire Crescent, Maitama; Plot 574 (A4), Yakubu Gowon Crescent near ECOWAS Secretariat, Asokoro; Plot 2824 (A6), Block No. 17, along Danube Street, Maitama; Plot 650 (A6), Rhine Street, Maitama; Plot 1487 (A4), Justice Mamman Nasir Street; Plot 2480 (A6) Alvan Ikoku Street, Maitama; Plot 636 Adeyemo Alakija Street, Victoria Island (Cowry House).\nFinally, 30 per cent shares valued at $420,000 USD, in West African Refinery, Sierra Leone (Purchased from UNIPETROL).\nIn addition to the properties listed there were the following cash items: $625,263,187.19; 75,306,886.93 pounds sterling and N100,000,000. In those days with the US dollar exchanging for N130 per dollar and a pound fetching N250, the total Abacha loot alone Abubakar handed to Obasanjo’s government was about N100 billion. That was just from the first set of loot found in Nigeria. Wait util next week to find out how much was forfeited by Abacha’s National Security Adviser, Ismaila Gwarzo, Mohammed Abacha, Abdulkadir Abacha, Alhaji Bashir Dalhatu and Chief Tony Ani. Then you will begin to understand why Obasanjo does not want a probe of the Abacha loot…..\nNEXT WEEK: “If he [Obasanjo] is claiming that he never initiated the idea, who then initiated the release of more than N8bn from CBN coffers? Is it not the President that has access to CBN vaults?” Senate President, Ken Nnamani. Raiding CBN by Presidents pre-dated Jonathan. Baba started the civilian version in 1999.\nCBN GOVERNOR: CIVIL SOCIETY GROUPS ARE BLAMING THE VICTIM.\n“Be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as snow, thou shalt not escape calumny.”\nWilliam Shakespeare, 1564-1616. (VANGUARD BOOK OF QUOTES).\nIf there is one public official who has earned my total sympathy these days, it is the Governor of Central Bank, CBN. There must be occasions, these days, when poor Mr Godwin Emefiele must be asking if there aren’t easier ways to make a living. Personally, I admire his guts, his tenacity, his patriotism and his courage under the constant bombardment of attacks – mostly defamatory. If he is not accused of selling dollars to unnamed beneficiaries below official rate, he accused of conducting secret recruitment unknown to the Presidency. All the critics, without exception argue from narrow perspectives of the CBN’s challenges and options available. They are like so many blind men each holding a part of an elephant and thinking he knows what an elephant is. Nobody has offered a comprehensive alternative to what he is doing.\nYet, I can state authoritatively that if there is any official most closely watched by government, it is the CBN Governor. He had made no important decision without approval from Aso Rock. Those asking for his sack are wasting their time. Bet on it. The guy is smart.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"http://www.vanguardngr.com/2016/04/how-obasanjos-govt-looted-abacha-loot/","2":"1712","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999389648"},{"0":"Boko Haram fighters\nBY NDAHI MARAMA, MAIDUGURI\nSuspected members of dreaded Boko Haram Sect on Saturday evening invaded Ajiri village of Mafa Local Government Area of Borno state and wrecked havoc, leading to destruction of lives and properties.

We cried to the security agencies but nothing was done. Now the attackers have made it a daily attack. Since the last ten days, we have recovered at least 26 bodies from the various communities attacked by the insurgents.”\nThe insurgents numbering about 400, allegedly divided themselves into 3 groups and are attacking the villages from all directions.\nIn a statement released by the BYM yesterday in Jos and signed by the acting national chairman of the BYM, Mr Rwang Dantong reads, “We wish to, on behalf of the entire Berom Youths, condemn in strong term the persistent and systematic attacks on Bachi district of Riyom local government council by Fulani herdsmen.\n“This is an open declaration of war on Berom people for no justifiable reason.\n“These consistent attacks have been going on daily, since the 2nd of October. Within the period, the gunmen have attacked at least ten villages killing 26 people. The villages are Lwa, Shonong, Fang, Dum, Chengye, Rakweng, Diyan, Rachi and Sharbutu.\n“The casualties so far are; 7 killed in Lwa, 3 killed in Fang, 2 killed in Dum, 3 killed in Sharbutu, 2 STF staff killed, 1 killed in Chengye, 6 killed in Shonong, 1 killed in Rachi.\n“Among those killed was a pregnant woman in Lwa village who was expected to be wedded in a week time. Over 60 houses were burnt in the attack including that of late Senator Gyang Dantong. 20 houses were burnt down in Lwa village including a Church Pastorium.\n“It is quite worrisome that the insurgents have been identified as the Fulani herdsmen that are living within our communities. They launched the attacks and get back to their homes unharmed. The next day they would go to attack yet another village. It is an organized ethnic cleansing of the Berom tribe.\n“We can only cry out to the federal government to come to the rescue of our people and stop these attacks on innocent citizens. We are also calling on the special task force to rise up to the occasion and restore peace immediately.\n“There is the need to chase out these terrorists from our communities if peace must return to the areas, the gunmen have killed 26 people in 10 days of consistent attack.\n“We commend the executive chairman of Riyom local government, Hon. Mrs. Josephine Piyo for constantly mobilizing security agencies to the scene of attacks. We therefore called on all stakeholders to join hands with the council boss to chase these terrorists out of our communities.\nFew months ago, the Berom youths raised alarm that they had discovered training camps of some insurgents in Riyom Local governments. The youths called on security agencies for help over alleged plans by armed Fulani militants to launch fresh attacks on some lists of villages.\nThe concerned villagers said they have discovered a training camp of unknown gunmen behind a rocky hill in Rim near Riyom.\nAccording to the villagers, “The alarm became necessary so as to attract security agencies to come to our aid in protection, the whole of Bachit district is under serious risk of gunmen attack if nothing is done to improve security surveillance in the areas”\nA member of a vigilante group in Riyom Dangyang Bulus said, “We discovered their plans because one of the Fulani living with us was invited to join them in their training camp, that one deceived them by telling them he would go home and prepare to join them later but refused to go back to the camp.\n“So it is our Fulani neighbour that revealed the secret to us, we have communicated to the police and security agencies in charge of these areas, but from all indication, they are afraid of going there, some of them even said we are raising false alarm.\n“These gunmen can strike anytime and we don’t know where and when they will strike. That is why we are raising this alarm. If this planned attack is not prevented, we will hold the security agencies responsible for any loss of lives and properties because, past attacks by these gunmen, recorded as much as hundred casualties,” said Bulus.\nA copy of a petition sent to Plateau state police commissioner by members of Shonong community, indicated that several of their men have been killed while working on their farms last month. The petitioned signed by Shonong Youth leader, Yohanna Ciroma described the situation in the area as silent terrorism, saying our communities has been under siege by armed Fulani men.”\nA member representing Riyom constituency at the Plateau state house of assembly, Hon Daniel Dem also confirmed the danger his people are facing.\n“However, the security agencies failed to rise up to the danger. The gunmen are now all over the villagers, attacking and killing them both day and night unhindered. Two soldiers serving with the special task force has been killed so far in the renewed attacks by the insurgents.”\nHon Dem while commenting on the insecurity in his constituency said, “This is an act of terrorism against my people, they can no longer go to farms because they are consistently been attacked by suspected Fulani herds men”\nHon Dem said, “The fulanis come into our farmland and will deliberately lead their cattle to graze on crops, if you complain you are killed instantly.\n“Close to seven of my constituency have been killed in Rim village of Riyom in the past two weeks by our attackers on their farms. This has forced them to abandon their farm lands.”\nDem who is also the Majority leader of the state house of assembly further alleged that some security operatives must be aiding some of their attackers. He wondered why men of the Special Task Force deployed in the area could not stop the attackers.\n“In most of the villages attacked, there was presence of men of the STF. Why are they not going after the attackers? Hon Dem asked.\nThe lawmaker called on security operatives to wake up to their responsibilities of protecting citizens of the locality. In Lwa village, an expectant mother was killed along with her four children. Names of the children are; Meriamu Jonathan age 25, Sandra Jonathan, 13, Agnes Jonathan, 10 and Goodluck Jonathan, aged 6.\nOther known victims killed in Fang village are Pam Kube, 23, Sgt. Musa Sanda (STF soldier), Dalyop Joro, 41, Emmanuel Danyam, 14, Stepehen Danjuma, 11.\nThose killed in Bachi are; Laraba Sunday Bwede, 60, Geoffrey Solomon Choji, 13, Mrs Jummai Daida Long, 66, Rhoda Luka Bwede, 17, Danjuma Bitrus, 39, Mathew Tiga, 34 and Mary Dauda, 56.In Bangai village, Emmanuel Dachung, 34.\nAs at the time of sending this report, other affected villages are busy compiling names of their people killed in all the attacks.\nSpokesman of the special task force, Captain Ikedichi Iweka however could not confirm casualty figures but said, “a member of the troop was killed by the insurgents. He also said men of the STF have already taken control of the battle ground and peace has been restored in the villages”.\nAccording to Capt Iweha, “The attack is a reprisal kind of attack, it followed cow rustling, when people kill cows: the cow owners will stage revenge. But we have taken control, and we have restored normalcy. But stakeholders should be advised against giving exaggerated casualty figures, as doing so, will amount to sabotaging our peace efforts.”\n“The casualty figures given in that statement of Berom is exergerated, there are 13 deaths and we have stopped further attacks and killings. If not for our intervention,t the situation should have been worse.","1":"http://thenationonlineng.net/new/26-killed-80-houses-razed-in-plateau-fresh-attacks/","2":"1773","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9992411733"},{"0":"How 2020 NBA elections were manipulated, by Adesina\nBy Robert Egbe\nA candidate in the 2020 Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) presidential election, Mr Dele Adesina SAN, Monday shed light on his claim that the process was manipulated.\nAdesina renewed a call he made last week for the cancellation of the poll, in a letter to the NBA’s Board of Trustees Chairman, Dr Olisa Agbakoba.\nHis allegations were however refuted by outgoing NBA President Paul Usoro.\nFormer NBA Secretary-General Adesina and his brother Silk Dr Babatunde Ajibade last Thursday lost the race for the NBA Presidency to a non-SAN, Mr Olumide Akpata.\nAkpata will succeed Usoro SAN later this month.\nBut in his petition seen by The Nation, Adesina alleged that the election was marred by over-voting, disenfranchisement of some eligible voters, and non-compliance with the provisions of the NBA constitution.\nAccording to him, the voters register verified by the Electoral Committee of NBA (ECNBA) was found to be “manipulated, doctored and padded”.\nAdesina said the register contained “4,464 names of purported Lawyers without Branches ascribed to any of them from Serial Number 25171 to 29635. This List obviously provided cover for harvested voters without Branches;\n“86 names of Lawyers (were) under the category ‘International Diaspora’ from Serial Number 12182 to 12268, a clear violation of the provisions of the Constitution of the NBA. International Diaspora as a Branch is unknown to the NBA Constitution.”\nHe alleged that there were cases of inflation of the list of some Branches, including “For instance, Obollo-Afor Branch had only 39 names from Serial Number 30424 to 30462 on the Final List for Verification. Strangely, this increased to 662 on the Verified Voters List published on the date of the Election.”\nAccording to him, there was also deletion/removal of names of many members from the final list. “For example: Ikeja, Ibadan, Enugu, Ife, Ado-Ekiti and many others had their number of voters substantially reduced without any explanation whatsoever or howsoever,” Adesina said.\nIn another instance, he alleged that the voting site had predetermined election data.\nHe added: “A close examination of the recorded result at different timelines shows percentage movement of the Presidential Candidates as 54%, 23% and 21% with little or no variation.\n“The system was obviously programmed to distribute votes at either +1 or 1 throughout the 24-hour period.\n“Besides, about forty percent of voters could not vote as they were not sent with the links to do so. Again, ECNBA admitted this fact by stating that notices were delivered in batches what ought to be delivered at once to all prospective voters.\n“Out of about 29,000 prospective voters, about 14,000 were not able to vote by the reasons stated above. As if that is not enough, instead of the recorded system stating that Mr. Olumide Akpata leads by 54% barely from about 20 minutes after voting started, the system stated that Olumide Akpata is winning by 54% in order to hoodwink and bias the mind of the voters in an election that is supposed to be free and fair.”\nHowever, Usoro, in a memo last month to NBA Past Presidents & Trustees, refuted some of the allegations in Adesina’s letter.\nUsoro said: “To reinforce the explanations in the ECNBA Statement No. 19, I further explained to Mr. Adesina that (a) all the names in the Verified Voters’ List were drawn from the Final Voters’ List that was published by the ECNBA on 01 July 2020 and that no new names were added;\n“(b) all the names in the Verified Voters’ List are lawyers and had paid their Bar Practicing Fees and Branch Dues and had therefore met the eligibility qualification to vote in the Elections;\n“and (c) the Elections would be determined, not on the basis of NBA branches but based on universal suffrage of the members which is the voting system enshrined in the Nigerian Bar Association Constitution, 2015 (as amended) and we should therefore not be fixated on the electronic glitches that assigned wrong branches to members.\n“I stand by those explanations…”\nHe added: “It is strange that Mr. Adesina claims that there were members ‘who received the link’ but ‘could not vote’. The overwhelming evidence that I received and also read on social media was to the effect that the voting process was ‘seamless’ and very easy for our members. I have so far not received any report from any member claiming that he or she had challenges in voting on the basis of the unique link that were sent to members from and by the Election Platform server.”","1":"https://thenationonlineng.net/how-2020-nba-elections-were-manipulated-by-adesina/","2":"1069","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999885559"},{"0":"By Kingsley Omonobi\nPresident General Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide Ambassador George Obiozo has commended the Nigerian Army for its role in restoring peace to South East Region.\nHe made the commendation in Enugu when he hosted the General Officer Commanding 82 Division, Maj Gen Taoreed Lagbaja on a courtesy visit on Wednesday.\nAmbassador Obiozo expressed his delight for the visit saying “without peace nations cannot progress and without the Armed Forces, we will have more problems.

The joke is told of how a machine that catches thieves was invented outside these coasts. That machine was dispatched to us to help catch those big thieves around.\nBut as soon as the machine landed in Nigeria, it was stolen! Does this sound any different from what is happening to the Direct Data Capture (DDC) machines, which were imported into this country to facilitate the process of registering us to vote?\nAs soon as the machines arrived Nigeria, they developed wings and began to escape in every direction. We hear that some of the stolen machines have been recovered but what happened to the rest? The theft of even one unit of such sensitive machines should, ordinarily, be treated as high treason, except that in Nigeria, we have since learnt to treat everything with levity.\nApart from the financial gains accruing to the thieves who stole the machines, we are pained by the bigger dent involved in a botched 2011 election, even before take off. While genuine Nigerians will be struggling in the field, under the sun and in the rain, trying to get registered, some will be doing dubious parallel registrations, the Adedibu style, in their private homes. And we still think we are conducting a credible election?\nHow many things do we really do well in this country? This is a country where we can’t even count ourselves. Every ten years, we go into the expensive war of the census at the end of which we come out with some bogus population figures in some areas; while the figures in some other areas remain politically suppressed. See what is happening to Lagos with its burgeoning population?\nEveryone sees and feels it but the book-keepers tell us otherwise. Such hated areas must go to court to be able to get a pinch of justice on every issue, ranging from the allocation to the local governments to other minor issues. We hear that the Federal Government still went ahead to withhold the legitimate entitlements of the local governments of Edo, Ekiti and Ondo States.\nOur Federal Government has not learnt any lessons from the illegal withholding of the allocations to the local governments of Lagos State during the Obasanjo years. It is unfortunate that in its dealings with other federating units, the Federal Government is less than transparent and it cuts corners at every bend.\nEven on such a simple issue as the definition of our Financial Year, the Federal Government is unsure of itself. Not too long ago, the Financial Year in Government circles used to be from 1st April of one year to the 31st of March of the following year.\nThis was changed to 1st January – 31st December of every year. The change here, notwithstanding, we see our Federal Government gradually adopting a new Financial Year from the 1st of January of one year to the 31st of March of the following year.\nThis practice started with the implementation of the 2009 appropriation Act. We were all busy watching over the health of our late President that we did not know when “one flew over the coo coo’s nest”. Before we were fairly aware of what was happening, 2009 had passed and we had hardly started implementing the year’s budget. It was therefore convenient to announce that the 2009 appropriations would be implemented up to 31st March, 2010. Evidently, one bad turn deserves another.\nThe Federal Government has just announced that the 2010 appropriations will be implemented into March 2011. Perhaps unwittingly, we have been pushed into a 15-month Financial Year.\nThat’s what indolence and tardiness can do. Because a lazy executive branch of government has failed to submit the budget proposals to a lazy legislative branch at the appropriate time; the lazy legislature cannot pass the budget on time; and the end result is that spending on that budget cannot begin in earnest until much later in the Financial Year.\nWhat a chain reaction! As we approach the Election Year, it is clear that the entire machinery of government will soon migrate into the campaign fields and governance will be put in abeyance.\nWe continue to wonder if ours is still a federation. A situation in which the Federal Government has so much to eat, to waste, to steal and to throw around while the other federating units that really need the money for true development are being starved is most undesirable, to say the least.\nYet, the Revenue Allocation formula that we now have in place is as outdated as the National Minimum Wage Act. The last time that both measures were given any meaningful touch was during the Shagari Administration, in the Second Republic. This is one fertile area where an accountable National Assembly would have been busy, trying to remedy things.\nThe bubble will soon burst. Right now, the Nigerian workers are making us an offer that we cannot refuse. They are awaiting the national minimum wage of N18,000 per month and our legislators will not have the moral justification to turn it down.\nBut against the backdrop that many States have not been able to implement the N7,500 per month requirement, we wonder what magic they will apply to the N18,000 measures. This is the time to revisit the Revenue Allocation formula, which for the States, could be the last key in the bunch to open the door.\nThe Federal Government is still swimming in the illegal excess crude account, which the Supreme Court has since outlawed, asking that the balance of the account be transferred to the Federation Account for better coordination. Even at that, we have been insisting that the operation of the Federation Account itself leaves much to be desired.\nWhat we have today as the Accountant-General of the Federation is a misnomer. He is, indeed, the Accountant-General of the Federal Government. For now, the Federation Account remains what the Federal Government says it is. The only way to avoid this is to establish a General Accounting Office (GAO) for the federation in which case, a truly separate Accountant-General of the Federation is simply imperative.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"https://www.vanguardngr.com/2022/02/gunmen-kidnap-11-council-workers-in-abia-demand-n25m-ransom/amp/This","2":"1257","3":"Politics","4":"2","5":"en","6":"0.9999904633"},{"0":"By Clifford Ndujihe\nDebatably, Governor Bukola Saraki of Kwara State and former National Security Adviser, NSA, Alhaji Aliyu Mohammed Gusau are among the front-runners in the on-going race for the nation’s topmost seat in Aso Rock, Abuja. They are both aspiring on the plank of the ruling Peoples Democratic Party, PDP.\nThey are both Northerners. They are also among the quartet of Northern presidential hopefuls, who want to join forces and a pick a consensus northern presidential flagbearer, to contest the PDP ticket with President Goodluck Jonathan.\nThese seem to be where the similarities end. Saraki and Gusau are indeed different. They are not from the same geo-political zone. Saraki hails from North-Central while Gusau is from North-West. Separately, they are prosecuting their electoral war games in unique manners. They don’t also belong to the same age group and do not share the same governance and administrative experience.\nSaturday Vanguard took a peep into how the duo have been running their campaigns in the last two weeks, their strength, their weaknesses and their chances and what was observed was quite revealing.\nCan Saraki get it done?\nSince he joined the presidential race on September 20, Saraki has electrified the political atmosphere with his rapid campaigns. He has set his foot soldiers loose in the tight race to woo PDP delegates across the country. He has taken about 50 pages of colour adverts in national newspapers to sell himself. He is not averse to using all legal means and avenues to convince the electorate.\nLike President Jonathan, who announced his intention to run on Facebook, Saraki is also exploiting the unlimited opportunities offered by e-campaigns. His campaign is on Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, Flickr and YouTube.\nWith “Let’s Get It Done,” as campaign slogan, the two-time Kwara State Governor, wants the 2011 presidential polls to be hinged on track record, economy, fresh thinking, generational change and need for vision, ideas and a new direction.\nWithout these, he fears that Nigeria might not realise her potentials. At 50 years after independence, he said: “Our great nation has not fulfilled its potentials and our realities are far from our ideals. It is time for a new generation to build a modern Nigeria.”\nThe aspirant said he was disturbed that five decades after independence, “we have failed to realise the dreams and aspirations of our founding fathers. We are the sixth largest oil producer in the world, yet we import fuel and have no electricity. We have some of the most intelligent and resourceful people on earth, yet we cannot make Nigeria work for you.”\nAccording to him, Nigerians are not expecting too much from their leaders. “If truth be told, you are not asking for much from your government. You just want the custodians of our common wealth to give you good roads, good hospitals, good schools and a constant supply of electricity.\nYou want potable water, food to eat and a roof over your head. You want sensible policies that create opportunities; to profit from your labour, to use your God-given abilities to improve your lot and to take care of your aged and loved ones.\nYou want to give back to your community and you want a political system that encourages people to contribute to the development of our fatherland.\nYou want to be safe, to take a stroll in the night without fear. These are the yearnings in our hearts.”\n“We can only attain these with effective, capable, caring, courageous and visionary leadership. We require fresh ideas and new thinking. This is the kind of leadership I have offered as Governor of Kwara State,” he declared.\nIf given the mandate, Saraki promised among others to:\n*Build bridges of understanding across the nation\n*Get the economy moving\n*Educate our children\n* Provide security, housing and boost agricultural production\n* Enforce laws of the land and check crimes\n* Create jobs\n* Revamp healthcare\n* Empower women and the youths\nHis strength, chances Saraki believes he can deliver on these promises and wants the electorate to judge him based on his track record as Kwara State governor. He claims that in seven years he had transformed Kwara State and given Kwarans reasons to be proud of their state.\n“Under my leadership, Kwara State became a reference point for new ideas, determination, dynamism and possibilities. An agro-allied economy was developed, jobs were created and power generation became a reality.\nI can do the same for Nigeria. Nigeria is a bigger undertaking, but the challenge of leadership is the same.”\nSired by Second Republic Senate Leader and acclaimed father of Kwara politics, Dr. Olusola Saraki, the first-time presidential aspirant has, in his father, a political pedigree to lean on. It is therefore not a surprise that he broke the jinx of being re-elected as governor in Kwara State. Olusola Saraki is the leader of Northern Union, NU and is expected to deploy his political network in the aid of his biological and political son.\nShortly after his re-election in 2007, Saraki became the chairman of the Governors’ Forum, a gathering of the 36 states helmsmen of the country. He wielded much influence among the governors and was a major power broker under the administration of the late President Umaru Musa Yar’Adua.\nHe was instrumental to the appointment of a host of ministers, presidential aides and heads of agencies under Yar’Adua.\nSaraki was born on December 19, 1962. So, his supporters said he has age on his side as he will be 48 years in two months time. According to them, leaders of most leading countries of the world are within Saraki’s age bracket and Nigeria could ill-afford not to be blown by the generational wind of change.\nThey include Barrack Obama, USA, 48; David Cameron, UK, 43; Dimitri Medvedev, Russia, 45; Stephen Harper, Canada, 51; Julia Gillard, Australia, 49; Nicolas Sarkozy, France, 55; Luis Zapatero, Spain, 49; and Jose Socrates, Portugal, 53.\nBefore venturing into politics, Saraki was educated in both Nigeria and the UK and qualified and practiced as a Doctor in London before returning to Nigeria in 1989. He later became Director of the Societe Generale Bank. He joined the public sector as special adviser to President Olusegun Obasanjo on Budget in 2000. He served on the Economic Policy Co-ordination Committee and later as the Chairman of the Presidential Committee on Non-Oil Revenue Generation.\nTo realise his presidential ambition, Saraki is expected to maximally utilise his strengths and mobilise support across the country.\nHe is unarguably among the newest presidential aspirants in Nigeria’s political firmament. Although he is from the North, pundits say his being Yoruba might count against him, less than four years after another Yoruba man, Obasanjo, quit power.\nHe is also from North-Central geo-political zone, which has held power longer than any other zone in the country. Since independence, the zone, through military dictators, had ruled Nigeria for 18 years.\nHe is also expected to build political structures across the 36 states and this is not yet on ground.\nCurrently, he is considered to have political anchor in Kwara, Kebbi and Gombe states.\nOlusola Saraki’s decision to endorse his daughter Senator Gbemi Saraki, to succeed Bukola Saraki has been criticized and considered as being insensitive to the notion of equity and balance in the sharing of political offices at a time the presidential aspirant is mouthing ‘zoning’ at the federal level.\nHis campaign promises notwithstanding, some critics said Saraki is in the race primarily to ensure that power remains in the North. And that this accounts for his working accord with Gen. Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar and Gusua to produce a consensus northern candidate.\nHe also has to handle the perception that he was bent on going all the way if the consensus option did not favour him. Sources said he expects the older politicians to give him the nod to proceed.\nBesides, his campaign team is considered unrepresentative with only Dr. Udenta O. Udenta, former secretary of the Alliance for Democracy, AD as the only Igbo in the top echelon. He is expected to get the backing of political heavyweights across all zones to sail through and this is not easy to come by.\nGusau’s long thirst for presidency\nAmong the crowd of presidential aspirants, Gusau has stayed longest in the corridors of power. Publicly he has been nursing the ambition of occupying the most powerful seat since 2006. And privately, as long as anyone can imagine. The retired general has been deeply involved in the nation’s public life for nearly 30 years starting from the military regime of Maj. Gen Muhammadu Buhari in January 1, 1984.\nHe was at various times head of Defence Intelligence Agency, National Intelligence Agency, Chief of Army Staff, and under the Chief Olusegun Obasanjo presidency, the security adviser. He was also a key player in the governments of Generals Muhammadu Buhari, Ibrahim Babangida, Sani Abacha and Obasanjo.\nGusau contested for the PDP’s ticket in December 2006, but he was beaten to the second position by the late Yar’Adua, who was largely backed by the party big guns, including former President Obasanjo.\nThereafter, Gusau went into retirement hoping to make another bid for the Presidency. He was still knocking together his political team when he was called upon by President Jonathan, then acting President, to serve as the NSA, at a time the nation’s ship of state faced some turbulence and instability as President Yar’Adua’s illness turned the latter into a lame duck.\nThe job, the fifth time he would be so appointed, temporarily demobilized his political footwork, but not his interest, his aides had said.\nSpeaking through the Director General of his campaign organisation, Sen. Ben Obi, the former NSA said if elected into office in 2011, he would focus on such critical areas as power, energy, security, justice and evenly distributed prosperity.\nHe said that Gusau’s entrance into the race does not negate the desire of the Northern elders to produce a consensus candidate for the North. He wants the election to be anchored on issues, experience and ability to deliver.\nGusau’s aides told Vanguard that one factor that would favour him, in the pursuit of the Presidency, is his network of powerful friends, outside Nigeria and all over the country, with a lot of them within the ruling PDP.\nAliyu Gusau is said to have wielded enormous influence across the country and beyond, and has been deeply involved in the nation’s public life for about 26 years.\nHe is considered as the power-behind-the-throne in most of the administrations since President Ibrahim Babangida took power in ‘a palace coup’ in August of 1985. But for Babangida’s coup, accounts had it that Buhari would have sacked Gusau from the army because of his influence on the rank and file of the military.\nGusau spearheaded the re-organisation of the security and intelligence apparatuses of the Nigeria Security Organisation , NSO during the Buhari regime. The intelligence and security operations of the nation was broken up into three organizations: State Security Services (SSS), National Intelligence Agency (NIA) and the Directorate of Military Intelligence (DMI).\nThe Gen Abdulsalami Abubakar regime also enlisted Gusau’s services for the recovery of huge sums looted by the Abacha regime from foreign banks.\nAccording to reports, Gusau was one of those who were consulted by the Nigerian military establishment and international intelligence and diplomatic agencies on the way to picking the president in 1999. His favourable reports were said to have aided Obasanjo’s emergence.\nA quiet and smooth operator, he is said to have been building his network for sometime now.\nBorn in 1943 in Gusau, Zamfara State, Aliyu’s career in the army dated back to 1967, when he was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant on March 18. He attained the peak of his career when he was made the NSA during the Babangida regime and when IBB’s regime ended; Gusau became the Chief of Army Staff to the infamous Ernest Shonekan-led Interim National Government.\nHis supporters said he was one person who could not be over looked in the politics of Nigeria, as his intelligence and military connections allegedly caused the rise or fall of over five civilian and military regimes.\nHis expertise, his local and international reach which is believed to be second to none and his credibility among the northern circles may work to his advantage.\nSo far, his campaigns have been devoid of media glitz. He is considered strong in only three states – Jigawa, Sokoto and Zamfara. In spite of his wide consultations, he appears not have got the support of principal stakeholders across the country, especially in the South.\nAt 68 years, the clamour of generational change is against his aspiration. He also has a tough nut to crack to emerge as the Northern consensus aspirant.\nBesides, Gusau is from the North-West zone that had held power for about 14 years through military and civilian regimes.\nCritics said his major credential – security advisory experience, had not rubbed off positively on the country. According to them, if his advice had jelled, the country would not be caught in the web of kidnapping (Sooth-East), militancy (Niger-Delta), religious and ethnic violence (North) and armed robbery and assassination, etc, all over the country.\nHis hope seems to hang on the outcome of the consensus arrangement. And if it did not in his favour, he publicly declared last week that he would throw in the towel\nIt was alleged yesterday that he was ready to drop his ambition to back one of the three northern aspirants in the consensus option.\nContacted, his campaign director, Senator Obi, said it was not true. “I don’t know about that. At least I should know.”\nObi said the 17 wise men, were still working on the consensus candidate and would come out with their choice very soon.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"http://www.vanguardngr.com/2010/10/2011-how-far-can-saraki-gusau-go/","2":"3110","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9998378754"},{"0":"Osun State Governor Gboyega Oyetola and candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the just concluded governorship election in the state is prepared to seek legal means to upturn the results in his favour.\nRecall candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, Senator Ademola Adeleke was declared winner of the Osun governorship held on Saturday, July 16, 2022.\nAdeleke polled PDP 403,371 to defeat Oyetola and the APC with 375,027 votes, while Lasun Yusuf of Labour Party, LP polled 2,729\nSpeaking on Oyetola’s preparation for legal action against Adeleke’s victory, Kunle Adegoke, a senior advocate who is a member of Oyetola’s legal team revealed to Vanguard that 50 lawyers have indicated interest to join the case.\nWhen asked about the legal grounds with which Oyetola will be challenging Adeleke, Adegoke stated that they are still studying the election results and building their evidence.\n“We are still studying the election results, working on the legal grounds, and building evidence to challenge Adeleke’s declaration as governor-elect; as we speak, about 50 lawyers have indicated interest to join us.” He said.\nMeanwhile, a Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) chieftain, Diran Odeyemi, had earlier told Vanguard that any aggrieved politician who plans to take legal action against the victory of the Osun State governor-elect, Adeleke, is giving money to lawyers for an academic exercise.\n“An average Nigerian politician doesn’t accept defeat until they get to the Supreme Court.\n“So if anybody is still arguing or going to court over primary election that has been conducted, and as a matter of fact it’s now at the Appeal Court as you put it, with the overwhelming support of the people of Osun State, you will realise or agree with me that the person is just giving his money to legal people to just for academic exercise.\n“We are not bothered.

What I did was to listen to the security challenges from the Commissioner of Police and if he or she successfully defended it, I took it to the council for approval.\n“Security vote in my own opinion is a big way of stealing money and that was why I didn’t do it as a governor.\n“If I have the opportunity again, there will be nothing like the security vote in the presidency.\n“We have seen cases where a lot of funds were been stolen under the guise of security votes and in my opinion, I think that should be stopped.”\nHe pledged to boost the morale of the security agencies by increasing their personnel and giving them needed training and exposure to make them confront the myriad of security challenges bedevilling the country.\nHe also promised to reduce the lack of coordination among the security personnel.\n“We are very much aware of the issue of synergy and coordination within our security sector.

Due process was followed to proscribe it. The job of the military was to diagnose security issues and warned the public of consequences and that is part of our media operations.\n“We did our media operations very well, otherwise that weekend would have been the longest weekend in this country and we are also very careful choosing our words and we know the law very well, “he added.\nHe also denied that the military troops on Operation Python Dance raided Kanu’s home.\nHear him:” Nobody raided Kanu’s home and I stand to be justified, not from the information I got.

Those who identify as LGBTQ+ can be seen as ‘different’ by some, facing discrimination, bullying and a lack of understanding which can lead to mental health concerns.\nWhile things in society are slowly moving forward in terms of acceptance, we still have a long way to go. Incredibly, the World Health Organisation only removed ‘homosexuality’ as a formal psychiatric diagnosis in 1992.\nThe fact is, being LGBTQ+ does not lead to mental health problems - dealing with other people’s adverse reactions does. Because of this, those who don’t identify as heterosexual are more likely to experience mental health problems. Here we’ll explore sexuality and mental health in more detail, where to find support and coming out concerns.\nSex and relationship therapist Beck Harrison explains how an LGBTQ+ therapist can help with a range of issues, and what to look for when searching for an LGBTQ+ therapist.\nSexuality and mental health\nLGBTQ+ people can be at a greater risk of developing a mental health condition than those in the wider population. According to the Mental Health Foundation, a survey carried out by Stonewall found that half of LGBTQ+ people experience depression and three in five experience anxiety.\nThe reasons for this are complex and not entirely understood, however, most mental health problems experienced can be linked to discrimination, bullying, homophobia, biphobia or transphobia.\nIf you identify as LGBTQ+ and you’re struggling with your mental health, know that you’re not alone. You may be particularly prone to:\n- Depression - when you experience a low mood for a long period of time.\n- Anxiety - when you feel especially anxious or worried for long periods of time or at a high intensity.\n- Self-harm - when you hurt yourself on purpose to cope with difficult emotions.\n- Suicidal thoughts - when you feel very low and as if there is no way out.\nYou may experience rejection from those around you, including friends, family and work colleagues. Other factors may also complicate things, for example where you live, your ethnicity and religious background. Understandably, this can all have a big impact on your sense of self-worth and your confidence. You may feel the need to hide this part of yourself from others, and this can be damaging in itself.\nSome people may find they turn to alcohol and drugs to help them cope with difficult emotions. If you’re worried about the way you’re using alcohol or drugs, your doctor, a counsellor or an addiction helpline can offer support.\nThere are hidden covert messages in the media about what it means to be 'normal' which in some way reinforces the message that being different is not acceptable. The notion of 'fitting in' not just in the wider community but within LGBT communities can and does come with its own pressures.\n- Read more on LGBT mental health.\nSpeaking to a counsellor can help with some of the difficulties you’re facing, such as:\n- finding it hard to accept your sexuality\n- coping with other people’s reactions\n- low self-esteem and low self-confidence\n- fear of violence or abuse in public places\n- effects of bullying and discrimination\n- feeling as if your body does not reflect your true gender (gender dysphoria)\nIf you develop a mental health condition, talking therapies can help you find new ways of coping and either overcome or manage your condition. What’s important is for you to find a counsellor who you trust and feel able to talk to openly about your experiences. For this reason, it can be helpful to check your counsellor has experience working with LGBTQ+ people and/or has had appropriate training.\nIf at any point you feel uncomfortable with your counsellor, remember you have every right to stop your sessions and find a more suitable counsellor for you.\nI find that people come to me either because they want to discuss their sexuality or gender identity, or because they want that to be understood as something that is a part of them, but it’s not what they’re seeking therapy for. A cisgender, heterosexual therapist will often be able to offer that, but not always.\n- Jennifer Tomkinson, MBACP (Accred), PGDip, shares tips for finding a therapist if you identify as LGBTQ+\nOther forms of support\nAside from talking therapy and counselling, many LGBTQ+ people find it helpful to connect with others in the community. You may want to join a support group online or connect with campaigners. There are a number of organisations and charities that support and campaign for LGBTQ+ people, Mind has an excellent list of resources.\nDiscrimination - what’s the law?\nAttitudes in the UK towards the LGBTQ+ community do slowly seem to be improving, however, there are still some people who discriminate against others based on their gender and/or sexuality. There is a law against this at work and in wider society - The Equality Act 2010.\nThis protects gay, lesbian, bisexual and trans people and anyone who experiences discrimination because they associate with LGBTQ+ people. You can find out more about what the Equality Act 2010 covers and includes on the gov.uk website.\nThe term ‘coming out’ is often used to describe when you tell people about your sexual orientation and/or your gender identity. For some, it can take a long time to feel comfortable to do this. It’s important to know that you don’t need to come out at a certain time, you simply need to do what feels good and right for you.\nHaving these conversations can be difficult. You may experience unpleasant reactions and even rejection in some cases. This can make coming out an emotionally trying time. And sadly, for many, coming out isn’t a one-time thing. Every time you meet someone new or start a new job, for example, you may need to consider when or how much of your identity as an LGBTQ+ person you want to share.\nDespite what may sound like negative repercussions of coming out, this doesn’t happen to everyone. Many people are supported and understood by those they’re coming out to.\nHiding who you are, however, can be an incredibly difficult thing to do and can be damaging to your mental health and well-being.\nI had a realisation that I was gay and that it wasn’t a good thing to be. I began a nine-year battle with hiding the deepest part of who I was. This was one of the heaviest masks I wore.\n- Read Chris Dudley's experience of OCD and depression.\nEveryone will ‘come out’ in different ways. For many, it’s a series of conversations that take place between the LGBTQ+ person and the people in their life they want to tell. It’s important for you to come out in a way that feels right for you and your circumstances.\nTelling someone you trust and believe will be supportive first can be a good idea. They can then provide you with some support as you tell others in your life. Picking a time when you can talk through any concerns and worries is also recommended.\nTry to keep in mind that although this is likely something you have known about yourself for a long time, for others, it may be a surprise. Initial reactions may be laced with shock, and they may change over time.\nCreating a support network, whether that includes friends, family members, online communities or professional support (or all of these!) can be incredibly helpful when taking this step.\nAbove all, please remember you are not alone. With greater understanding, kindness and representation hopefully making its way through society - we can only push for progress.\n- London Lesbian and Gay Switchboard: 020 7837 7324\n- Online safety guide for LGBTQ+ community\nTrust our content\nWe are a PIF TICK 'trusted information creator'.

Real GDP growth is projected to improve significantly to 2.19 per cent in 2017, reaching 7 per cent at the end of the plan period.”\nIn its latest report, the World Bank stated: “In Nigeria, the economy is projected to grow 2.1 percent in 2018 and 1.9 percent in 2019 (up from 0.8 percent in 2017), reflecting improved oil prices, revenue, and production and recently introduced foreign exchange measures that contribute to better foreign exchange availability.”\nThe report also indicated that Nigeria would be under-performing the sub-Sahara Africa group of economies which the World Bank projected would rise to 3.4 percent in 2018, up from 2.8 percent actual recorded in 2017, and improve slightly thereafter through the medium term to about 4.0 percent.\nThough the report did not state reasons for the Nigeria down-grade, it is likely tied to its earlier observations in previous reports that noted the adverse effects of political developments on the economies of sub-Sahara Africa.\nIt also corresponds to the position of the ERGP document which stated: “The slight dip in growth in 2019 is projected to result from the general election in that year with a quick recovery the following year.”\nThe current World Bank report has, however, aligned with inflationary trend in Nigeria while indicating that a possible policy adjustment by the Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN, sometime down this year would sustain the inflation rate at double digit through 2018.\nInflation rate in Nigeria measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI) has been on steady downward trend in the past 15 consecutive months dropping to 13.34 per cent in March year-on-year, from 14.33 percent in February according to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) report for March 2018.\nThe latest World Bank report stated: “Inflation in sub-Sahara Africa is projected to moderate slightly in 2018 and 2019 but is expected to remain in double digits in key large economies, reflecting the pass-through effects of currency depreciation and their impact on inflation expectations (Angola), supply factors, and assumed monetary policy accommodation to support fiscal policy (Nigeria).”\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"https://www.vanguardngr.com/2018/04/world-bank-reviews-nigerias-economic-growth-downwards/","2":"795","3":"Politics","4":"2","5":"en","6":"0.9999904633"},{"0":"*456 foreigners in 41 companies in the sector doing jobs Nigerians can do\n*4 such companies account for 186 expatriates\n*Fruit juice firm holds expatriates in excess of 65; flour miller 43; another fruit juice firm 45 excess\n*Persistent influx of expatriates is in flagrant disregard to Presidential Executive Order 5 — Workers’ union\nBy Victor Ahiuma-Young\nIndustrial unrest is looming in the Food and Beverages sector of the nation’s economy over alleged expatriate quota abuse by multi-nationals and other major companies in the industry.\nAlready, organised labour has petitioned the Federal Government through the Ministry of Labour and Employment, accusing a major multi-national in the sector of flagrant abuse of expatriate quota.\nVanguard’s investigations revealed that there are no fewer than 456 foreigners in 41 companies in the sector doing jobs Nigerians can conveniently do, with four of such companies accounting for 186 expatriates.\nTwo of such companies, according to the labour leaders, are a fruit juice processing company based in Lagos and a flour milling giant. The fruit juice firm is said to be holding expatriates in excess of 65 while the flour miller holds 43.\nAnother beverage (fruit juice) company in a neighbouring state is said to be holding 45 excess expatriates.\nAccording to labour sources, two major bottling companies have 24 excess expatriates, while another based in Ogun State has 11 foreigners in the company without compliance with Nigeria’s expatriate quota rules.\nIn the beverages sub-sector, four Lagos-based companies have 65, 16, five and four foreigners outside their expatriate quota, while six companies based in Ogun State, have 45, 13, six, six, five, three and three excess expatriates respectively.\nAlso, two companies in the list (manufacturing biscuits) in Lagos, have 15 and nine foreigners working for them outside their expatriate quota while a company based in Ibadan, Oyo State has no fewer than 30 of such workers.\nSimilarly, in the confectionery industry, the labour report indicated that two Ibadan, Oyo State-based companies have 14 and five excess expatriates in their establishments.\nThe labour source also said a noodles manufacturing company in Ogun State, has no fewer than 21 excess expatriates working in the firm.\nFour other companies in the sector have two foreigners each, three in Ibadan, Oyo State, have two expatriates each, while three others also in Ibadan, have one each above their quotas.\n‘We need expatriates, but…’\nLamenting the situation, a labour leader who spoke to Vanguard on condition of anonymity, said, “With the level of our development, we cannot say we do not need expatriates. We need them in areas where we do not have local expertise. But our grouse is the abuse.\n“We have situations where just one expatriate is required but the company comes along with 20 or more who, in every sense of it, are not experts, but mere tools to fight unemployment in their countries, siphon money out of our country and so on.\n“In other words, they are coming to take up the few available jobs thousands of Nigerians are struggling for. They have no expertise to impact on or give to Nigerians. In fact, in most cases, it is Nigerians that end up training them.\n“Yet they are paid in dollars with each of them receiving Naira equivalent that can employ 10 or more Nigerians.\n“The rule guiding expatriate is clear; that is, people with the technical competence not available in Nigeria so that they can come in and train Nigerians for about two or three years.\n‘‘After this period, such expatriate will return to his or her country. But what we have today is a situation where they come, spend three years, and at the expiration of their permits, the permits are renewed through whatever means.\nREAD ALSO: Non-alcoholic excise tax: Food and beverages sector to loss N1.9trillion in 3 years – MAN\n“Before you realise it, they become permanent expatriates. In some cases, instead of the expatriate going back, with the connivance of dubious officials and agencies, the expatriate will move from one organisation to another and eventually, before you know it, he or she is given permanent residence permit.\n“This is unacceptable to us. We need expatriates, but they must follow due process and comply with rules of engagement.\n‘‘Anywhere the Indians, the Lebanese, and generally, the Asians operate, they cause trouble. They are the people causing problem in the industry. They are the ones giving us the most problems in this area.\n“We go to our National Joint Industrial Negotiating Council, we do not have large percentage of representation because of these Asians.\n“We have told the employers body to call their members to order, especially the Indians. If you go into these companies controlled by Indians you will see what they are using Nigerians to do. It is nothing short of modern slavery.”\nOrganised Labour in the sector, under the aegis of the National Union of Foods, Beverages and Tobacco Employees, NUFBTE, and its Food, Beverage and Tobacco Senior Staff Association, FOBTOB, counterpart, are not taking the perceived abuse lightly.\nPresident of FOBTOB, Jimoh Oyibo, while decrying the level of expatriate quota abuse in the sector, said:\n“We are seriously disturbed by the increase in the number that has flooded the companies in our industry. This is disheartening and unacceptable to us. This attitude alone has led to continuous taking over of jobs that are exclusive rights of indigenous workers.\n“Although, we have tackled the menace headlong in the past and I am using this medium to state that we will continue the struggle to save our jobs.”\nSpeaking to Vanguard, the Acting General Secretary of NUFBTE, Mike Olarewaju, said, “Our union views this practice of abusing expatriate quota as a deliberate sabotage to Nigerian economy as well as a subtle channel for capital flight.\n“In the same vein, it is a threat to job dignity and employment opportunities of Nigerians. ‘‘Consequently, our union outrightly condemns this practice.\n“The so-called expatriates are being engaged in various departments including, Production, Supply Chain, Sales, Engineering, Quality Assurance and Stores among others,\n‘‘Our Union has made several reports and protests to relevant ministries and other statutory bodies.”\nThe union, Vanguard gathered, has decided to tackle the abuse on company-to-company basis, and is presently battling a soft drink company, over alleged “persistent influx of expatriate and flagrant disregard to Presidential Executive Order 5”.\nIn a petition addressed to the Minister of Labour and Employment, Senator Chris Ngige, NUFBTE through its Acting General Secretary, Mike Olarewaju, among others, stated: “Further to our letters on the above subject particularly reference to our letters dated 10th September,2017, 3rd October, 2017 and 17th January, 2020 respectively.\n“It is extremely sad and depressing to observe that the management of this company (name witheld) has continuously flouted with impunity the tenets of our previous mutual understanding by pervading deliberate acts of disobedience to the intents and contents of the letters under reference which undoubtedly amounts to unconscionable violation of the presidential executive order “5” with impunity.\n“Despite the unambiguous positions of our union as duly enunciated in our previous letters and meetings where your management promised to checkmate the trend, however, it is evidently clear that your management has continued unabatedly to engage in glaring acts of degradation and subjugation of Nigerians working in the company.\n“Consequently, our union has resolved to frontally checkmate this undesirable practice of unfair labour practice of perpetuating and relegating Nigerians to second class citizens in Nigeria by depriving them from occupying some management positions while at the same time your management provocatively reserves the positions exclusively for non- Nigerians.\n“Without mincing words, this oppressive practice is despicable, condemnable, provocative and outrightly unacceptable.”\nNUFBTE added that it expects the management of the soft drinks company to act wisely to save the emerging situation from altering the existing industrial harmony.”\nMinistry steps in\nVanguard found that but for the intervention by the appropriate ministry, which has already summoned the management of the soft drinks company and asked it to respond to the petition among others, NUFBTE would have started an industrial action.\nAccording to a labour source, the Ministry has directed the company to provide detailed list of foreigners or expatriates working in the company and their educational qualifications.\nEfforts to speak with the management of the company on the development were unsuccessful.\nA senior management personnel who volunteered information on condition of anonymity, acknowledged that the issue is before the Ministry of Labour and Employment and the company will only respond to the ministry’s query for now.\nIn the same vein, all attempts to speak with the leaders of the Association of Food, Beverage and Tobacco Employers, AFBTE, the umbrella body for employers in the sector, hit a brick wall.\nAn official of the association, however, told Vanguard that the “issue of expatriates are handled by the individual companies. The employers’ body has no role to play.”\nEqually, efforts to speak with the officials of the Ministry of Interior were rebuffed.\nNeither questions sent to one of the aides of the Minister after an initial telephone contact on October 28, has been responded to nor several calls since then till the press time.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"https://www.vanguardngr.com/2021/12/tension-in-foods-drinks-sector-over-expatriate-quota-abuse/","2":"2117","3":"Career","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999923706"},{"0":"By James Ogunnaike, Abeokuta\nFormer President, Chief Olusegun Obasanjo on Monday led current and old students of Baptist Boys High School (BBHS), Abeokuta on an 18km walk round Abeokuta, as part of activities to mark the centenary celebrations of the school.\nObasanjo who was joined by the leadership of the old boys association, led by the National President, Prof. Kayode Oyesiku and large numbers of the current students entertained residents, motorists and passers-by on the walk.\nA statement by his Special Assistant on Media, Kehinde Akinyemi stated that hundreds of residents and enthusiasts echoed and praised Obasanjo’s names for his prowess, energy and endurance to embark on the walk despite his age.\nAmong those who played host to Obasanjo and his team, were the Olubara of Ibara, Oba Jacob Omolade, former Finance Minister, Onolapo Soleye and the Alake of Egbaland, Oba Adedotun Gbadebo.

I hear things all the time was my riposte. It will be an unfortunate disservice to over three decades in the journalism profession if I don’t hear things.\nOh, this is about Dr. Isa Pantami, former Minister of Communications and Digital Economy. He doesn’t want to leave the Ministry or its parastatals. He is plotting a return.\nHey! You can’t quarrel with that. Dr Pantami can take any action that excites his body. After all, he is a politician. And Nigerian politicians are known to be very restless, like locusts, which is why they move from one party to another once they sense any impending moment of dullness or a dip in the expected returns on political investment. Pantami is obviously too exciteable to accommodate any dullness.\nWhether out of excitement, enthusiasm or even overzealousness, Pantami swept into the ministry with gusto and began to initiate series of actions that would reverberate in the entire telecommunications industry. Actions in the industry, whether by the Ministry or the regulator, are weighed on the strength of the Communications Act 2003, which can unquestionably be described as the Bible of telecommunications.\nUnder his watch the Nigerian Communications Communications Commission, NCC, conducted two 5G auctions in the 3.5GHz band and raked in over $800m. That was a good harvest, something extraordinary that the Buhari government would always gloat over.\nIn spite of the preceding observation, the minister does not have the good luck to enjoy the kind of cover which the NBC Act Cap N11 2004, gives the counterpart in Section 6, to the effect, that the minister can give any general direction that can override any regulatory decision of the National Broadcasting Commission, NBC. Instead the Communications Act 2003 shields the Nigerian Communications Commission from every external encumbrance and restricts the minister and his ministry to the areas of policy.\nThis could be the reason some of the actions of the minister at the Communications and Digital Economy ministry didn’t seem to ingratiate him to the industry irrespective of his claims of achievements. He came in a blaze and left in a welter of furore. On being appointed minister in August 2019, Pantami immediately moved into the regulator’s property at Mbora, Abuja. This was too close for comfort. The regulator’s peace had been traduced and uncertainty would soon envelope the regulator that used to be the pride of the nation and even the continent.\nThe minister started to exert undue influence on the regulator by way of regulatory capture. All of a sudden, there was a rash and indiscriminate employment at the NCC. Could the minister have gotten too close to know that there was staffing need at the NCC and decided to help solve the problem? Employment used to be planned at the NCC like procurement, methodical and diligent, and only available for some of the best in the land.\nThis time there was a deluge of employment without respect for the principles of the Federal Character Commission. Most of the people recruited were spirited into zonal offices where their employment would never really be accounted for. The nominal roll spiralled from less than 800 in 2019 to over 1600 in 2023. Some people call what happened at the NCC a big employment scam. But I wouldn’t be that harsh. The regulator came under so much pressure that it forgot its indenpence enshrined in the Act or lost the scent of its corporate culture.\nFor instance, the minister claimed to have been given approval by former President Muhammadu Buhari to employ three directors. Profs. Salahu Balarabe Junaid and Aminu Ahmad were employed as NCC directors. Perhaps they were part of his technical team but it broke the norm. Why were they not employed as Ministry staff? In the past, NCC staff were seconded to the ministers for all necessary technical support, people with competences in various fields of communications.\nFurthermore, as a proof of the obtuse recruitment at the Commission in the past few years, a promotion exercise carried out by the regulator early this year, had all 15 Senior Officers (GL9) that were promoted come from a section of the country. Insiders even nailed it down to a couple of states in that part of the country. Some workers at the Commission said that was a very strange development and traced it to external pressure.\nPantami’s tenure at the ministry destroyed peace and long existing camaraderie at the NCC and sowed discord, distrust and suspicion among the staff. Some workers were given positions of advantage and all of sudden they began to see themselves as products of sections of the country instead of the harmony that used to be among them. They were no longer part of the knitted whole.\nIn a particular instance, the minister wrote to the President early in the year and prayed that a particular position at the Universal Service Provision Fund, USPF, be indemnified in the name of one person, until this person retires. I can testify that the person in the position is a good man, a very good, affable guy. I don’t think that such indemnity is what he yearns for. No. Not at all. But I also want to say that good souls can buckle under sustained pressure.\nAlthough the minister is the USP Board chairman with the executive vice chairman of the NCC as vice, he does not have the support of the Communications Act 2003, from Sections 112 to 120 to canvass such request or validate such appointment.\nTo support his prayer, the minister made reference to a certain section of the Act in his memo to the President late December. Beyond the Act, this is what Section 23 of the Universal Access and Universal Service Regulation 2007, says: “The Commission shall appoint an individual person to serve as the head of the USP Secretariat ( the USP Secretary ) who shall be responsible for the day to day operations of the secretariat. The USP Secretary shall be an employee of the Commission that has been seconded from the Commission’s staff to serve as the USP Secretary on or a full-time basis.”\nThe Commission has its internal employment policy which allows it to move workers around internally to work in different positions. The minister has only meddled in, and muddled up such internal policy.\nHere is what seems to be Pantami’s final act. In a letter dated May 8, the Commission conveyed the approval of waiver request made to the President through the minister by Emerging Markets Telecommunications Limited, EMTS. At a time the country is neck-deep in debt and lacks cash to run even daily operations, the President gave a 50 per cent waiver on the huge debt being owed by EMTS on spectrum fees. The waiver is as follows: N43,608,048,767.50 and for the 2100MHZ band, the sum of N29,329,977, 600. Over the next ten years the balance would be paid in instalments as follows N4,360,804,876.75 for the 900/1800MHz and N2,932,997,760.00 for the 2100MHz band.\nOn Monday night, an industry source told this writer: “We shall respond. We know who is doing this. It is not the NCC but the minister.”\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"https://www.vanguardngr.com/2018/09/battle-to-control-ssouth-oshiomhole-versus-amaechi/Before","2":"1558","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999961853"},{"0":"Governor of Edo State, Mr Godwin Obaseki\nGovernor Godwin Obaseki has expressed his administration’s desire to make Edo State the most prosperous economy in the South-South within the next three years.\nBesides, Obaseki expressed confidence that in another seven to ten years, he will position the State as the number one economy in the country, a statement by the Chief Press Secretary, Mr. John Mayaki said.\nWhile declaring open a 3-day strategic policy dialogue workshop with the theme: Setting Agenda for the new Administration with Permanent Secretaries in the state civil service as participants as well as political leaders and critical stakeholders in the state, Obaseki said, “15 to 20 years, we want to be the number one investment destination in the continent,’’ adding that to achieve this vision for the state, “first class institutions capable of nurturing transformation policies must be built”.\n“We must deliver on infrastructure that is better than what is available in the Federal Capital Territory.

Dave Umahi, during the inspection tour of some key road projects of the Federal Government with Dr. Peter Mbah in Enugu, Sunday evening.\nBriefing newsmen at the end of the inspection, Umahi said, “The Enugu-Onitsha, Enugu-Port Harcourt and Enugu to Abakaliki roads are three very key projects that are dear to the people of South East. And the president has given adequate attention and the governor of Enugu State has also complemented the efforts of the president in the development of these sections.\n“We have inspected the flyover at Emene NNPC Depot attracted from Mr. President by the governor. That job is ongoing and I can say that it is about 40 per cent done.\n“I am happy that we are doing that flyover because the governor, on his own, undertook to do the daulisation of the Enugu-Abakaliki road and work is ongoing. So, it is a challenge to the FG, hence you see the people doing the flyover component of that daulisation, day and night.”\nThe Minister frowned at the prolonged blockade of parts of the Enugu-Onitsha expressway from Abakpa Junction, Enugu by the contractor, thus causing road users untold hardship.\n“We saw that in Abakpa sections, over 3km is being blocked by RCC, which is the sub-contractor of MTN. So, we have agreed and I have called the contractor, that by Tuesday, if they don’t start work, we are going to remove the barricade. The suffering is just too much.\n“We also agreed on the flyover components of Enugu-Onitsha that the governor has already concluded with the subcontractor working for MTN. We got involved for him to go ahead and fund it,” he stated.\nUmahi equally commended Governor Mbah for undertaking the dualisation of the Abakpa Nike-Ugwogo-Opi Nsukka road as well the completion of part of the Ninth Mile-Opi road.\n“I also want to thank the governor very highly, as he is also willing to do that 3km up to Opi junction on the Enugu – Makurdi road. He is willing to put the wearing course and I will allow him to do that if by Tuesday, RCC does not remoblise to site, because people are really suffering everyday,” he said.\nUmahi and Governor Mbah also inspected the ongoing construction of a twin-bridge at New Artisan, at the Enugu end of the Enugu-Port Harcourt expressway where the Minister gave the contractors till October 2024 to complete the project.\n“I have been here more than 10 times since the collapse of the bridge. The governor went to see Mr. President and Mr President directed immediately for this work to be done. This work is being done by CCECC. I must commend them very highly for the quality of work and speed. This is the speed that Enugu Governor desires and he is also very happy with this.\n“I want to thank the governor that the moment we put a temporary bypass as he demanded of the president, he had to rebuild all the destroyed roads and I sympathise with him,” he said.\nHe said that owing to paucity of funds, the FG would allow the Enugu State Government to complete the remaining part of the 61km road starting from Naira Triangle based on FG’s Highway Development Management Initiative, HDMI, which is a PPP arrangement, unless the contractors, DGC Nigeria, were willing to continuously finish the project within the next one year and get paid on milestones basis.\nUmahi commended Governor Mbah for placing governance above party differences, stressing that “after elections, we should stop deceiving the people about party and commit to the campaign promises instead.”\nSpeaking, Governor Mbah commended the FG’s commitment to addressing the challenge of road infrastructure in the region.\n“We know that we are a common stock in the South East. But we also understand the importance of building a common market, and that common market cannot happen if we do not have good roads.\n“So, we cannot thank Mr. President and also the Minister enough for the tireless efforts and commitment they have shown in having our roads all paved,” Mbah said.\nThe Real Person!\nThe Real Person!\nThank you so much my governor, and the honourable minister of work for your good intentions for our dear State and region.

SARS, which stood for Special Anti-Robbery Squad, was supposed to be the elite Nigerian police unit dedicated to fighting crime, but it was really a moneymaking terror squad with no accountability. SARS was random, vicious, vilely extortionist. SARS officers would raid bars or stop buses on the road and arbitrarily arrest young men for such crimes as wearing their hair in dreadlocks, having tattoos, holding a nice phone or a laptop, driving a nice car. Then they would demand large amounts of money as “bail.”\nSARS officers once arrested my cousin at a beer parlor because he arrived driving a Mercedes. They accused him of being an armed robber, ignored the work ID cards he showed them, took him to a station where they threatened to photograph him next to a gun and claim he was a robber, unless he paid them a large sum of money. My cousin is one of the fortunate few who could pay an amount large enough for SARS, and who was released. He is not one of the many tortured, or the many disappeared, like Chijioke Iloanya.\nIn 2012 Mr. Iloanya was 20 when SARS officers arrested him at a child dedication ceremony in Anambra State. He had committed no crime. His family tried to pay to have him released but were asked to bring more money than they had. So they sold their property to raise money and went back to the SARS office but Mr. Iloanya was no longer there. They have not seen him since. Photos of him on social media show a young man, still almost a child, with sensitive eyes and a future waiting for him. There are so many families like the Iloanyas who are caught between pain and hope, because their sons and brothers were arrested by SARS and they fear the worst, knowing the reputation of SARS, but still they dare to hope in the desperate way we humans do for those we love.\nThere have been End SARS protests, since 2016, but October 2020 was different, a tipping point had been reached. The protests signaled the overturning of convention — the protesters insisted on not having a central leadership, it was social rather than traditional media that documented the protests, and, in a country with firm class divisions, the protests cut across class. The protests were peaceful, insistently peaceful, consistently peaceful. They were organized mostly on social media by young Nigerians, born in the 1980s and 1990s, a disaffected generation with the courage to act. Their bravery is inspiring. They speak to hope and to the possibility of what Nigeria could become. Of those involved in the organization, none is more remarkable than a group called Feminist Coalition, set up by Nigerian feminists, who have raised more than $180,000, and have provided legal aid, security and food to protesters.\nBut the Nigerian government tried to disrupt their fund-raising. The Nigerian government has reportedly accused Flutterwave, the company through which the donation link was created, of accepting funds from terrorists, even though it is clear that Feminist Coalition’s members are not terrorists. Their fund-raising link suddenly stopped working. Still, they persisted, and began to raise money through Bitcoin.\nFrom the capital city of Abuja to the small town of Ogbomosho, state agents attacked and beat up protesters. The police killed a few and detained many others, until social media and video evidence forced them to release some of the detained. Still, the protesters persisted.","1":"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/21/opinion/chimamanda-adichie-nigeria-protests.html","2":"743","3":"Politics","4":"2","5":"en","6":"0.9999713898"},{"0":"President Muhammadu Buhari\n…Rights group tasks PSC on equity, fairness in next promotions\nBy Clifford Ndujihe & Anayo Okoli\nOHANAEZE Ndigbo General Assembly Worldwide, OGA, has urged President Muhammadu Buhari to consider appointing an Igbo as the next Inspector-General of Police, IGP.\nThe group was reacting to the president’s appointment of new service chiefs – Lucky Irabor, chief of defence staff; Ibrahim Attahiru, chief of army staff; Awwal Gambo, chief of naval staff, and Isiaka Amao, chief of air staff, on Tuesday\nIn a statement by its President-General, Onuorah Onyeachonam, yesterday, the group said President Buhari excluded Igbo from the appointments and urged him to appoint the most senior Igbo in the force as IGP.\n“There is no Igbo man among the newly appointed service chiefs. Those who claim that the newly appointed Chief of Defence Staff, Maj Gen Leo Irabor is an Igbo man should tell us if Irabor is an Igbo name,” he said.\n“As the Inspector General of Police is due for retirement and fast getting ready to exit the police apex position, we call on the APC- led Federal Government to consider an Igbo man for the position of the Inspector General of Police. If there is no Igbo man or woman qualified for the job of the IGP, promote the Igbo next in line in the Police Force to fit in.”\nRights group writes PSC over promotions in Police, calls for equity, fairness\nThe OGA spoke as the International Society for Civil Liberties and the Rule of Law, Intersociety wrote the Police Service Commission, PSC, asking it to among other issues, deliberate on who succeeds, the current IGP and address what it called “Igbo exclusion and other glaring injustices in police promotions.”\nIn the letter to the commission signed by Emeka Umeagbalasi, Board Chairman, Chinwe Umeche, head, democracy and good governance and Obianuju Joy Igboeli, head, civil liberties and rule of law, the group urged the commission to correct all marginalization in the force, particularly on promotions.\nNoting that Adamu is due for retirement on February 1 and three DIGs, 10 AIGs have reached retirement age and are expected to go with IGP Adamu, the group said there are ”a number of other senior police officers who are part of the Nigeria Police Management Team chaired by the outgoing IGP.\n“As your Commission is likely aware, three DIGs and ten AIGs have reached retirement age and will statutorily retire with IGP Abubakar next Monday, 1st Feb 2021, having joined the Force with the outgoing IGP on 1st Feb 1986.\n“The three retiring DIGs are DIG Baraya, DIG Ogbizi and DIG Oyabade and the 10 retiring Police AIGs are: AIG Karma, AIG Larmode, AIG Mustapha, AIG Inakwu, AIG Mava, AIG Babajide, AIG Babas, AIG Amba, AIG Akpan and AIG Adeoye.\n“We therefore, wish to bring to its attention and remind same of the outcries generated by the Commission’s last promotions on 18th December 2020.\n“The outcries by the public, public interest groups and direct victims of the shoddy promotions range from deliberate total exclusion of Igbo/Southeast officers from the rank of Police AIG and abysmal allocation of CP slots to the region as well as padding the lists of those made CPs, DCPs and ACPs and unjust exclusion from the promotion lists of senior officers due for promotion especially those in the rank of ACP scheduled for promotion to the rank of DCP having successfully undergone the mandatory Promotion Exams and Annual Performance Evaluation Reports (APERs).\n“It is on account of the above that Intersociety is writing your Commission and calling on you to frontally, justly and judiciously address Igbo exclusion and other glaring injustices thrown up in the last promotion exercise which was greeted by widespread outcries and misgivings.\n“The vacuum created by ten retiring AIGs is a golden opportunity for PSC to make amend. Already, fears are growing widely that there may be another round of promotion exercise outside the confines of regional balancing, merit and seniority.\n“We hereby attach for the perusal of your Commission and as a ‘working document’ our expert-opinion paper, released on 29th Dec 2020, findings made in the four-page investigative report which we feel is capable of frontally addressing the said injustices, if judiciously studied and acted upon by your Commission.\n“The investigative findings had frowned at total exclusion of Igbo/Southeast from the list of Police AIGs to the extent that out of the country’s 36 serving AIGs and 17 Police Zonal Commands, headed by same AIGs, no Igbo/Southeast is among them.\n“In the rank of CPs, too, out of the country’s 119, only eight, instead of at least 19, are from Igbo/South-East and of the eight, only six have a minimum of one year-and-a-half to stay in the Force.\n“It is therefore our firm demand that these glaring injustices highlighted above must be frontally and justly addressed. There is need to capture the 17 ACPs left out in the December 18, 2020 promotions in the new promotions.”\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"https://www.vanguardngr.com/2021/01/ohanaeze-general-assembly-asks-buhari-to-consider-igbo-for-igp/","2":"1232","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999599457"},{"0":"The All Progressives Congress Senatorial Candidate for Ogun West Senatorial District in Ogun state, Senator Solomon Adeola has emerged the winner of Ogun West Senatorial District seat in the Presidential and National Assembly Election held yesterday.\nSenator Solomon Adeola who doubles as Chairman of the Senate Committee on Finance, is the senator currently representing Lagos West Senatorial District, he won the Ogun West Senatorial election by a total vote of 112,887 to his closest rival of PDP, Chief Ganiyu Dada Obanibasiri who scored 60,189.

Mr. Buhari, a former army general, who ruled Nigeria for 18 months from 1983 to 1985, had a reputation for being incorruptible and a disciplinarian.\nWhen Mr. Buhari returned to the Aso Rock presidential villa, Nigerians were disgruntled by reports of widespread graft by government appointees, and public services were on the decline. His election was supposed to usher in change, but less than two years later, he has been acting as if tending to the country’s needs should come on his own schedule.\nOn Jan. 19, Mr. Buhari left for a 10-day holiday to London; it seemed odd to leave the warmth of Abuja for the misery of English winter. By early February, Nigerians were told that Mr. Buhari had extended his trip for unspecified medical tests. No return date was given. Who can begrudge a 74-year-old the medical tests he is said to be undergoing in London?\nIf only Mr. Buhari had invested in the human resources and infrastructure required to conduct such medical examinations and treatments in Nigeria. Every year around 60,000 Nigerians seek medical treatment abroad, mostly in India and Dubai. Women who have a choice will spend every penny for maternity services abroad. People in Lagos openly talk of hospitals rationing supplies for those who have to go there.\nWhen he first took the reins of government from Goodluck Jonathan, who governed during an oil boom, Mr. Buhari lamented that he found an empty treasury, that Nigeria faced millions of dollars in debt and wasn’t even able to pay civil servant salaries.\nAs Africa’s largest oil producer, Nigeria was hit hard by the global collapse in oil prices; crude is responsible for more than 90 percent of its exports and 70 percent of its government revenues. Oil prices plunged sharply, from close to $100 a barrel in 2015 to about $70 a barrel now, after recently climbing again.","1":"https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/02/17/opinion/the-case-of-nigerias-missing-president.html","2":"434","3":"Politics","4":"2","5":"en","6":"0.9999885559"},{"0":"President Goodluck Jonathan has expressed hope that his government will not fail but rather the nation will change for good during his administration.\nPresident Jonathan was speaking at a national breakfast meeting which held at the banquet hall of the presidential villa, to intercede for the nation.\nThe president said he and his team may not have been the best hands for the job, but that God knows why he put them at the helm of affairs in Nigeria, pledging to do his best in the transformation of the country.\nThe President noted that by God’s grace this government will not fail and was very optimistic that the nation will change for good.\nHe says he will always make supplications to God for his emergence as president, pledging to do his best in the transformation of the country.","1":"http://www.channelstv.com/home/2012/04/14/jonathan-calls-on-god-to-transform-nigeria/","2":"160","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999523163"},{"0":"EssayWriter.pro is a leading custom writing service that provides essay writing services to students across all academic levels.\nWith over 25 years of experience in the industry, the company has remained a reliable source for students seeking professional essay writing assistance.\nThis review will provide a comprehensive look into the services provided by EssayWriter.pro and help students make an informed decision about using the platform.\nEssayWriter.pro boasts a qualified team of professional writers with experience in handling a wide range of topics.\nHiring writers from various academic fields ensures that the writers are familiar with the exact needs of students.\nFor instance, the writers are able to tailor the essay to a specific citation style as well as the composition of the essay.\nIt also guarantees that the cardstock is written with the student in mind and is a thorough representation of their ideas.\nThe website has a very straightforward interface that allows users to easily find their way around.\nIt is designed to help students of all levels of writing expertise and proficiency.\nThe structure of each order is well organized and helps the user go through the steps in a quick and effective way.\nWith EssayWriter.pro, students are guaranteed to receive a high-quality piece of work for their assignments.\nFrom the design to the content, EssayWriter.pro guarantees that each essay provided is of a high level of quality.\nAll essays are checked for originality before submission.\nThe company utilizes several plagiarism checking software to ensure that the student does not submit the same content twice and that the content is authentic.\nThis ensures that students get an essay that is unique and tailored to their instructions.\nEssayWriter.pro also takes customer privacy and confidentiality seriously.\nThe customer’s personal information is kept secure and kept confidential.\nThis allows customers to have peace of mind knowing that their information is always safe.\nOverall, EssayWriter.pro is a reliable and trusted source for essay writing services.\nThe experienced team of professional writers handle each essay with the utmost care and ensure that the student receives the best quality papers possible.\nWith a secure and easy-to-use interface, students of all levels of writing expertise can benefit from the services provided by EssayWriter.pro.\nTutoriage.com is one of the leading online essay writing services, providing fast and efficient help to students all around the world.\nTheir team of highly qualified and experienced writers and editors are dedicated to helping students with their academic work and offering well-written research papers, essays, reports, and other written assignments.\nTutoriage.com has proven to be a reliable essay writing provider and has earned good reviews from customers.\nThe writers at Tutoriage.com have a strong academic background and provide quality work that meets all academic requirements.\nMost papers are delivered on time, with each paper being customized to meet the customer’s individual requirements.\nThe payment system at Tutoriage.com is secure and confidential, providing customer assurance and peace of mind.\nFurthermore, the customer support team is always available to answer any inquiry and provide additional assistance if needed.\nOverall, Tutoriage.com provides a great service and a great review.

But I hope that someone, who by chance reads it, would whisper these recommendations to them: (1) The APC should not imitate the Peoples Democratic Party in jettisoning zoning. (2) APC should ignore the lure of northernization that comes with the abandonment of zoning. (3) The party should go for a Southern candidate that could muster the widest voter spread across the country, especially among the masses.\nAlthough the PDP presidential primary was well planned and well executed, the outcome was not without rancour in the South. Southern leaders (the Southern Governors Forum, Traditional and Religious leaders, and Sociocultural Organisations), who had canvassed zoning the presidential position to the South felt cheated and betrayed. In particular, the hotbed of PDP in the South (South-south and South-east) was so upset that the party’s flag bearer, Atiku Abubakar, quickly embarked on appeasement and reconciliation mission. How he can appease the South-east, whose leaders warned its politicians against accepting a Vice-Presidential slot, remains to be seen. So far, Atiku and PDP national leaders have been afraid to even consider someone from the Southeast for the slot, even though one was chosen in 2019.\nPDP did not just abandon zoning. It did it in an in-your-face manner. Here’s how the South-east socio-cultural group, Ohaneze Ndigbo reacted: “the PDP is now a political party for the Northern region, with Dr Iyorchia Ayu (Benue) as PDP Chair, Walid Jubril (Nasarawa) as BOT (Board of Trustees) Chair, and Atiku Abubakar (Adamawa) as 2023 PDP presidential candidate,” As if to complete the oppression of the South, another Northerner, Senator David Mark, supervised the PDP presidential primary. No wonder then that, within hours, Southern, Middle Belt, and South-south leaders rejected Atiku as PDP candidate. At the end of the day, this may well be a bluff. However, it cannot go without some repercussions for the PDP.\nIf there is a lesson the APC should learn from the PDP convention, it is not to abandon zoning but to go South as it originally planned. The argument leading to the election of party officials was that the 2015/2019 arrangement was being reversed, implying that the Party Chairman would now go to the North, while the Presidential candidate would go to the South. Accordingly, the party chairmanship was successfully zoned to the North. If they still exist, the intrigues that led to a stalemate in implementing the promised zoning of the presidential candidate to the South should be ignored, if the APC hopes to win the election.\nAnother factor the APC should consider in favour of the South is the role of the legacy parties that formed the APC. Many commentators have drawn attention to the role of the Action Congress of Nigeria, which had as many Governors (6) as the other legacy parties, ANPP (3), APGA (2), and CPC (1). It was the ACN that delivered victory to then candidate Muhammadu Buhari, who had previously run unsuccessfully for the same office three times. It speaks volume to the character of a person or group that ignores this history and the accompanying ethical bond in order to hold on to power. In the final analysis, it may well be suicide for the APC to ignore the South, especially the Southwest, the hotbed of ACN until the formation of the APC. Fortunately, the APC is not short of good candidates from this zone.\nIn his column yesterday, Festus Eriye exposed the fallacy of the idea that only a Northern APC candidate can defeat Atiku, who is also from the North, or that the North is a monolithic voting bloc (see APC’s 2023 options: Facts and fallacies, The Nation, May 31, 2022). Granting that Atiku will be able to cart away some votes, APC should be the party to beat in the APC should still be the party to beat in the region. After all, it has 13 of the region’s 19 Governors currently in power. Equally unfathomable is the idea of another Northerner succeeding President Buhari in the same party after an 8-year tenure. Not only is it an insult on Southern sensibilities, it robs deep on the fragility of our democracy.\nHere’s where the PDP does not offer a model for the APC to follow. For one thing, the last PDP President was from the South. Therefore, the rotational principle might operate differently for the party. That’s one reason the same Atiku was their candidate in 2019. True, the idea of matching Buhari with a Northern candidate was in the consideration, that, too, should not be a model for the APC, whose Northern candidate would have been in power for eight years by 2023.\nStill lurking in the background of the ongoing presidential primary process is the new political fad, consensus. There are at least three indications that the APC might be working toward a consensus presidential candidate. First, attached to the nomination and expression of interest form is a consensus form, which many aspirants ignored. Second, the aspirants were asked during the screening if they would agree to a consensus candidate. Again, not all aspirants agreed to the arrangement. Finally, as recently as last evening, Tuesday, May 31, 2022, the President met with the APC Governors and shared with them his “dream” of the “ideal candidate” he would like them to consider.\nIt is no longer the President’s body language. Now it is his dream. It remains unclear where either or both could lead. What is clear is that the President has just given the party leaders another goal to pursue—his dream of the ideal candidate. A categorial statement on zoning could limit the sphere of this wild goose chase. There is no better leadership the President can give on the presidential electoral process at this time than such a statement. If and when he makes the statement, the keyword should be South.\n- This column was not published on the back page yesterday due to a mix up.","1":"https://thenationonlineng.net/why-the-apc-should-head-south-2/?utm_term=Autofeed&utm_medium=Social&utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1654145564","2":"1352","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999961853"},{"0":"By Gbenga Olarinoye, Osogbo\nThe Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, runner-up in the last Osun state congress, Dr Akin Ogunbiyi said the party’s governorship candidate Senator Ademola Adeleke should blamed for the breakdown in the peace talk between them.\nAddressing his party supporters weekend, in his country home, Ile-Ogbo, Dr Ogunbiyi stated that, Senator Adeleke flagrantly failed to honour all the three conditions given to him to meet by the national leaders of the party for peace to reign in the party in the state.\nAccording to him, the leadership of the party in Abuja summoned the two of them to a peace talk after the crisis that trailed the party’s primary where Adeleke defeated Ogunbiyi by a margin of seven votes.\nHe said at the Abuja meeting Senator Adeleke was asked to concede the post of his running mate to Ogunbiyi’s group, the senatorial seat to the group and also shared both the national and state assemblies legislatures.\n“At that meeting, I never asked that any condition should be met or I should be refunded for all my expenses or we should share posts. It is in the wisdom of the party leaders that came up with those conditions and the two parties agreed with them”. he said.\nDr Ogunbiyi explained further that all efforts by his group to make Adeleke fulfill his side of the agreement did not see the light of the day.\nAs the national Secretariat of the party ordered former Senate President, Senator David Mark and senate President, Dr Bukola Saraki to mediate in the crisis, Dr Ogunbiyi said the mediators need not come to him as he had obeyed all the directives of the party.\nHis words: ” I believe in the party suppremacy and I don’t have any litigation in any court against him. So, when they come they should see Adeleke and ask him questions.\nHe directed his followers to go out and work for the success of the party in all the future elections saying that he has no plan to leave the party.\nWhen Senator Adeleke was contacted for his reaction to Dr Ogunbiyi’s allegations, he said they are still talking.\nAdeleke who reacted through his media aid, Olawale Rasheed said, “There is nobody that loses election without a bit of anger.But this is a family affair.Dr Akin Ogunbiyi has affirmed that he is not leaving the party.\n“He also expressed readiness to work for the success of the party.The rest is politics.The focus now is the preparation for September 22.

The PDP candidate also called for the suspension of the exercise over violence and vote buying.

But my heart sang with proprietary pride when I saw how beautifully the Benue artefacts and archive film footage had been presented and when I heard foreigners enthusiastically praising them.\nThe whole package was a stunning, mood-lifting tribute to the best of Middle Belt history; and I looked forward to personally congratulating Gabriel Suswam, the Governor of Benue State, who was expected to grace the occasion.\nBut guess what? He never showed up! The MC announced his name and the audience eagerly clapped as they anticipated him mounting the podium and speechifying. But there was no sign of him. He didn’t even send a representative.\nI wished the ground would open up and swallow me when one of the foreigners who was standing next to me scathingly remarked that we shouldn’t really be surprised because Nigerian VIPs are notoriously unreliable and ill-mannered.\nNa wa for the political Master of Makurdi for missing a golden and rare opportunity to make his state shine on the international stage!\nOK, so let me grudgingly give him the benefit of the doubt and concede that he may have had a sound reason for failing to make an appearance at a party at which he was supposed to be the Star Guest. But this thing about letting people who are waiting for you down is pretty typical of Naija dignitaries.\nAnd, let’s face it: More often than not, this penchant for failing to honour commitments is caused by uncouthness, arrogance and inefficiency…rather than by genuine difficulties or factors beyond their control. They simply get into the habit of regarding themselves as demi-gods and treating others shabbily…though most of them are mediocres who would not get to the top in civilized societies where thieves, thugs and election-riggers become jailbirds not leaders!\nI left the exhibition venue with a sour taste in my mouth and shaking my head sadly and praying that Suswam would later apologise profusely to the organisers.\nBy the way, I also went to see the “Fela!” (Anikulapo-Kuti) musical while I was in Washington; and it was an enjoyable theatrical extravaganza that was extremely well-received. But it was funded and created by Americans. And I keep wondering why a Nigerian impresario did not come up with this brilliant idea first…and then persuade an indigenous multi-millionaire to finance it.\nA few thoughts\nI WANT to express immense gratitude towards the many Vanguard readers who responded sympathetically to my anguished lament about the fact that Oliver, my adored teenage son, left home for a distant boarding school last week.\nI have derived so much comfort and strength from the wise advice and warm commiserations you kindly sent me via email and text. May God bless you all. But, at the risk of sounding as if I am too selfish, too weak and too emotionally immature to react philosophically to a separation that everyone around me swears will greatly enhance my child, I have to say that I do not accept the widespread belief in this country that our offspring must fly away from the maternal nest before they can truly commence the process of becoming adults.\nIn Nigeria, most kids are despatched to boarding schools as soon as they complete their primary-level educations. Here, I was regarded as overly clingy and somewhat eccentric for refusing to let go of Oliver until he was l6.\nIn Britain, where I grew up, the reverse is true. There, the majority of youngsters live with their parents full-time until they leave their non-residential secondary schools and start work or go to university, art college or whatever.\nAnd, interestingly, my Nigerian friends who went to boarding schools are not necessarily less spoiled, less self-indulgent or less skilled at coping with tough challenges than my British friends who went to day schools. I myself went to a boarding school and I’m less disciplined and less adept at surviving life’s shark-infested waters than some of my contemporaries who weren’t boarders.\nGiven that the personalities people wind up with boil down more to their basic natures than to the form of schooling they went through, why do Nigerians constantly insist that boarding schools are “definitely” character-building?\nOne thing I’ve noticed about Africans is that we are often too quick to base our convictions on irrational theories and prejudices rather than hard facts.\nMeanwhile, almost every shameless looter of public funds who has impoverished this nation went to a boarding school! Ditto almost every woman who has greedily sold her body to buy luxuries like diamonds that she doesn’t need…and almost every cultist or killer who has terrorised his fellow citizens.\nFrankly, even though there are good folks in Nigeria and bad folks in Britain, the British are, on the whole, less prone to misbehaviour than we are; and I have plenty of British friends who despite not leaving home until they were l8, possess high moral standards and characters that are strong in the right way.\nAnd the question I want to ask is this: Given that there is no proof that products of boarding schools are inevitably superior to products of day schools, how can the Nigerians who nagged me to send Oliver away be so absolutely sure that he will emerge from the boarding school experience as a better person?!\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"https://www.vanguardngr.com/2020/12/world-bank-says-nigerias-1-5-bn-budget-support-loan-request-still-in-the-works/amp/the","2":"1212","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.999994278"},{"0":"Reading this on your mobile?

We have not studied the technology, this is just what consumers think,\" she added.\nMeanwhile she predicts that evolving technologies could also allow customers to enhance their leisure time.\n\"Just imagine watching football and being able to choose from where you want to see the game from different places in the stands, or perhaps even from the pitch. Shopping is also an area where you could [virtually] try on shoes and see how they fit on your own feet,\" said Ångström.\nThe research also suggests that customers are becoming less likely to ditch companies if they are disappointed with the service they receive, and more likely to use social networks to seek change.\n\"Previously it has been the case that when consumers are not happy they vote with their feet. But now 32 percent think that the best way to get a company to transform itself is by posting on the company's social media channels,\" said Ångström.\nIn a separate statement, Michael Björn, Head of Research, Ericsson ConsumerLab, added: \"Some of these trends may seem futuristic. But consumer interest in new interaction paradigms such as AI and virtual reality (VR), as well as in embedding the internet in the walls of homes or even in our bodies, is quite strong.

He told the court that in spite of the court order earlier made, restraining parties from publishing anything outside the courtâ€™s proceedings, Steve Ogwu was still publishing extraneous stories indicating that there was indeed an act of murder committed by the complainants.\nHe drew the attention of the court to Section 133 (4)(9) of the Criminal Code which gave the court the power to restrain parties to conduct themselves only within the ambit of the court.\nAccording to him, the publication by pointblanknews.com was meant to dent the image of the court and also prejudice the case pending before the court. He noted that the accused persons were charged for conspiracy, stealing and obtaining money under false pretense, wondering why the online publication, which he said Steve Ogwu was their agent, was alleging murder.\nAt this juncture, the prosecutor called the attention of the court to reference of the publication over ritual murder and stated to the bewildered court, â€œeven the alleged victim of the so-called ritual murder is here, physically present in court.\nWith the permission of this honorable court, I will ask the boy to come out to the court.â€\nHe cautioned that if the court allowed further publication of extraneous stories, it would rubbish the case before the court. He urged the court to make a definite order restraining the repeat of such publication.\nIn his response, counsel to Steve Ogwu, Giwa-Amu denied that his client was responsible for the publications. He also alleged that Vanguard had equally published stories which cast him and his client in bad light.\nAlso, Mr Okunniyi representing Alayande denied the involvement of his client in the publication in pointblanknews.com\nAt this stage, the presiding Magistrate queried whether the prosecutor investigated that indeed the first accused person was behind the publication.\nEarlier, Mr. Okuniyi had apologised for the absence of his client in court, stating that he was indisposed and that he had to travel abroad for treatment. Magistrate Okusanya however frowned at the absence of the suspect without informing the court.\nReacting to the controversies over the publications, the Magistrate in her short ruling held that further publications on the case must be limited to the proceedings of the day.\nThe Magistrate adjourned further hearing in the case till July 23, 2009.\nThe charges against the accused persons reads-\n*â€œThat you Steve Chinua, â€˜mâ€™, Alhaji Rasheed Alayande â€˜mâ€™ and others now at large on the same date, time and place in the aforesaid magisterial district did with intent to defraud obtain from one Oyindamola Amuka â€˜fâ€™, the sum of N4 million on the pretext that you are treating her child that was sick, a fact you know to be false and thereby committed an offence punishable under section 419 of the Criminal Code Cap c17, Vol II, Laws of Lagos state of Nigeria, 2003.\n* That you Steve Chinua, â€˜mâ€™, Alhaji Rasheed Alayande â€˜mâ€™ and others now at large on the same date, time and place in the aforesaid magisterial district did steal the sum of N4 million, property of one Oyindamola Amuka â€˜fâ€™ and thereby committed an offence publishable under section 390 (9) of the Criminal Code Cap C.17, Vol II, Laws of Lagos State of Nigeria, 2003.\n* That you Steve Chinua, â€˜mâ€™, Alhaji Rasheed Alayande â€˜mâ€™ and others now at large on the same date, time and place in the aforesaid magisterial district did with intent to extort money from one Oyindimola Amuka, cause a publication of a defamatory matter on pointblanknews website, dated Sunday, December 21, 2008 and thereby committed an offence punishable under section 376 of the Criminal Code Cap C.17, Vol II, Laws of Lagos State of Nigeria.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"http://www.vanguardngr.com/2009/06/25/drama-as-alleged-ritual-murder-victim-surfaces-in-court/","2":"1430","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999790192"},{"0":"President Muhammadu Buhari on Saturday said Nigeria is ready to assist Germany to defeat terrorism.

Hon. Aminu Tambuwal.\nThe opposition party said government would be pouring petrol on naked fire if Tambuwal was arrested. The warning was issued on a day the National Security Adviser, Sambo Dasuki, and the police denied that any move to arrest the Speaker was being contemplated.\nMeanwhile, the Presidency washed its hands off the Thursday’s police invasion of the National Assembly to stop the Speaker and his colleagues from gaining access into the parliament.\n”Published reports have corroborated what we know: That the plan on Thursday was to prevent Tambuwal from entering the National Assembly to pave the way for his Deputy, Emeke Ihedioha, who had already been allowed into the House, to preside over the removal of the Speaker. Were it not so, why would the police even try to seize the mace from the Sergeant-at-arms, as reported? Why would the police detain the Sergeant-at-arms for his refusal? What is the business of the police with the mace, which is the House’s symbol of authority?,”the APC said, yesterday, in a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Alhaji Lai Mohammed.\nThe statement went on: ”It has also now been corroborated that the plan hatched by the PDP and the Presidency was to give Tambuwal the ”Ekiti treatment”, in which seven PDP members removed the Speaker in a 26-member House of Assembly. But for the quick thinking and action by the honorable members who scaled the gate to access the assembly, that plan would have succeeded and Tambuwal would have been removed as Speaker, the consequences of which no one would have been able to foretell.\n”Therefore, instead of pillorying those who scaled the gate, we should be commending them for risking their lives to save our democracy. Those who shut the gate against the lawmakers and barred them from carrying out their constitutional duties are the villains, not the honorable members who acted in the nation’s interest.”\nThe opposition party said the “ceaseless hounding of Tambuwal by President Goodluck Jonathan and the PDP is patently provocative, to say the least, and calls into question the stated commitment of the Jonathan administration to the rule of law.”\n”In the eyes of the law, Rt. Hon. Tambuwal remains the Speaker of the House of Representatives, despite his defection from the PDP to the APC. No matter what the PDP and the Presidency may feel, they are not the court of law, which is the only body that can make a definite pronouncement on the fate of the Speaker,” the APC argued.\n”The Speaker also remains the number two man in the hierarchy of the legislative arm of government, which is distinct from the executive arm headed by the President. It is therefore not only unconstitutional but also anti-democratic and anarchic for the PDP-led government of President Goodluck Jonathan to continue to hound the Speaker and desecrate the hallowed chambers of the National Assembly, using the police force that has now become the enforcement arm of the ruling party, having dropped all pretences to neutrality and professionalism.”\nThe party said at a time the political atmosphere has become so charged by the government-backed police assault on the National Assembly, it is a perilous game to seek to arrest the Speaker, for whatever reason, unless of course the administration is bent on deliberately plunging the nation into crisis.\n”It is difficult to fathom the reason behind the government’s increasing resort to recklessness, but it may not be unconnected with the rising desperation by the ruling PDP to hold on to power at all cost. Perhaps now that it has started seeing the handwriting on the wall with Nigerians clamouring for change, this government may be tilting towards its last option of throwing the nation into crisis to prevent the 2015 elections from holding.\n”We are therefore calling on all men and women of good conscience, especially those who have the ears of the President, to prevail on him not to push the nation into any worse crisis than it is currently encountering. With terrorists daily killing and maiming Nigerians, forcing more than 1.5 million people to flee their homes and threatening the nation’s territorial integrity, the government’s trifling is baffling, and should stop forthwith.”\n‘Security agents raided APC offices’\nThe party, also yesterday, alleged that its offices in Lagos were raided by security agents who, it claimed, destroyed a dozen computers.\nThe APC condemned the alleged invasion it called “perhaps the worst political scandal in Nigeria’s history”, and demanded independent inquiry to fish out those behind it.\nGiving details of the invasion, the APC, in another statement, said, in the early hours of yesterday, a combined team of men of the DSS and OP-MESA stormed the Bola Ajibola Data Centre belonging to the APC in the Ikeja area of Lagos and arrested 25 APC data agents and three security guards.\n”In what was a gestapo-like operation, the APC membership data centre located at Number 10, Bola Ajibola Street, off Allen Avenue, Ikeja, came under siege between the hours of 5:30 am and 7:30 am on Saturday. An operation of terror and brigandage was unleashed on a legitimate operation of a leading national party. They came without a search warrant for the premises. Over 50 security operatives drafted from Abuja operations blocked the two major street entrances to the APC data entry centre, pulled down the gates and spent over 2 hours ransacking and vandalizing the centre”, the party said.\n”More than a dozen computers were destroyed. The server was also vandalized along with other equipment in the building. Just like the Watergate Scandal in the USA, the state-sponsored security operatives apparently acting at the behest of the ruling PDP government, turned the office upside down, and pulled out and vandalized everything in sight.\n”If the PDP-led government and the security agents had done due diligence and acted professionally, they would have known that the APC data centre is a legitimate operation and the staff are Nigerian youths who were left jobless by the Jonathan government. Apart from the Lagos centre, the operation is decentralized and similar centres are functional in about six different locations around the country.\n”They chose to believe the lie that it was a warehouse belonging to one of the national leaders of the party where dangerous weapons were being kept, when in fact it is a centre for entering the data provided by the millions of Nigerians who registered as members of the party during its membership registration exercise.”\nIt described the invasion as another act of impunity.\nAPC called the invasion of the offices an attempt to suppress the opposition, get details of its membership with the intention of using it to rig the 2015 elections and also to destroy the spirit of democracy.\n”When on Oct. 6, 2013, we issued a statement alerting Nigerians that the Jonathan administration was using Rivers State as a testing ground for creeping fascism ahead of the 2015 elections, some said we were raising a false alarm, “the party said.\n”Well, here we are. In the past five months, the PDP-led government has stepped up its acts of impunity and terror against the leaders of the APC and all non-PDP actors. Elected officers, who are not PDP members, have had their rights repeatedly violated by the police and other security operatives. Never before has an elected government been so scared of the opposition to the point of shutting it down.\n”Now that they have overreached themselves by attacking the offices of the main opposition party and destroying part of its membership database, can the PDP-led government still claim to be operating under the rule of law? Can the government sincerely tell the world it is now ready for free and fair elections in 2015? This is one impunity too many, and we will not allow it to be swept under the carpet.”\n`No arrest order’\n“In apparent reference to the arrest move claim, the Office of the NSA, yesterday, described as unfair and total falsehood “the report in some media that the National Security Adviser (NSA), Sambo Dasuki, ordered the arrest of Aminu Waziri Tambuwal at a meeting with Vice President Namadi Sambo and Inspector General of Police Suleman Abba”.\nThe Director, Special Duties in the Office of NSA, Colonel Bello Fadile (rtd), stated this in a statement.\n“It is not only untrue and mere fabricated reports that the NSA met with the VP and ordered the arrest of Hon Tambuwal, the fact is that the National Security Adviser, Sambo Dasuki, has been outside the country since Wednesday on pressing national security issues”, the statement said.\n“To the best of our knowledge, there is no order for the arrest of Hon. Aminu Waziri Tambuwal of the House of Representatives.\n“We therefore urge the media to always cross-check their stories before going to press.”\nPolice spokesman, DCP Emmanuel Ojukwu, also denied any move to arrest Tambuwal.\n“It lies with the investigators to determine who should be quizzed and/or prosecuted, as the case may be for criminal acts”, Ojukwu stated.\n‘Leave Jonathan out of NASS invasion’\nYesterday, the Presidency said Jonathan did not authorise the Thursday’s police invasion of the National Assembly.\n“The matter is being investigated; we should await the outcome of the investigations and so I urge that we should all refrain from saying anything that may be prejudicial, partisan or uninformed as some people are already doing, which may then turn out to be incorrect. But I can tell you that President Jonathan did not authorise any form of assault on the National Assembly. He has no hand in it. The police authorities themselves have said that they acted on their own, based on information that some thugs were planning to cause mayhem and compromise the safety of lawmakers. Let the police explain exactly what happened. And they have said they will. This is certainly not about President Jonathan. He has a very excellent relationship with the National Assembly”, Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Dr Reuben Abati, told Sunday Vanguard in an interview.\nSenate Minority Whip condemns invasion\nIn a related development, the Senate Minority Whip and Chairman of the upper legislative chamber Committee on Capital Market, Senator Ganiyu Olanrewaju Solomon (GOS), condemned in strongest terms the parliament invasion.\nSolomon, running for governor in Lagos State on the platform of the APC said in Lagos, yesterday, that the police attack on the federal lawmakers was the height of executive lawlessness and interference.\nHe noted that the invasion of the hallowed chambers was a signal that the police might not be impartial in the February 2015 general election.\nThe front-runner aspirant called on the Inspector-General of Police, Suleiman Abba, to maintain neutrality in political matters and remain impartial in contests among the political parties.\nSolomon, who was a member of the House of Representatives before being elected to the Senate, pointed out that the issue of the defection and speakership of Tambuwal should be left to the members to resolve and not the executive coming into it to muscle him out of office.\nSpeaking in the same vein, yesterday, a former Lagos State Commissioner of Police, Alhaji Abibakar Tsav, lamented that officers of the police were being reduced to thugs by desperate politicians, to breach the laws of Nigeria.\nTsav cautioned: “The use of the police against perceived opposition will usher in anarchy”.\nHe said what was exhibited at the National Assembly, on Thursday, was not only disgraceful and shameful but showed immaturity and intolerance by the Peoples\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"http://www.vanguardngr.com/2014/11/dont-arrest-tambuwal-apc-warns/","2":"2588","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.999956131"},{"0":"A group, known as the Northern Liberal Democratic Movement (NLDM) has called on the presidential candidate of the opposition New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP), Senator Rabiu Kwankwaso to withdraw from the race for the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Alhaji Atiku Abubakar.\nAccording to the group, the mood and opinion of stakeholders in the region and the country were in favour of Atiku who it stated was in a better position to win the contest irrespective of the former governor Kano’s decision.\nThis is contained in a statement issued to newsmen in Abuja by the National Secretary of the movement, Hon Balarabe Ali Bello on Thursday.\nIn the statement, Bello stated that apart from the mood of the people of the region, the current reality is prompting scores of many chieftains and members of the NNPP to dump the party for the PDP across the region in anticipation of a likely Atiku victory in February.\nThe NNPP has in the last few weeks lost its chieftains to the PDP with the recent being the Deputy Governorship Candidates of the party in Niger and Yobe State, so also the state chairman of the party in Kaduna and the Zonal secretary of the party in the North East zone. These chieftains defected with scores of their supporters.\nPrior to that, no fewer than 700,000 members of the party defected to PDP in Bauchi state, North East zone of the country prompting many stakeholders in the region to urge Kwankwaso to throw in the towel in favour of the former Vice President Atiku Abubakar whom many see as well placed to win the February’s election.\n“I am joining other well-meaning Northerners to urge our brother, His Excellency, distinguished Sen.

They want to nominate candidates from their states to enable them have a firmer grip on the party at the grassroots.\nMultiple sources told The Nation that the President is determined to hit the ground running this time around by forming his cabinet within weeks of his swearing in.\nThe situation has sparked intense lobbying by party chieftains including governors and ministers for ministerial slots .\nSome outgoing governors, it was gathered, are allegedly working round the clock to replace the current ministers from their various states in the FEC.\nThe affected governors have reportedly contacted some prominent party leaders to indicate interest in their states’ ministerial slot and possibly make a case for them at the highest level possible.\nThe President is keeping his plan close to his chest but some party leaders say the situation unfolding in the state will make it difficult for the President to personally nominate all members of his next cabinet.\nThe party leaders spoke of massive political intrigues in “some of our states, especially states where the outgoing governors want to serve as ministers.”\n“Many of the ministers feel they have done well enough to be given a second chance. Currently, both parties are making moves to corner the ministerial slots of their various states,” a source said.\nContinuing, the source said: “The body language of the president is such that nobody can predict where the pendulum will swing. I can tell you of a Southwest state where many people will vow that President Buhari will give the outgoing governor a place in his next cabinet and others will strongly argue that the current minister from the state will retain his place in the next cabinet. And both of them are openly scheming for the state’s slot by lobbying party leaders and other stakeholders.\n“In another state in the north, the outgoing governor and the minister are both holding meetings with party chieftains to explain why they should be given the state’s ministerial slot to occupy.\n“Their ambitions have divided the party as their supporters are now lining up behind their preferred candidates.\n“Party leaders in the state recently came out to call for caution over the matter. Both the governor and the minister have also been coming here to lobby party leaders.”\nThe Nation also learnt that many of the ministers have been celebrating the President’s directive that they should continue in office till May 28.\n“They see it as a subtle vote of confidence in them. They are more optimistic now that they may have actually earned the President’s trust,” another source said.\n“And if you listened to what the President said about why he didn’t overhaul his team, you may want to agree with those interpreting his directive as an endorsement.”\nBut many of the governors eyeing their state’s slot are also relying on their relationship with the President to clinch the job.\nWhile some are certain that with the efforts they put into ensuring Buhari’s re-election in their states and the words of commendation they got from him before, during and after the elections, others are banking on the interaction they had with Buhari when he came to their states to commission projects.\nThe Nation also gathered that the governors and ministers may have also taken their lobbying to the presidency in their bid to outwit one another.\nAccording to reliable sources, unsure of how the President will constitute his next team, many of those seeking places in the cabinet have been talking to close aides and associates of the President, urging them to put in words for them if the need arises.\n“It is normal to have ministerial hopefuls reach out to close aides and associates of the President for help. Don’t forget that President Buhari is one man you cannot predict easily.\n“He is keeping the issue of his next cabinet close to his chest for now. But one thing we can deduce from indications is that he may have plans to announce the next cabinet early. Whether he will call for inputs from party leaders and other stakeholders or he will handle the selection of the team alone is left to be seen,” another source said.\nThe Nation also gathered that there is palpable uncertainty over how the President will choose his team this time around as party leaders and other stakeholders await the mode the exercise will take.\n“We are still uncertain about who will be consulted for input into the next team. There was a time the President dropped the hint that the party will contribute to the selection of his next team. We are waiting to see how that will play out,” a source said.\nBut a senior party chieftains from the north-central insisted that the President is already consulting party leaders on the next cabinet. According to him, those involved in the struggle for the slots know those involved in the ongoing consultation and are reaching out to them as much as necessary.\n“It is those who don’t know that will say the President is not consulting leaders on the matter. Ask the outgoing governors and the ministers and they will tell you the various party leaders in their states or regions that they have gone to see on the matter,” he added.","1":"https://thenationonlineng.net/intrigues-as-govs-ministers-battle-for-buhari-cabinet-slots/","2":"1196","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999961853"},{"0":"A second republic senator has asked President Muhammadu Buhari to immediately resign from office and not wait until the coming general elections.\nProfessor Banji Akintoye made the call on Wednesday during his appearance on Channels Television’s Politics Today.\nREAD ALSO: Buhari Has Achieved More Than Obasanjo Did In Eight Years – Sagay\nThe former associate of late Obafemi Awolowo believes the President does not have the ability to manage the country’s economy, saying he would advise him to quit his job if he had the opportunity to meet him.\nHe noted that Nigeria has been evaluated as one of the countries with the highest rate of poverty, as well as one of the nations where citizens have the least access to basic amenities.\n“This president does not seem to know or understand Nigeria, does not seem to care about the suffering of people, and has no clue at all about managing the economy,” said Professor Akintoye.\n“If I were to stand in from of him, as a fellow citizen who belongs to my generation, I would say ‘brother, you can’t do this job’.\n“I will say to him, ‘my dear brother you cannot do this job; you have no idea (of) how to do it. Our country is perishing under you, I would advise that you resign (and) not even talk about standing election in 2019’. I think he should resign right now,” he added.\nThe elder statesman made the comments amid controversy and war of words that have accompanied a statement issued by former President Olusegun Obasanjo on Tuesday.\nObasanjo had in the 13-page statement, advised President Buhari not to seek re-election and called for a new movement to salvage Nigeria from its challenges.\nHe also said the Buhari government has failed the people, especially in one of the areas it pitched as its ‘key point of action’ when it assumed office in 2015 – the fight against corruption.\nAsked whether the claims made by the former President were true, Professor Banji said, “I think so; that’s another matter over which I agree with former President Obasanjo.”\nThe historian further criticised the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) as a ‘disintegrated’ party and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) as a one that is encouraging ‘corruption’.\nHe also faulted the Senate and called on Nigerians to ensure they elect lawmakers who would lead the country on the path of restructuring and ensure adequate security of lives and property.\n“APC is not a party, it’s just a contraption that was brought together to produce Buhari as president,” the second republic senator said. “After that, it (the party) disintegrated. Buhari is not using APC as a factor in a government.”\n“PDP has so mismanaged our lives in the past and has such a hideous record of corruption; to think that Nigerians will after one term vote for a party like PDP is egregious. No, it cannot happen – what should happen is what former President Obasanjo is suggesting.\n“Nigerians need to get together, put themselves together, and find a way to elect a totally different Senate in 2019 that will lead Nigeria – one, to restructure the country so that we can release all the tensions and two, to bring security into the land.

It is a system, whereby all monies belonging to the government are domiciled in one account with the Central Bank of Nigeria, with payments out and collection into the account done via an electronic payment platform.\nThe TSA became operational in 2012 with focus on payments, with a pilot phase involving 217 ministries, department and agencies (MDAs) in Abuja. Last year, the implementation was extended to all MDAs outside Abuja, hence all federal government related payments were executed via an electronic payment platform, Remita, an indegineous software developed by Systemspecs, a Nigerian software development company.\nVanguard investigation reveals that the extension of the epayment for government services under the TSA resulted into about N500 billion savings for the federal government in the form of unutilized funds under the 2014 budget. A source close to the TSA project confirmed this development to Vanguard. Speaking on condition of anonymity, he said that the N500 billion asegfqwould have been spent by the MDAs but they could not do so last year because of the use of electronic payment under the TSA. “You know with the e-payment, you cannot just collect money from the treasury, you have to go through the e-payment platform. The process requires you state who is collecting the money and why the money is being collected, and other information which would later be used to trace the money during audit. This helped curtailed misappropriation of funds and embezzlement which are conducted under various guises,” he said.\nAccording to Alhaji Salawu Adeku Zubairu, Director (Fiscal Account & Cash Mgt.) Funds Dept; Office of the Accountant-General of the Federation, one of the objectives of implementing the TSA, is to “iincrease internal controls to prevent and detect potential and actual fraud.”\nSpeaking on the implementation of the TSA, in a paper delivered at an e-payment conference, he said, “While this started with lots of resistance, many MDAs have come to appreciate the positive impact on their payment process. MDAs are now able to process transactions on their own taking responsibility and accountable for budget spending. The TSA has resulted into major reduction in Way and Means from CBN with funds saved used for other projects. It has also enhanced prompt disbursement of funds and payment to beneficiaries; and timely reporting of transactions, account balance and financial statement making it easy to monitor budget performance for decision making”.\nMeanwhile, the Federal government will this week release a circular and enlightenment booklet on the implementation of the electronic collection of revenue (e-Revenue) aspect of the TSA. Though the e-Revenue was scheduled to commence second quarter of last year, the implementation started in December with a pilot phase involving selected MDAs. Following the success of the pilot phase the federal government commenced full implementation on January 1st this year, with a directive to all MDAs to close all revenue accounts with banks by February 28. The circular and a booklet of Frequently Asked Questions on the new electronic revenue collection regime, which would be will be available at the registration desks of all Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) and project members’ banks, are aimed at enlightening the public and all interested stakeholders on the usage of electronic revenue collection platform aimed at checking theft, diversion of collected revenue and all sorts of corrupt practices associated with revenue collection.\nSpeaking last week at a workshop designed to sensitize MDAs to the commencement of the electronic revenue collection project. Accountant-General of the Federation, Mr. Jonah Otunla said that the implementation of the project which kicked-off on January 1, would enthrone a new regime of centralized, transparent and accountable internally generated revenue management system. As such, he asked that the balances in the revenue accounts should be transferred to the Consolidated Revenue Fund of the Federal Government, stating further that any MDA that failed to comply with the directive by the end of February would be sanctioned.\nOtunla said the new platform would improve the availability of funds for financing of developmental projects and budgets as well as plugging loopholes in government revenue collection and management.\nThe commencement of the e-collection platform, he informed, was a product of series of treasury reforms that began in 2012 and aimed at ensuring transparency and accountability in the management of the nation’s resources.\nAccording to him, the reforms have led to the introduction of the Government Integrated Financial Management Information System and the Treasury Single Account. “We have rolled out the GIFMIS and TSA implementation. At inception, a total of 93 agencies were enrolled and as of today, we have about 551, which is about three quarter of the total budget of the federation.\n”We have yet to realise the full potential of the reforms. Some big budget MDAs to with the National Assembly, National Judicial Council, the armed forces and some other autonomous agencies have been reluctant to be brought into the GIFMIS and TSA process.\n”The implication of this is that substantial cash resources of the government are still lying idle at a time when our cash flow is facing a lot of challenges. In the face of the cash flow problem, we need to be more creative. We can enhance the performance of the budget by either improving revenue or reducing costs.”\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"https://www.google.com.ng/amp/s/www.vanguardngr.com/2015/01/fg-saves-n500bn-through-implementation-of-single-treasury-account/amp/","2":"1182","3":"Politics","4":"2","5":"en","6":"0.9999847412"},{"0":"Dark web definition.\nThe dark web has become a place of mystery and a lot of horrible things are happening. However, the dark web is not far-fetched from accessing it with just a click of your fingertip. The dark web is the secret part of the internet not accessible by search engines like Google, Yahoo or Bing, and other popular search engines, it, however, requires specialized browsers to access it, normal browsers such as chrome and firefox are unable to access the dark because every website on the internet that is known ends with a '.com','.net' and various other types of extensions. The dark web website ends with '.onion' domain name, this makes it impossible to be accessed on a normal browser or for a search engine to index websites on the dark web. That is the simple reason why the dark web is hidden. You've heard people saying the dark web provides anonymity for its users, as opposed to the open internet. Yes, it does, everyone on the dark web is an unknown person hiding behind a face mask. Researchers have found out that the dark web is full of 57% percent illegal content. If you are looking for information about the dark web, then this article is for you. Keep reading to find out what the internet hides from us,\nWhat is the difference between the deep web and the dark web?\nFor you to completely understand the dark web you need to understand some technical definitions of terms, think of these terms as what will sail you through the Atlantic ocean for a better understanding of what the dark web is. The Internet is vast, with millions of web pages, and servers operating around the clock. However, the \"visible\" Internet can only be accessed using search engines such as Google, and others — is just a small fraction of the internet.\nThe Deep Web: The deep web is a layer of the internet accessible by everyone, but definitely through other tools such as the command line on the various operating systems and also specifically our browsers. The deep web could be considered the bottom of the ocean. when divers dive into the ocean they get to the bottom. The deep web in simple terms is the part of the internet not indexed by the search engine just like the dark web, however, the reason for it not being indexed is not because it could not be accessed by the browser as said earlier at the beginning of this article, but due to set of rules forbidden search engine from indexing it. Have you ever thought of how the cashiers in the bank work, or how the atm machine runs, that is the deep web? They involve internal services like the database admin login page( where the admin blocks users of social forums) and various other things the owner of a particular website might want to hide from you accessing. There are various tools for scrapping those deep web links, however, those are beyond the scope of this article. It would be an encouragement for you to subscribe to my authors' page and register on Vocal Media for me to create more deep knowledge articles on how to actually scrape the deep web. The deep web is not hidden like the dark web, they also include the internet of things, like you, when connecting your internal computer to your home router, the connection is kept between your computer and the router, the router is the only part exposed to the internet. That secret connection between your router, and your computer is the deep web.\nThe Dark Web: Unlike the deep web which is included in our day-to-day life the dark web is a segregated piece of the internet, not compared to the button ocean analogy but compared to something like outer space just like does famous Elon Musk StarShips. The dark web is a layer of interconnected IP addresses that is not accessible to the internet, here rules are not being made to keep admin pages secret, but they are literally not just accessible to us on the internet. It is however worthy to note that the dark web is also part of the deep web, it is like the core of the earth being exposed to space. If this look daunting a bit don't be scared about the explanation just keep reading on, you would understand at the end. Unlike the deep web which means anything behind a paywall, the dark web is a standalone internet created by open source foundations. Here are the basic rules of the dark web:\n1. No web browser such as Google Chrome can access it. except specialized dark web browsers made to access the dark web networks.\n2.“Internet proxy traffic” via a random methodology of routing traffic.\n3. Not accessible to browsers due to the encryption of its network node. A simple access to the dark web website would return an error on a normal browser.\nThis has cleared the difference on both webs. You probably want to check my video on the do's and don't of the dark web, right before you proceed way up above.\nThe surface is the internet accessible to me and you. Our daily lives revolve around it. It is also popularly known as the internet. This is the part of the internet that is indexed by big giant search engines and is also about 5% of the total internet. An example is our popular social media sites, Facebook.com, and various others. It is also worthy to note that the domain name of these our so-called-day-to-day internet always ends with \".com\"\nHow does the dark web work Using Tor as the dark web browser?\nTor is an anonymizing program that may be accessed using our conventional internet, known as the surface web. It is a tool used to access the dark web that may be downloaded from our regular internet. Tor is like an onion if you've ever seen one. It is like an onion that surrounds the sender's message with encryption. Internet entries or messages are not routed directly through the Tor network. They are instead routed through \"nodes,\" which are various computers set up by Tor users. There is a series connection at each node, where each node knows the address of the previous and next node but not the other nodes on the network. This is the ideal method to hide one's identity.\nWhy do people use the dark web and how to access it.\nThe dark web is a layer of the internet that requires some special skills to access. Firstly you need to keep yourself safe, by blocking out the camera on the computer system, so as not to get hackers from being creepy. Also, you need to connect to a VPN. The dark web uses a .onion domain name. For example \"facebookwkhpilnemxj7asaniu7vnjjbiltxjqhye3mhbshg7kx5tfyd.onion \" is the Facebook dark web version instead of \"facebook.com\". If you try to access the onion domain on your browser you would be faced with a glaring error, that you cannot access Facebook over the dark web using your normal browser. Try it, by inputting the dot onion domain name into your browser.\nHowever, you would need a browser called Tor for either your mobile device or your computer from https://www.torproject.org/download. Then you would need to access WikiLeaks (https://thehiddenwiki.org) to find a list of onion websites for different purposes. Do not go to illegal websites on the dark web as you may be arrested. You can search on 'the hidden wiki' on Google and then access the website. It shows you a list of services available on the dark web. However, that is not all of the dark webs. You or your friend may set up a charity or a good course website over the dark web only accessible by you both and hidden on the dark web.\nYou can also check an interesting video I made on youtube on how to access the dark web here:\nThe legality of the dark web / endquote\nThe reputation of the dark web has often been linked with the so-called \"illegal trading\" However, the dark web has also been used for the good course too for allowing journalists to share information without getting scared, and leaked secret papers for public safety. Even the first computer in the world does come with a disadvantage more or less of recent internet nowadays. You should however protect the computer from malware and spyware, they are personal to you, and you do not want your information littered over the internet. Hosting is done on the dark web just like any normal internet but only with specialized settings, you can however build your own simple website over the dark web. Keep Safe folks. You've made it to the end. Hurray.

Join Joseph Prince in this three part series as he explains the importance of prioritizing the wisdom of God in your everyday life.\nGod’s Wisdom Makes You Excel\nEver found yourself given a job, and feeling like you’re the least equipped person in the world to carry it out? Andy had such an experience. Not too long ago, he was appointed acting manager of a leading technological company in his home state of Colorado, US. On hearing this piece of news, half of him was delighted, the other half plain terrified. His first thought was, “How am I, a 20-year-old boy with not much working experience, going to run a well-known store, effectively lead some 90 employees—some of whom are more than twice my age— and bring in the expected profits?”\nThe young man was downright intimidated and he knew that he needed to seek God for wisdom. At the start of this job, Andy listened to one of my sermons on speaking God’s promises over his life. “This,” he wrote to tell me later, “gave me the insight to apply the spoken Word of God in my life.” I’ll let him tell you the resulting success he saw in his own words:\n“By constantly declaring scriptures on God’s promises, my mind was directed away from fears and into possibilities. God gave me favor with the higher management and I also gained the trust of my team as their new leader. He gave me innovative ideas that my company was able to apply at my store and these ideas are now used across the country. And to top it all off, our store had our two best quarters ever!”\nI want you to notice what Andy said. When the wisdom of God showed him how to apply the Word to his mountain of a situation, he began to see possibilities, not limits. The challenges were still there, but now he saw what he could do instead of being paralysed by what he thought he could not do. God’s wisdom and favor gave him influence with the management and his team. It also opened the door to a slew of brilliant ideas that became a blessing to his store and to the company, and sent his sales soaring to a whole new level! What an amazing outcome as a result of tapping into God’s wisdom.\nGod Wants To Give You Wisdom\nOne drop of God’s wisdom will show you what you need to do.\nAre you facing a situation where you’re conscious of the pressure on you or where giants loom large in the landscape? Maybe you’re a young person starting a business in a highly competitive industry dominated by big players. Perhaps you’ve been dealing with a disintegrating relationship with your spouse or child that seems to be getting worse. Or maybe you’re at a crossroad today—you have to make a decision that could change the direction of your life. Whichever the case, you’re crying out, “I don’t know what to do! Help!”\nMy friend, God wants to give you all the wisdom you need to excel in whatever it is you need to do. You may not be the most qualified, most experienced, most talented or most intelligent, but one drop of God’s wisdom will show you what you need to do and put you at the top of your game. Like Andy, you’ll not just survive, but you’ll also thrive. You’ll not just do well, but you’ll also excel!\nWisdom Above Knowledge\nPlease don’t get me wrong. I’m not against having paper qualifications, a high IQ or pursuing information and knowledge, but think about it: in this digital age we live in, we have a wealth of information at our fingertips and yet, despite the daily bombardment of information bits and bytes, it seems like many of us are more confused, stressed and depressed than ever.\nWhat we need is not more worldly knowledge and counsel, but wisdom that comes from God. There is counsel that comes from the world, but the Bible tells us the blessed man does not walk according to it. Instead, he walks according to God’s Word and wisdom. (Psalm 1:1–3) God’s wisdom, however, does not come by reading a lot of books, going for courses or getting the latest news and information. It comes from knowing the Lord and having Him lead you by His Spirit and His Word. And His wisdom is what the world is sorely lacking. It is what we need more and more of—every day and in every facet of life.\nPut Wisdom At The Top Of Your List\nIt’s no wonder God tells us the number one thing we should be pursuing every day is wisdom: “Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom. And in all your getting, get understanding.” (Proverbs 4:7) Let me give The Message translation, just for those who like making to-do lists: “Above all and before all, do this: Get Wisdom! Write this at the top of your list: Get Understanding!”\nMost of us, however, don’t seem to have “Get wisdom” on our daily to-do lists, or it’s just not at the top. We make time for anything and everything but wisdom: “Gym at 10am.” “Lunch with Pam at 12.30pm.” “Get Chelsea a dress for her birthday.” “Pick up kids at 5pm.” “Meet new client at mall, 7pm.”\nThere’s nothing wrong with pursuing the things we need to do for the day. But God wants us to prioritize His wisdom above everything else we set our hearts to pursue. The word “principal” in Proverbs 4:7 is the Hebrew word re’shiyth, which means “very first”, “best” and “chief”, telling us that in all our daily pursuits, getting wisdom is the most important and best thing we can do.\nYou see, if you seek the Lord’s wisdom first, He who knows all things will lead and help you do all the things you need to do for the day. Wouldn’t you prefer His kind of results over what your limited strength and intelligence can produce?\nHow can you lose, when you have the Lord’s wisdom flowing through you?\nMy friend, Jesus cares for you deeply and wants to bless all the work of your hands. He wants you to have fruitful days, not wasted days. He can tell you which body part needs more of a workout and which muscles need a rest, so you don’t suffer injuries. He can help you select the right dish from the menu since He knows that you’ve been wanting to lose some weight. He can help you pick out the right dress that your daughter will absolutely love, and at an affordable price too. He can give you wisdom and favor with your client, such that your client will be delighted to do business with you. How can you lose, when you have the Lord’s wisdom flowing through you in all that you set your hands to?\nPraise the Lord\nHow do I get the Wisdom of Lord?\nThank you Pastor.

I spent two days on the ground, meeting with all stakeholders.\n“Some of the shops at the time I visited 10 days ago have been opened. Some have not yet been opened. Opening of shops are still ongoing as we speak.\n“Those that have not been opened are locked because owners were not present at their shops. GUTA wants to open the shops in the owners presence.\n“With these shops opened, I can say that about 80-85 per cent of shops that were locked have been opened. We insisted that before shops are opened, the owners should be there.”\nThe envoy also dismissed reports that a Nigerian in Ghana, Mrs Stella Upaleke, committed suicide because of frustration occasioned by the closure of her shop.\n“I was with the regional police commander where the issue happened. The police statement, written by the husband and daughter of the woman, indicated that the suicide was not as a result of the lock-up of her shop,” he said.\nA former Secretary General of Nigerian Union of Traders Association Ghana (NUTAG), Mr Jasper Emenike, confirmed that some shops had actually been re-opened.\nHe, however, said that some Nigerian traders refused to show up because of harassment by Ghana Union of Traders Association (GUTA).\nEmenike therefore appealed to the Ghanaian authorities to reduce the cost of registering business and totally exempt Nigerian traders from the Ghana Investment Promotion Council (GIPC) Act.\nHe said that the charges were contrary to the spirit and letters of ECOWAS free movement protocol.\nHe also appealed that the government should stop the relocation of Nigerian traders from their shops.\n“We want to appeal that in furtherance to the efforts being made, there is need to put a permanent end to this issue.\n“There is also the need to stop charging Nigerian citizens I.D card fees, which cost 120 dollars for registration and 60 dollars for renewal every year,” he said\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"https://www.vanguardngr.com/2018/11/fg-summons-envoy-over-closure-of-nigerians-shops-in-ghana/","2":"889","3":"Politics","4":"2","5":"en","6":"0.9999885559"},{"0":"By Perez Brisibe\nKOKORI—SUCH were the authority and fame of the late Ubiecha Etarakpo, the founder of the historic African religion, Igbe, that the reigning Oba of Benin at the time had to travel incognito as a leper to Kokori, Ethiope East Local Government Area, Delta State, to validate his power.\nEtarakpo, who died in 1926, reportedly cured people of madness and healed men of various diseases even on his sick bed. He detected the undercover Benin monarch as he came in while an Igbe service was on and stood on his altar-like seat in acknowledgment.\nWorshipers in mortal realm could not fathom the forces at play, but Etarakpo ushered the “strange visitor” to his seat. Marvelling at his act, his members wondered if a tormenting spirit had possessed the sect’s founder, but after the Oba departed, Etarakpo told his bewildered congregation that the person, who just left was no less a person than the Benin monarch.\n“Three weeks after, the Oba visited Kokori again, this time, he came in his full regalia as an Oba and presented gifts and honoured Etarakpo for his spiritual prowess,” an unabashed Igbe worshiper told Niger Delta Voice at Kokori.\nHis words: “That was when people feared and respected the Igbe religion founded in the 19th century. More so, there was no division in the worship rites, as approved by the founder, Etarakpo, an indigene of Kokori.”\nEtarakpo allegedly received the call of “God” in 1893 and sat on the throne in 1920 with a female called Oniruesi, also known as Erukainure. According to myth, he went to the farm and fell into a trance after he ate a native chalk given to him during an encounter with a divine spirit. When he woke up from his trance, he became unconventional and acted strangely.\nBack at the community, a woman known as Oniruesi noticed something mysteriously divine about him, unlike others, who thought he had gone round the bend. Though he later got married to her, he resided in her apartment and continued dancing each passing day, eating nothing but Orhen (native chalk), healing people miraculously by praying for them and giving them the same native chalk to consume.\nA school of thought said Etarakpo, purportedly mentally imbalanced, was roaming the streets of Kokori when he got a divine call, knelt down along the road, closed his hand and eyes in prayer, went into a trance and when he woke up, he saw a native chalk in his hand.\nAs he marveled at how it came about, a divine spirit ministered to him on the efficacy and how to go about using the native chalk to heal people. This manifestation reportedly led to the beginning of Igbe. “Armed with the power of clairvoyance, Ubiecha’s deeds quickly spread far and wide with persons trooping to Kokori to consult him on their medical and spiritual problems,” the chief priest of Igbe, Chief Oberiko Omonemu, told Niger Delta Voice.\nBecause of the increase of Etarakpo’s followers, who were trooping to Kokori for consultation and healing, he later built a worship house known as Ogwa, where he ministered to his devotees and made prophesies with stunning accuracy.\nHowever, following his death in 1926, Igbe, described as Africa’s first monotheistic religion by the Urhobo Historic Society, UHS, had since split into over 50 denominations with some worshipping animals, mermaids and other divinities. The leadership crisis over who would step into his shoes started with three of his children: Igbe-Ibodje, Igbe-Akpokovo and Igbe-Emegalise.\nWelcoming Niger Delta Voice into his barely lit apartment at Kokori, Mr. Micheal Ejemedefe, who described himself as the life-bearer and final authority of Igbe, being the last link and descendant of the founder of Igbe, whose mother is the eldest daughter of Etarakpo’s second son, Akpokovo, took our team down memory lane on the intricacies that befell the religion.\nWorship of animals\nAccording to him, following the demise of Etarakpo and the birth of the three circuits of Igbe, various offshoots like Igbe-Ubiecha, Igbe-Oghene-Uku, Igbe-Agege and Osanuge-Igbe emerged.\nHe said the offsprings gave birth to the proliferation of Igbe with most of them involved in the culture of mermaids and other divinities, while others even indulge in the worship of animals, which they describe as the custodian of the spirit of “God.”\nWe believe in Jesus\nEjemedefe bellowed the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth while making a point prompting the reporter to ask what darkness has to do with light. He explained: “The main Igbe worshipers believe in Jesus Christ as the son of God and also believe in his Father as the Almighty God.\n“Though Jews call him Yahweh, Islam call him Allah and Christians call him Jehovah, we (Igbe) call him Owheya. “We are also conscious of the fact that religion is not defined as belief in God but the kind of life you live while on earth, hence giving room for our belief in reincarnation and a life of purity while on earth.\n“Just like the liturgy of the Catholic Church, Igbe also has its liturgy, which involves Eucharistic rites and confessions before an Uku (Priest),” 58-year-old Ejemedefe, said to have amassed several degrees in London, asserted.\nClay as prescribed\nA scholar in Urhobo culture, Mathias Orhero, who confirmed that Etarakpo’s sudden death in his prime, caused a big challenge to the group, shed light on the Igbe religion. He said as evident in the creation of man by God, Igbe adherents believe strongly in the efficacy of native chalk gotten from the earth’s crust.\nHe said: “Do not forget that according to the Bible, Jesus Christ performed series of miracles using clay and even asked some persons to go dip themselves inside a particular river seven times.\n“With devotees spread across Africa, Europe, North and South America and other parts of the world, the once unified Igbe, as founded by Etarakpo, now has over 50 sects with some of these sub-divisions no longer toeing the line of their founder having introduced the worship of mermaids, divinities and animals in the worship of God.”\nThe chief priest (Igbe Uku), Chief Omonemu, who believes in the worship of mermaids, said mermaid worship and belief in divinities do not affect his belief in Jesus Christ as the Messenger and Son of God. According to him, “Jesus Christ was sent to the earth by God for a purpose and He had since completed the task. But do not forget that there are other spiritual messengers of God.\n“One of such is what you refer to as mermaid, but we call them divinities and we commune with God through and with these divinities.”\n“On the contrary, where we differ with those you refer to as Christians is that while they await the second coming of Christ, they failed to realize that He had since come and gone when He presented Himself to Etarakpo, an apparition that gave birth to Igbe,” he said.\nPraise and worship session\nSpeaking on the spiritual implication of being an Igbe devotee, both Orhero and Omonemu said, “Igbe is a religion of purity and spiritual cleanliness. It believes that your stay here on earth is a reflection of your past life and your present life would determine your future life here on earth hence Igbe believe in reincarnation.”\nIgbe operates an unwritten liturgy. The Uku (chief priest) initiates and oversees the liturgy of the Oghwa (shrine of divinity) and administers the Orhen on worshipers for their protection and fortification as well as presiding on all rituals performed in the Oghwa.\nIn the traditional African society, virtually everybody believes that witches are extremely powerful and possess the powers to maim and kill people. The Igbe worshiper sees the religion as a counter force against the power of withes and that is where the protection presumably offered by the sect gained acceptance.\nThis reporter attended an Igbe worship session at an Uku in Agbarha-Otor, Ughelli, to comprehend the liturgy better. Akin to the Christian worship in churches, the Igbe liturgy is dramatic. Reminiscent of majority of Christians, who worship on Sundays, the holy (sacred) day of worship for Igbe is once every eight days, known as Edi-Igbe or Edi-Iruo, meaning day of dance or day of work.\nLike a practiced session, it was observed that all members of the Ogwa seems to adhere to an unwritten program of event, which is reflected in the way and manner they kneel during worship, enter into the Ogwa through a particular entrance and exit via a different direction and same applies to how you kneel.\nThe service includes dancing, praying, spiritual cleansing, confessions, intake of new members and other social/ritualistic functions.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"http://www.vanguardngr.com/2015/10/igbe-religion-torn-apart-by-worship-of-mermaids-animals-conflicting-doctrines/","2":"2069","3":"Religion","4":"2","5":"en","6":"0.9999046326"},{"0":"Barr. Mike Igini is a former Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC) in Edo and Cross River States. In this interview, he expresses shock over the judgments of the Supreme Court on the card reader and warns that the verdicts could spell doom for the nation’s electoral process.\nAs one who publicly canvassed the use of the card reader for election, what do you make of its rejection by courts?\nIt is a tragedy for Nigeria because it will reverse our democratic fortune. Any answer I give to this question will not be complete without contextualizing the need for the card reader and the consequences of the latest development. Elections in Nigeria have often times been bedeviled by efforts to ensure predetermined outcomes.\nWhereas the essence of the design of election is to make the outcome as uncertain as possible to increase the credibility of the process, due to the constant attempts by contestants/candidates and their sponsors to diminish this uncertainty by manipulating the election process, management structures and managers have undergone many reforms. For instance, between 1959 and 1999, the name of the election management agency in Nigeria has changed five times from ECN in 1959, to FEDECO in 1963, then NEC in 1986, NECON in 1993 and INEC in 1999.\nIn addition, the governing body of the institution has been reconstituted 13 times between 1958 and 2004, making it about 18 times if you add the reconstitution of the leadership since 2004 to 2015, namely Maurice Iwu, Chief Soyebi, Professor Jega, Mrs Zakari and Professor Mahmood Yakubu. Furthermore, the process has undergone many changes to voter registration, voting in the form of, hidden balloting (pre-Nwosu era), open balloting (Humphrey Nwosu period), and currently modified open balloting (post-Nwosu era).\nWe have also had modifications in the ballot papers and result sheets with customization LGA by LGA to polling units, modifications in time of delivery of materials, release of results from wide time frames to immediately after vote counting at the polling unit, collation of results, changes to collation and returning officers as well as presiding officers to graduate cadres and federal civil servants and university lecturers. We have equally had changes to duration of dispute resolution.\nIn these process changes, the introduction of the card reader was meant to reduce subjectivity and increase the fidelity of voter verification from the voter register, a previous weakness that allowed for multiple voting and inflated election results. In all of these changes, we can see that one thing has been missing. We have been modifying everything, election process, election management structure and election managers, without modifying the behaviour of participants.\nThis is the one and only remaining weak link. If the card reader and all other reforms must make sense and endure, the time has come to concentrate on modifying the behavior of election participants through the creation and institutionalization of an Electoral Offences Commission to identify, investigate and punish electoral offenders, until this is done we will continue to have controversies. The control of human behaviour is usually in two forms, normative and descriptive.\nNormative control involves voter education which INEC has been doing, cultural sanctions and ostracism, but descriptive control requires laws and statutes prescribing punishment such as prison terms, and prolonged or life ban from participation in politics. If we have been doing that, maybe our system would have weeded off many negative elements by now.\nDoubts have been cast on the legal status of the card reader for the 2015 elections and its possible future use for elections given the judgment of the Supreme Court. Can we clear these equivocations in simple clear terms for the voting public to understand what is at stake?\nFirst, nobody has shown us the provision of either the Constitution or the Electoral Act that card reader has breached, except this constant confusion over the card reader with respect to voter authentication and voting that are separate procedures; as seen in the decisions of the tribunals on many state Houses of Assembly election cases across the country that did not attract the attention of Nigerians until recent governorship matters. I have been worried since last year and l voiced my concern over the future of our elections if the card reader is not given its prime revolutionary place in our electoral system.\nMy colleagues both in the Bar and Bench involved in election petition matters should remember that the accreditation process is different from actual voting carried out at different times and should not be confused or mixed together, as it appears has happened, leading to the decisions reached by the courts most unfortunately. The act of voting begins with handing the identified/authenticated voter a ballot paper to cast a ballot. But before a person qualifies to express that choice, a presiding officer by law must first be satisfied that the voter is qualified or eligible to vote, and is in the place where he/she is duly registered as required under Section 49(1)(2) of the Act.\nIt should be noted that by virtue of the combined effect of the powers conferred on INEC under paragraph 15(a) of the Constitution to “organize, undertake, supervise and in particular Section 153 of the Act; the power to issue regulations, guidelines and manuals for the conduct of election, the Commission, in its determined efforts to strengthen the integrity of the voter register, designed and produced the permanent voter card (PVC), with a lot of security features to be used with the card reader for accreditation.\nVoter authentication and the use of the card reader, therefore, is only important for the identification or verification of only those voters who actually turned out for accreditation instead voting on behalf of people who didn’t come out to vote that is made possible with manual register alone that one can tick to justify returns. Card reader has not in any way violated any known law but rather strengthened the provision of Section 49 of the Act.\nIn effect, you are saying that the card reader’s use did not violate Section 49 of the Act now in contention?\nAbsolutely not. The card reader verification of identity helps to objectively satisfy the presiding officer to qualify the voter at the time of accreditation to be issued a ballot paper, so that he or she can cast a ballot at the time of voting. It is a condition precedent to voting as stated in Section 49 of the Electoral Act and not the actual voting as has been interpreted wrongly. Section 49 talks of the satisfaction of the presiding officer and issuing ballot to a voter to proceed and vote. But its common knowledge that accreditation usually precedes voting and all the processes regarding accreditation are contained in the guidelines and manuals.\nFrankly, in terms of legality, I don’t see where any confusion should come in. INEC introduced this process of verification because it is an operational process during an election; it doesn’t need to go back to the National Assembly to seek approval for the development of an operational process for voter identification, since the National Assembly, by the instruction of the Act, has already said the Presiding Officer should be satisfied that the voter is authentic. It is left to the election managers to devise an objective way of ensuring that satisfaction is reached with minimal equivocation using a simple device like the card reader. In fact, let me take you through stages of realizing the road goal of a free, fair and credible election because it may be easier to understand this from a policy process analysis. We have to look at it from the three types of policy, from policy formulation to implementation.\nThe Constitution and political leaders express a broad vision that, as a nation, we should conduct elections to elect people to occupy the offices created by the Constitution in Chapters 5 and 6 and the time-frame to do so and nothing more. This is a political policy statement that is generic, it does not go down to explain details of how it would be accomplished; it gives the broad goal, namely, the need to conduct elections and the body or institution like INEC charged with that responsibility.\nThe legislature then gives more specific directions in form of an executive policy on how to meet this goal, in form of an Electoral Act, that spells out how to verify the identity of a voter, creating role players in the form of a presiding officer to be responsible for this. To operationalize an executive policy, affected departments make departmental policies, through its powers to issue and use guidelines and manuals.\nThe affected department, in this case INEC, creates and circulates the guidelines, manual or codes of practice to stakeholders for comments as was done, and when all doubts and objections have been cleared, the governing body of INEC approved it for use as the Commission’s policy guiding the extant election. What law has been violated and, what is wrong with this ? I have taken time to explain these processes of policy formulation from political to executive and then departmental policy, to appreciate the legal basis of the card reader as it relates to the verification of the identity of a voter prior to offering the voter a ballot paper.\nThis hierarchy of policies is necessary to allow for flexibility in operations because the higher the order of laws, the more difficult they are to adapt to required field changes, hence greater specificity and details are required from the departmental policy makers who are the operational implementers. Historically, the identification/verification of eligible voters has been a serious operational issue that has undermined efforts to create a credible voter register.\nThe introduction of the card reader to strengthen Section 49 of the Electoral Act has helped to minimize the historical problems of massive election manipulation characterized by bogus moonlight and landslide figures that some folks want us to return to at this stage. Above all, we must not forget that the card reader was funded under the law and that is the 2013 and 2014 Appropriation Acts passed by the National Assembly. The card reader was taken to the Senate for demonstration and subsequently tested in 12 states of the federation successfully with no objection. Why now?\nBut there are those who insist that the card reader is a violation of the Electoral Act as some of your colleagues have argued in court and the recent position of the Supreme Court appears to justify their position?\nI don’t agree that the Supreme Court judgments prescribe a redundancy for the card reader. We must make that distinction because, in law, the distinction of meaning and hermeneutic clarity is very important. Although the Supreme Court explanatory notes for its judgments is yet to be released as l speak to you now, however, excepts from the Ebonyi governorship judgment delivered on February 5, clearly shows that there is a serious misunderstanding of the process as contained in section 49 and the usual accreditation process carried out separately at different times from actual voting that Section 49(2) refers to partly and here lies the misdirection about compliance with the voting process in totality as against compliance with voter identification or the accreditation process. We must not forget that in the last elections, a number of people who were accredited, some went home and never came back to vote, while others didn’t show up at all. Now, with just a manual register alone, an induced and satisfied presiding officer can tick all the names at any time as having voted, but with a card reader this is difficult if not impossible because the card reader records the time every voter was accredited on the memory and here lies the distinction between accreditation period which is different from voting time. Compliance with voter identification/verification has two options: The use of the card reader with the register and, where this is not possible for technical or other cogent and verifiable reasons, the use of an incident form and the ticking of the left hand side of the register against the voter without denying him/her. Eventually, total votes cast would always be reconciled with the incidence form. Therefore, compliance with either is compliance, provided these verifications were satisfactory to the presiding officer and they correlate with other audit trails. The audit trail which should be provable in dispute resolution should include the evidence that the affected voters did present themselves at the polling unit, were duly registered with a register of collected PVC to prove this, listing in the manual register on same date, corroborating evidence of card the reader indicating the total number of accredited voters as an audit trail report.\nWhat would be the fate of future elections, now that the Supreme Court has shut down the use of the card reader?\nNo, the apex court has not shut down the use of the card reader in our elections though that appears to be the overwhelming and very disappointing feeling of Nigerians, except something contrary and categorical in the expected reasons is stated to that effect. The confusion l see from the given reasons of the Ebonyi guber election case appears to indicate that people are mixing up the verification/accreditation process of Section 49, which is separate and ought to be separated from voting process.\nThe number of accredited voters must be ascertained, announced and recorded in the form EC8A at the close of accreditation before voting that commences at 1:30 pm and, at the end of voting, the total number of votes cast should tally with the number of accredited voters; it could be less but cannot be more, it should not be far less than total votes recorded for candidates and must not exceed total number of accredited voters or number of registered voters, otherwise, it will be canceled in accordance with Section 53 of the Act.\nThe introduction of the card reader is within the autonomy of the Commission as an independent umpire to organize and undertake the process of conducting election in Nigeria. The Electoral Act says that for a voter to be given a ballot paper to vote, the presiding officer must be satisfied that the voter is an authentic voter. In our daily life, when you present a cheque in a bank, the paying officer does not go back to the financial regulators or legislature to direct how to verify your identity as an account holders. Similarly WAEC, JAMB and so on do not require the legislature to redirect them on how to verify the identity of exam candidates.\nThese are done in the most effective manner through departmental policies in the form of operational codes or practices, guidelines and manuals. The difficulties with our people in complying with a simple method of digital verification as it affects voters is because people want to rig elections and are determined to avoid transparency in the process of identifying voters. Some of us are not fooled by the deliberate hurdle or road-block being mounted against the use of the card reader and do not expect this resistance to die without a fight.\nWe should not forget our terrible and shameful electoral history all through the first republic when we had just one frame of reference which is the manual register, and has been been used serially to declare fake and bogus figures of “moonlight” and “landslide” victory votes until the current efforts to clean up now with the use of the card reader. Today, there is an electronically compiled national register of voters with the biometric data of each voter to corroborate the number of voters in any one polling unit, which makes such ballot stuffing a joke in today’s scenario.Going forward, what we should be thinking of is how to strengthen the use of the card reader with technology and not how to make it redundant.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"http://www.vanguardngr.com/2016/02/use-of-card-reader-didnt-violate-any-law-igini/","2":"3120","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999980927"},{"0":"…arrests key suspects based in Benue, Abuja\nBy Soni Daniel\nThe Department of State Security Service has said it has busted a deadly ISIS-linked Boko Haram terrorist gang that had planned to attack the United States of America, the United Kingdom and other western interests in Nigeria.\nThe DSS in a statement by Tony Opuiyo, said it prevented the fatal attacks between the 25th and 26th March, 2017, halting the malevolent gangs based in Benue State and the FCT, from striking.\nApart from preventing the attack, the DSS said it also arrested the masterminds whose names were given Isa JIBRIL, Jibril JIBRIL, Abu Omale JIBRIL, Halidu SULE and Amhodu SALIFU.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"http://www.vanguardngr.com/2017/04/breaking-dss-foils-isis-linked-boko-haram-attack-u-s-uk-embassies/","2":"182","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9997711182"},{"0":"These 5 Global Celebrities Truly Love African Wildlife Safaris\nAfrica is full of superlatives.\nIt holds the world’s longest river and is also home to its tallest, fastest, and largest animals.

As numerous worldwide celebrities have discovered, you have to experience it in person.\nEven then, it is hard to get your fill of it, and over the years, most of these global sensations find themselves making return trips.\nSome have even established worthwhile investments, charities and foundations due to their love of Africa- the cradle of humankind.\nBelow, we look at the most prominent global icons with a penchant for African safaris and highlight what endears the continent to these A-listers.\nWe also mention some exciting things you can hope to see while on an African safari.\nOne of the landmark moments in Queen Elizabeth’s life happened while she was on safari to Kenya.\nSixty-nine years ago, the British monarch had taken a trip destined for Africa, intending to unwind from her busy schedule and sample some African wildlife.\nAccompanied by the Duke of Edinburgh, she arrived at the up-country Treetops lodge with an aerial view of an elephant’s watering hole. Bushbucks, baboons and warthogs frequent the spot, too, with the nocturnal leopard roaming at nightfall stalking its prey.\nHowever, midway through her visit, the queen received news that her ailing father, the king, had passed on. That visit, albeit cut short, marked the beginning of the queen’s reign.\nOther royals equally enamored with Kenya’s charms are Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge, Kate Middleton.\nSo much so that the Prince picked a Mount Kenya safari as the perfect opportunity for his marriage proposal to the Duchess.\nThe proposal took place at the Lewa Downs Conservancy, which holds the world’s largest population of Grevy’s Zebra. Also present are Black Rhino, lion, giraffe, elephant, and over 400 bird species.\nSir Richard Branson\nPassionate about Kenya’s wildlife Sir Richard Branson has been on several safaris.\nThe British business magnate was taken by the breathtaking beauty of the Maasai Mara savannah, its people and animals.\nKeen on promoting wildlife conservation efforts, he sunk a chunk of his investment in building the Mahali Mzuri luxury camp in the Mara to support the local community.\nThe Maasai Mara is an award-winning game reserve that hosts, among others, the annual wildebeest migration. Dubbed the eighth wonder of the modern world, that migration is the largest overland animal migration on earth.\nIt involves the movement of more than two million animals from the Serengeti in Tanzania into the greener plains of the Maasai Mara in Kenya. It is a spectacular and continuous event that occurs from July- October.\nIt is the perfect opportunity for visitors to view all manner of wildlife ranging from the Big Five, giraffe, wildebeest, jackals, hyena, cheetah, and many other animals.\nOverall, the Mara has more than 90 animal species, and trips can range from luxury safaris to budget trips.\nAt Sir Richard Branson Mahali Mzuri, game drives are normally in open safari vehicles. Mainly Toyota land cruises, land rovers, and mercedes benz. The vehicle comes with an open roof and sides to allow guest maximum game viewing and unlimited photography.\nFor Naomi Campbell, the apple of her eye is Kenya’s coastal town of Malindi and its people.\nOn her maiden visit in 1994, the British Supermodel instantly fell in love with the little seaside town nicknamed ‘little Italy.’\nThe idyllic town is a favorite among European travelers hoping to catch some sun and sand or set up holiday homes.\nNaomi herself has a majestic seaside villa and makes regular visits to Malindi every other year. Her love for Kenya saw her appointed as an international brand ambassador for Kenya’s tourism brand, Magical Kenya.\nSome of the attractions that pull visitors to Malindi include sea safaris, exquisite beaches, and many water activities.\nYou can hope to enjoy snorkeling and deep-sea diving. Big level fishing is yet another favorite, with sharks, sailfish, big marlin, and swordfish being possible catches.\nThe affordability of these trips and the ease of movement around the country make Kenya highly enticing.\nQueen of talk shows Oprah Winfrey has made several trips to Africa, particularly East and South Africa.\nHer most recent trip was to the Serengeti National Reserve in Tanzania, where she went on a hot air balloon ride across the expansive savannah.\nFeeling right at home in the African wild, Oprah went on to have a hearty breakfast right in the middle of the picturesque reserve. A couple of zebras and an assortment of other herbivores could be spotted hanging out a few feet from her in the background throughout the meal.\nFollowing her trips to South Africa, she founded the Oprah Winfrey Leadership Academy for Girls. It is a boarding school located in Meyerton, Gauteng, South Africa, to provide education and empowerment to girls in grades 8-12.\nNot even the world-renowned ‘material girl’ is immune to the allure of an African safari.\nOn one of her later visits, the queen of pop visited Kenya and was taken by the richness of culture among the country’s indigenous communities. She interacted with some Pokot and Samburu tribes and was enthralled with their way of life.\nBesides Kenya, Madonna adores Malawi, from where all four of her adopted children hail.\nSuch is her love for the country and its people that in 2017 she established a hospital christened the Mercy James hospital.

In the 50s when late Awolowo was campaigning in the north, he went with helicopters and he was mocked. People said he was flying over the houses and peeping their wives. That has continued and everywhere in the country, people say leave them alone. We don’t want any trouble. But I think the game has changed. The rules of the game have changed.\n“For every action, there will be an opposite and equal reaction. I knew that the signing of the accord was useless and that the president subjected himself to sign such an accord. For me, it was out of place for a president and commander in chief of the armed forces of a country. But the president is a humble person. He does things that even marvel some of us and make us sometimes to be very angry.\n“To be frank, I was very angry on that day they were signing it. The president has sworn to protect the lives of every Nigerian. So, why would he after taking a constitutional oath subject himself to another oath?\n“So what happened in Katsinah is not a surprise. But don’t be surprised. We are putting the world on notice that they have started first. When we reply, let no body talk. Because we are going to reply. We did not sign any accord with them. They did not sign. They are talking about about election violence now because they know that other people will respond.\n“Before, they had the monopoly of violence, so nobody cared who died. Our lives were not valuable and they had all the latitude to wreck havoc and did what they liked. But the game has changed. Be bold enough to tell them that game has changed. If they slice our throat, we are going to slice your throat. They stoned the president, you will hear from us. That’s the answer.\n“My concern is what happens after the election because we know they will do what they are known to do every time. But this time, they will cry. So all Igbo people who are there, if you don’t come back home and you want to continue to be there and something happens to you, there is nobody to be blamed. If you have a child who is a youth corper and you allow him to be there, you will not hold anybody responsible.”\nAsari who was also the former President of Ijaw Youth Council, IYC, reiterated his stand on victory for president Jonathan, saying he would win the February polls.\n“There is no way Goodluck will not win the election. We will win them and we know they are preparing for violence in consonance with some foreign powers. When they do that, we will respond disproportionately. We will respond. That’s what we are going to do. If you hit me with a stick, I am going to hit you with iron. I am not speaking in riddles. I am speaking in plain language. My English may not be very good. I am speaking in my own street language. We are going respond disproportionately and we are apologetic.\n“The people who are in Katsinah who did not hold their children should also know that I will not hold my children”, he said.\nReminded that Buhari has repeatedly dissociated himself from violence, Asari said “He is a liar. This is the same man who said that the blood of monkeys and baboons will flow on the street. He sounded a note of warning in clear terms. Who are the monkeys and the baboons? He has not explained to us. So, for him now to say whatever he says, that is his business.They burnt president Jonathan’s campaign vehicles in Jos and they were singing “sai Buhari oyoyo”. Why is it that violence is always initiated by the people shouting his name?”\nHe however said that there would not be violence unless the north “asks” for one.\n“I assure you, nothing will happen anywhere if they do not initiate violence. Did we ask them to stone the president yesterday? Do you want us to fold our arms so that they will kill him? Let them stop the violence. When they do, we will stop. A situation where Shakua will stand and say Niger Delta we are coming for you. Goodluck I am coming for you. You are a man and I am a man. We are going to look at each other eyeball to eyeball. You can shoot and I can shot. You can kill and I can kill. You can destroy and I can destroy.\n“The question is not for me. It is for Buhari, el-Rufai, Shakua. They are the people you have to direct this question to. Go and ask Buhari why he allowed his people to stone the president and commander -in-chief in Katsinah. There must be balance of terror. One person does not have the prerogative to kill, main and destroy.\nOn the preparedness and readiness of the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC to conduct the polls, Asari said INEC was not ready. He however did not support the idea of postponing the elections\n“From what INEC has done so far, it is not because of the violence, so many people have not collected their PVC. Look at the “ojoro”that is going on in INEC. Twenty of the twenty seven local governments in Borno are in the hands of Boko haram but more people have collected PVCs in Borno than in Abia state where there is no crisis.\n“For me, let every person be allowed to vote without PVC. If we are going to use the PVC, then INEC is not ready. But I am not calling for the postponement of the election. We will win the election decisively. On the 14th of February, there will be “failbuhari” and will win decisively.”\nOn the saga trailing the academic qualification of Buhari, the Niger Delta activist challenged the presidential candidate to produce his WAEC certificate.\n“A man rose to the rank of a General in the Nigeria army with a note from a principal that this man is in Form six, he will pass English, Mathematics, etcetera, he should be recruited and commissioned into the army. A year after this Mr. Saint deposited an affidavit that he has a WAEC result which has not been found. He said the military board has my result. Where on earth do you give your original certificate to your employers?” He asked.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"http://www.vanguardngr.com/2015/01/katsina-stoning-niger-delta-ll-retaliate-says-dokubo-asari/","2":"1612","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999904633"},{"0":"President Muhammadu Buhari\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has said that his government cannot afford to pay forty-two ministers and that not all ministerial nominees screened by the Senate will have portfolios.\nThe President also said that Nigeria has been ‘material and morally vandalized’ and that he will reduce the numbers of ministries.\nBuhari in an interview with Channels TV and Nigerian Television Authority, NTA, in New Delhi in India said that he is working with people introduced to him by others that he trust and must work with them.\nBuhari while reacting to a question on the divide in the National Assembly over Rotimi Amaechi’s confirmation as minister said he did not work into the presidency alone hence he can not work alone and that some of those having problems at the National Assembly he had never met them.\n‘This is team work, I said I know some people but there are others, I accepted from other people that I trust without even knowing them.’\n‘May be those that are having problems in the National Assembly I doubt if I have met them in my life but then, I am working with others.’\n‘I did not work into the presidency alone.

I see it in the papers, watch it on screen but I have never lost a sleep on it because those that are not corrupt should even encourage us to do more.

At the same time, regular sex gives you and your partner the physical, mental and emotional boost.\nBut before practising everyday sex or sexual activities, remember that consent is a paramount prerequisite and to attain consent you need to ask your partner about it and how they like you to approach the whole process.\nSome partner like long foreplay before sex because it gives them pleasure or brings them into the mood, others may just want a spontaneous or quickie and some like both in no particular order.\nAlthough, sex is quite crucial and one of the toughest things to discuss with a partner especially if what you want to discuss involves them changing their bedroom behaviour.\nMeanwhile, regular discussions about sex help partners to build a happy relationship, while having sex regularly helps to build a healthy relationship by bringing couples closer to each other’s desires, preferences and ensure you are both getting the ultimate satisfaction.\nWhy You Should Be Having Sex Every Day\nDid you know having sex everyday could give you the boost that you need? Now you know, so regardless of your gender, you should be having sex regularly. Here are 10 healthy reasons why you should have sex every day with your partner.\nDaily sex does wonders for your heart and reduces risks of heart-related diseases such as stroke and blood pressure. During sexual activity, you tend to breathe intensely, this singular act works as a form of respiratory exercise and makes your heart function better.\nLots of studies have proven that regular sex can ward off heart attacks, therefore, the more you have sex the more you see your heart getting better and stronger. According to a study carried out by Queen’s University Belfast revealed that having sex three times a week could halve your risk of having a heart attack or stroke.\nAnother study in Israel found that women who had two orgasms a week are less likely to have heart disease than those who did not enjoy sex or didn’t have an orgasm. At the same time, men who have sex more than twice a week, have a lesser risk of getting a heart attack, than men who do it just once a month.\nBoost Immune System And Longevity\nRegular sex is an automatic immune booster, the more you have sex the more your body produces chemicals, hormones and antibodies which released antigen such as immunoglobulin A (IgA) that is responsible for strengthening the immune system.\nResearch carried out at Wilkes University in Pennsylvania found that participants who had sex once or twice a week had 30% higher levels of IgA than those who had sex less frequently. So feeling down or cold? Have a round of hot sex.\nEveryday sex increases the level of the immune-boosting antibody which in turn makes your body stronger against illnesses like the common cold and fever. When you have an orgasm, a hormone called dehydroepiandrosterone is released.\nThis improves immunity, repairs tissue and keeps the skin healthy. Men, who have at least two orgasms a week, live longer than men who have sex just once every few weeks.\nIt Aid Good Sleep\nThere are a couple of hormones responsible for getting good sleep and they include melatonin, serotonin, endorphins and oxytocin, all of these can be achieved through regular sex\nNaturally, everyday sex makes your body release happy hormones that boost your intimacy and urge for doing the act repeatedly. These sex hormones aid better sleep. Seratonin helps to make you feel calm and relaxed and the body produces this chemical in the brain as a pleasure response, and it is released during orgasm/ejaculation.\nMelatonin on the other hand helps to produce hormones that regulate sleep and maintain the circadian rhythm of the body. An increased serotonin level may also lead to an increase in melatonin level, which further induces sleep.\nWhile, Oxytocin, also known as the love hormone, can help you get some shut-eye as well. That happy-lovey-dovey feeling you get during or after sex is the result of oxytocin coursing through your bloodstream. It helps to reduce stress, lowers blood pressure, and makes it easier for you to fall asleep.\nHaven't you noticed that the sleep you get immediately after you have sex is much more relaxed and makes you feel alert when you wake? Getting a good night’s sleep works on your overall health, so have more sex regularly.\nKeeps You Looking Younger\nSex has been proven to keep your skin looking younger for longer without using wrinkle cream or botox injections. The morning glow and the shinny body is the product of your regular sex.\nHence, if you keep having dry skin or body irritation consider having sex with your partner every day, the more you do it, the more your skin gets repaired and you will develop a healthy relationship as a bonus.\nSpice up your bedroom atmosphere and add glow to your skin by saying yes to daily sex.\nRegular Sex Reduce Pain\nHaving a severe headache, acute pain or suffering from menstrual torture? Sex can help you get rid of all of these, having sex during your period has been proven to ease the pain because when you are about to have an orgasm the level of oxytocin and endorphin hormones produced increases by five times and helps you reduce aches and pains.\nTrust me, it is more fun than using pain relief drugs, although it could be an uncomfortable feeling to have sex during your menstruation, it really helps and there are fewer risks of getting pregnant during this period. All you need to do is to wash out the blood thoroughly before engaging in the act to avoid any form of irritation.\n“Orgasms can block pain. We have found that vaginal stimulation can block chronic back and leg pain and many women have stated that genital self-stimulation can reduce menstrual cramps, arthritic pain, and in some cases even headache,” according to the neuroscience behind orgasms and pain response carried out by Dr Barry Komisaruk of Rutgers University.\nBuilds Emotional Intimacy\nRegular sex helps both partners to strengthen their emotional bond and intimacy. Remember, copulating is not merely about physical intimacy and reproduction purpose alone, my dear sex goes beyond that.\nFor any relationship to be successful, it is important that the people involved are emotionally on the same page and having sex is a great way to build that emotional intimacy.\nIf you are trying to achieve pregnancy or you want your offspring to look fresh and beautiful, you need to keep your sperm fresh in tip-top shape by having sex at least twice a week, not only during her ovulation but steadily.\nThis may sound odd or bizarre to your hear, but that is the truth, studies have proven that the more often you make love, the better quality your sperm will be.\nSemen health was found to be best when sex had last occurred less than two days before the sperm was tested and was greatly decreased after 10 days of abstinence. Regular sex has also been found to help balance a woman’s hormones and regulate her periods, which can further boost the chances of conceiving.\nLowers Risk Of Prostate Cancer\nA state study from Harvard Medical School shows that men who ejaculated more often automatically reduced their risk of having prostate cancer by 22 per cent than men who don't.\nResearchers at Nottingham University have also found out that men who enjoy a regular sex life in their 50s are at lower risk of developing prostate cancer. This is because sex clears the prostate of toxins that could otherwise linger and trigger cancerous changes.\nThe link was first suggested after several studies showed that monks appeared to have a higher chance of developing prostate cancer.\nBuild Mental Stability\nMental stability is another healthy way partners have to regularly engage in sexual activity since research has shown that having sex every day or regularly can restore all your mental health, renew your positive thoughts and strengthen your mind to accommodate innovations and ideas.\nWhen stressed, tired or not feeling right about yourself, regular sex can easily heal you, cuddling alone can help you release Oxytocin and dopamine hormones which will melt all your stress away instantly.\nDaily sex reduces stress by increasing endorphins-hormones that are responsible for boosting sex moods. Don’t forget that sex is a form of exercise that is responsible for reducing stress and keeping you calm. Every time you are under stress, just make love with your partner, it is the fastest yet healthiest way to beat stress.\nLastly, sex helps to enhance physical and mental improvement, sex is known to be one of the best ways to build your muscle, doing workout and exercise because copulating strengthens your cardiovascular system, from your back, leg to your hip as well.\nSo, If you find going to the gym awkward or working out at home a task, here is another healthy way to help you lose weight and keep you in shape. Half an hour of lovemaking has been proven to burns more than 80 per cent calories, consequentially, sex will do wonders for your waistline.","1":"https://allnews.ng/news/why-you-should-be-having-sex-every-day-amazing-health-benefits","2":"1911","3":"Romance","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999885559"},{"0":"Ortom denies making hate speech against Buhari\nThe Benue State Governor Samuel Ortom yesterday denied claims that he accused President Muhammadu Buhari of attempting to Islamise the country.\nThe governor said he does not indulge in hate speech against the President under whatever guise.\nHe also said throughout last year, the state was able to pay workers’ salaries.\nOrtom made the clarifications in a statement by his Special Adviser (SA) on Media and ICT, Tahav Agerzua, following alleged hate speech levelled against him by the Presidency.\nThe statement said: “Our attention has been drawn to a statement credited to Garba Shehu, the Senior Special Assistant (SSA) to the President on Media and Publicity, that Governor Ortom should desist from hate speeches against President Muhammadu Buhari.\n“It is on record that Governor Ortom has never stated anywhere that President Buhari plans to Islamise the country.\n“He prays daily for the President for God to grant him good health and wisdom and commends him for upgrading Exercise Ayem Akpatuma to Operation Whirl Stroke, which has been able to reduce herdsmen attacks in Benue State to the barest minimum.\n“It could be recalled that Governor Ortom was one of those who organised prayers and fasting for the President when he had protracted health challenges in 2017.”\nThe governor said he had never blamed the President personally for the farmers-herders crises of 2018 in the state.\nHe said he had always reported the activities of Miyetti Allah Kautal Hore to the Presidency and security agencies though no action was taken.\nOrtom said the Presidency had never supported the state’s Open Grazing Prohibition and Ranches Establishment Law 2017.\nHe said: “On January 13, 2018, the Fulani Nationality Movement (FUNAM), met in Kano and issued a statement that what was happening in Benue State was a continuation of the 1804 Jihad when recalcitrant Benue indigenes stopped them in their quest to dip the Qur’an in the sea.\n“They stated that they were currently equipped with weapons and political power to continue with the agenda.\n“This was also reported to the Presidency and the security agencies but nothing was done. It must have been the guilty conscience arising from the failure to forestall these attacks and their enormous deadly consequences that may have prompted the Presidency to issue today’s mischievous statement.\n“More so that in the aftermath of the attacks President Buhari did not offer any message of sympathy or condolence to the bereaved families and the people of the state.\n“The best that came from him when major stakeholders from the state visited him in Abuja and after a long expected visit to the state was that Benue people should learn to live with and accommodate their neighbours.\n“In all these, Governor Ortom does not hold the President responsible. The well-known cabal in his administration might be responsible for his ignorance of the real situation on ground.\nTop notchers of his administration have blamed the Benue law for sparking the farmers’/herders’ crises in Benue State without explaining what is responsible for the crises in other states, including Zamfara, Adamawa, Plateau, Kaduna, Kogi, Ebonyi, Oyo, Ogun, and several others where there is no such law.\n“Others say the blocking of grazing reserves and cattle routes is a justification for the conquest and occupation agenda.\n“The Presidency at a time issued a statement that it was better to give up land and be alive than to hold on to it and die.\n“Meanwhile, the Presidency may also not be aware of the Miyetti Allah and its supporters’ agenda in Benue State, which includes the perpetration of impunity with the connivance of the police and other security agencies.\n“This explains the constant transfers of police commissioners in Benue State as a search for those who will dance to the whims and caprices of All Progressives Congress (APC) leaders in the state.\n“The Presidency has never come out openly to express support for the Open Grazing Prohibition and Ranches Establishment Law 2017.”","1":"http://thenationonlineng.net/ortom-denies-making-hate-speech-buhari/","2":"896","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999923706"},{"0":"By LAWANI MIKAIRU\nAn Emirates flight EK 262 from Sao Paulo, Brazil to Dubai, United Arab Emirates was Saturday forced to make an emergency landing in Lagos due to the deteriorating health condition of a passengers believed to have ingested cocaine.\nAfter screening by anti-narcotic officials four other passengers are currently under interrogation after testing positive to drug ingestion.\nOne of the suspects was immediately hospitalised as doctors battle to save his life.\nChairman/Chief Executive of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA), Col.

In the interest of society they need to die under the law. The rule of law is different from resolutions by some NGOs and nations are not governed by NGO resolutions.\n“As a governor, I subscribed to an oath of office which says that I shall obey the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, including all laws without fear or favour. I cannot be afraid to sign the death warrant of a man who has been found guilty of murder.\n“I have no apologies, I didn’t sentence them to death. I am not the one who accused them, they were accused by those they harassed. They have been tried, they have taken advantage of the appellate courts all the way to the Supreme Court of the land and they were found guilty. The law also says that having been found guilty and sentenced to death, the governor could exercise prerogative of mercy, but I say that I have no mercy on those who kill. Why should you compel me to have mercy on those who kill?”\n“We must have a balanced view of human rights in which the rights, not only of the man they killed, but the right of his relations and much more importantly, to send a clear message to would be murderers, that when you kill a human being and you are caught, you are likely to die. If you don’t want to die, then abstain from killing. If criminals abstain from killing, fewer people would be killed by robbers and other murderers and that is the truth.\n“If you tell me that the man killed and has a right to life, I refuse that. Amnesty should not be hypocritical about it, we have the records worldwide. Nations are governed by their national values and it is debatable whether those who excuse murderers in the eyes of God whether they are better human beings than those who insist that ‘if you kill that you too should be killed if found guilty of killing’.\n“The second person was a man who killed a woman. He robbed the woman, raped the woman and killed her. And then he was found guilty of this offence by the Supreme Court of Nigeria and you tell me, though he has killed, let him live. I say no. If he has killed, let him die too. I am not the one who says he should die, it is the law.\nAll I have done is that the law says I should sign and I have obeyed the law by signing because even the government is under the law.”\nGovernor Oshiomhole, however, said that he had in the recent past also exercised the prerogative of mercy on some other convicts who did not kill in the course of their activities.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"http://www.vanguardngr.com/2012/11/death-row-convicts-must-die-oshiomhole/","2":"882","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999961853"},{"0":"Abeokuta – Gov.

Division of the Court of Appeal, applied for the withdrawal of the Certificate of Return that was issued to Tinubu by the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC.\nHe maintained that the declaration of Tinubu as the winner of the presidential election was “invalid by reason of non-compliance with the provisions of the Electoral Act, 2022”.\nAtiku, through his team of lawyers led by Mr Joe Kyari Gadzama, SAN, further argued that Tinubu’s election was invalid by reason of corrupt practices.\n“The 2nd Respondent was not duly elected by a majority of lawful votes cast at the

election, alleging that he was previously convicted and fined the sum of $460,000.00 by the United States District Court, Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division, in Case No: 93C 4483, for an offence involving dishonesty and drug trafficking.\nObi prayed the court to declare him as the candidate that secured the majority of the lawful votes cast with the required constitutional spread of not less than 25% of the votes cast in at least 2/3 of the States of the Federation, and the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja.\nIn the alternative, he prayed the court to order a fresh poll, with the exclusion of both Tinubu and the APC, by virtue of their non qualification to participate in the election.\nIt will be recalled that INEC had on March 1, announced Tinubu as the winner of the presidential poll, ahead of 17 other candidates that contested the election.\nIt declared that Tinubu scored a total of 8,794,726 votes to defeat Atiku who polled a total of 6,984,520 votes and Obi

the progress of the Federal Government’s Amnesty programme described the development as disturbing as some of them could no longer move freely for fear of the being attacked.\nThe ex militant leaders who also agreed to stop deduction from the monthly allowance of their boys however called on the Amnesty Committee to look into their welfare as they (leaders) cannot be collecting the same amount with their boys.\nGen Pastor Rueben who led twelve other ex militant leaders drawn from Bayelsa, Delta and Edo State while commending late President Musa Yar’Adua for initiating the Amnesty programme which brought about the relative calm in the once troubled region lamented that some of the promises made to them had not been fulfilled.\nPastor Reuben who once controlled a camp on the Akassa fringe of the Atlantic Ocean lamented that in the last one year four of their senior colleagues had been killed by unknown persons after voluntarily accepting the federal government amnesty.\nOn the contentious deduction of the monthly allowance of the boys, he said though the money was used in taking care of some of the needs of their boys, the leaders of the Peace Keeping Ex Militants Forum made of thirteen former camps had unanimously agreed to stop the deduction forthwith.\nHis words, “It is long since we accept the amnesty and since then nothing had been for any of the leaders which necessitated the deduction from our boys allowance but today we have agreed that the deduction should stop. Unknown to many, it is from the same deducted amount that we use in meeting some of their needs.”\nThe ex militant leaders who pleaded with the federal government through the amnesty committee to see to their welfare since they are receiving the same amount with their boys threatened to stage a peaceful protest to Abuja to register their grievances such as fear of being attack and killed as well as the improvement of their welfare package.\nThey used the opportunity to endorsed the retention of the Petroleum Minister, Mrs. Diezani Allison-Madueke by President Goodluck Jonathan saying the minister had performed creditably in ensuring that petroleum products gets to all the nooks and crannies of the country including the creeks of the delta.\nAlso the National Deputy President of the Ijaw Youth Council worldwide, Comrade Preye Agama who spoke at the forum lauded the ex militant leaders over their peaceful conduct and urged the federal government through the amnesty committee office to look into their demands.\n“President Goodluck Jonathan” he said “was part of the negotiation team at the conception of the amnesty deal for Niger Delta militants to surrender their arms and is in a better position to meet their demands and that of the entire Niger Delta.”\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"http://www.vanguardngr.com/2011/05/ex-militant-leaders-threaten-to-disrupt-inauguration-over-alleged-insecurity-of-members/","2":"676","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999580383"},{"0":"Verdict on Osun governorship poll cannot stand, says Aregbesola\nFormer Osun State Governor Rauf Aregbesola has described the judgment of the Election Petition Tribunal last Friday, which nullified the election of Governor Gboyega Oyetola as very strange and unknown to law.\nAregbesola, in a statement by his Media Adviser, Mr. Sola Fasure, said the report of the split judgment came to every watcher of political events in the state as a rude shock.\nIn the statement entitled: “This judgment cannot stand,” the former governor said the people of the state and the government have the highest regards for the judiciary and would keep having high regards for the revered institution.\nAregbesola, however, regretted that the tribunal’s majority judgment was strange to law and common sense.\nHe said the majority judgment, as delivered by their Lordship, did not support the cause of electoral justice and might constitute the death knell for properly conducted elections.\nAregbesola said the people rejected the majority judgment and believe that it would not stand scrutiny at the appellate court.\nThe statement noted that the majority judgment, which held that the rerun election conducted in seven polling units on the September 27, 2018, was illegal, null and void, was equally shocking and amounts to a travesty of justice.\nHe said the government would appeal the judgment, adding that the verdict would be upturned.\nThe former governor wondered why elections in 17 polling would be annulled when there was no evidence of any act known to render them null and void in an election petition such as over-voting, non-accreditation, ballot box stuffing among others.\nAregbesola contended that concern for substantive justice should have dictated that since the results from the 17 units were duly signed and adjudged by INEC to be authentic, there should not have been any controversy over there validity.\nHe lamented that the tribunal has effectively disenfranchised the legitimate voters in the 17 polling units and rendered the election undemocratic.\nThe statement said: “In nullifying the elections in the 17 polling units, the majority judgment predicated it on what is regarded as ‘substantial non-compliance’ with the provisions of the Electoral Act 2010. The said non-compliance, according to the judgment, borders on the failure of INEC’s appointed presiding officers to record accreditation and ballot accounting on the result forms in the 17 polling units.\n“There was no evidence of any act known to render election null and void in an election petition such as over voting, non-accreditation, ballot box stuffing etc.\n“This much was highlighted in the dissenting judgment of the Chairman of the Tribunal in disagreeing with the majority decision.\n“It must be noted that APC and its candidate were not accused of any electoral malfeasance in the 17 polling units. Rather, INEC, a common agent of PDP and APC (and indeed, all the political parties), which neither of the parties has control over was merely accused of not complying with its manual for the election, when the presiding officers appointed for the election failed to make the entries.\n“Therefore, the most relevant question one would pose here is: should the tribunal allow APC to suffer as a result of the mistakes or omissions occasioned by the INEC staff? Certainly, no!”\nThe statement added: “Equally shocking are the reasons advanced by the two justices. They advanced the proposition that elections in the seven polling units were cancelled by the state collation officer. This was not the case. There were no elections in the seven polling units, and if there was any, the onus was on the petitioners. This onus was not discharged in anyway as no results was tendered.\n“The state collation officer in compliance with the margin of lead principle rightly reasoned that the outcomes of the elections could not be determined without conducting polls in the affected elections. Hence the commission’s decision to conduct supplementary elections in line with these principles.”\nThe ex-governor urged APC members, “supporters and lovers of justice, who have been outraged by this verdict, to be calm and unruffled”.\nHe insisted that the verdict cannot stand.\n“As they say in law, you cannot build something on nothing,”Aregbesola said.\nYouths protest panel’s judgment as Oyetola preaches peace\nA Group of youths under the Osun Concerned Citizens yesterday protested judgment of the Osun Election Petitions Tribunal on the September 22, 2018 state governorship poll.\nLast Friday, a three-man tribunal ruled that the People’s Democratic Party’s governorship candidate, Senator Ademola Adeleke, was the winner of the poll.\nDuring the peaceful protest, the youths, in their hundreds, marched round major streets of Osogbo, the state capital, from Ayetoro junction via Old Garage and Okefia to Olaiya area.\nThe youths, who carried placards with various inscriptions like “Oyetola remain our governor”, “We voted for Governor Oyetola”, “We cannot be intimidated” among others, caused a traffic gridlock for many hours.\nAddressing the crowd, the group’s General Secretary, Comrade Yaya Ademola, said the protest was aimed at sensitising the people about issues associated with the governorship election.\nAdemola, who noted the lacuna in the tribunal’s ruling, was optimistic that the Court of Appeal would overturn the tribunal judgment.\nHe said any attempt to distort the majority votes would be resisted.\nBut, Governor Gboyega Oyetola, while addressing the protesters, urged the people to keep the peace as they await the final judicial pronouncement on the governorship election.\nHe said the people, while expressing their views on the tribunal judgment, should exercise caution, adding that he believes in the judicial process.\nA statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr. Adeniyi Adesina, quoted the governor as saying: “I believe that the judicial process should be allowed to take its course. I have hope that we shall be vindicated and our mandate, which the people freely gave us, will be reaffirmed.\n“Let us all be law-abiding as we keep hope alive.”","1":"http://thenationonlineng.net/verdict-on-osun-governorship-poll-cannot-stand-says-aregbesola/amp/?__twitter_impression=true","2":"1343","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999866486"},{"0":"2023: Why Nigerians should support Tinubu, by lawmaker\nBy Emmanuel Oladesu, Deputy Editor\nHouse of Representatives member Akeem Adeyemi on Tuesday urged Nigerians to support the All Progressives Congress (APC) National Leader, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, if he decides to run for President in 2023.\nThe party chieftain, who represents Oyo East, West and Afijo Constituency, described the former Lagos State governor as a political phenomenon, an astute administrator and shrewd businessman who has within the span of 23 years become the “Generalisimo of Nigerian politics”.\nAdeyemi, a prince of Oyo Kingdom, described Tinubu as a tactician who has the antecedent of being a pro-democracy crusader, a bridge builder, risk taker, humanist and a man of foresight.\nThe former council chairman also noted that Asiwaju Tinubu is a reference point in the political class, judging by his refusal to collapse his political structure into the then ruling Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).\nPaying tribute to Asiwaju Tinubu’s resilience and capacity for survival, the lawmaker said the former governor withstood the antics and manipulative tendencies of former Presudent Olusegun Obasanjo, who tried to cripple Lagos State by withholding allocations to the newly created councils.\nAdeyemi said Tinubu adorned the cap of creativity, deployed new strategies for internally-generated revenue to pay workers’ salaries and funded many developmental projects.\nHailing him as a staunch opposition leader, Adeyemi said the APC leader never wavered in his constructive criticism of the PDP-led administration for 16 years.\nGoing down memory lane, Adeyemi said Tinubu’s achievements have strategically placed him on a high pedestal of national politics.\nHe paid tribute to him for his frontline role in the formation of the defunct Action Congress (AC), its transformation into the Action Congress of Nigeria (ACN), and the fusion of the legacy parties into the APC.\nNoting that Tinubu has never held party positions, despite his efforts, the lawmaker said he has remained an embodiment of loyalty and commitment to party causes.\nAdeyemi added: “His strategic political roadmap of aligning the West with the North was key to APC’s victory in the 2015 general elections.\n“Against all odds, he ensured the emergence of his preferred candidate, Muhammadu Buhari, as the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress.”\nThe Oyo prince also described Tinubu as a hunter for talents and a leader keen on nurturing young people for leadership.\nHe recalled that the former governor was instrumental to the rise of prominent leaders, including Vice- President Yemi Osinbajo (SAN), House of Representatives Speaker Femi Gbajabiamila, former Lagos State Governor Babatunde Fashola, former Osun State Governor Rauf Aregbesola, Ekiti State Governor Kayode Fayemi, Information Minister Lai Mohammed and Senator Ibikunle Amosun.\nOther included Governors Gboyega Oyetola (Osun), Dapo Abiodun (Ogun), Babajide Sanwo-Olu (Lagos), Rotimi Akeredolu (Ondo) and AbdurRahman Abdur-Razak (Kwara), as well as former Governors Akinwumi Ambode (Lagos), Adeniyi Adebayo (Ekiti), Mrs. Abike Dabiri-Erewa, Mrs. Adejoke Orelope-Adefulire, Babatunde Fowler, Ben Akabueze, Joe Igbokwe, Mr. Supo Shasore, Femi Pedro and Senator Musiliu Obanikoro.","1":"https://thenationonlineng.net/2023-why-nigerians-should-support-tinubu-by-lawmaker/","2":"814","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9994155765"},{"0":"By Babajide Komolafe\nLAGOS— The Nigerian economy is out of recession and growing strong, says United Kingdom-based World Economics.\nThe organisation, which is dedicated to producing analysis, insight and data relating to questions of importance in understanding the world economy, said this development was reflected in the growth of its April Sales Managers’ Index, SMI, for Nigeria, which rose to 58.5 per cent from 56.7 per cent in March.\nAccording to a report on its website, the organisation said: “April Sales Managers’ Index, SMI, data suggests that the Nigerian economy is continuing to grow out of the recession which saw 10 months of consecutive contraction in 2016.\n“The Market Growth Index grew to 58.5 in April as the monthly Sales Growth Index ticked up to 56.7, its highest value since 2015 and representative of rapid growth.

But the real one sits here,” she said, adding the world is “safer” with Masterson in jail.\nIt was the second rape trial for 47-year-old Masterson, after previous proceedings were declared a mistrial in November when a different jury was unable to reach a unanimous decision.\nThe jury in the retrial deadlocked on another rape charge against a third woman. That charge was dismissed.\nMasterson has been in custody awaiting sentencing since his conviction.\nThe actor rose to fame with the 1998 launch of retro sitcom “That ’70s Show,” where he played the character of Steven Hyde alongside fellow stars Mila Kunis and Ashton Kutcher.\nHe co-starred again with Kutcher on Netflix’s “The Ranch,” but was fired in 2017 and written off the show after Los Angeles police confirmed they were investigating multiple rape allegations against the actor.\nThe three women at the heart of the charges against Masterson were members of the Church of Scientology at the time. Two of them said church officials had discouraged them from contacting law enforcement.\nMasterson’s lawyers in closing arguments questioned why the court had heard “so much about Scientology,” and the defense had suggested that bias against the church could have been a motivating factor.\nThe Church of Scientology criticized the notion that it had tried to silence the complaints.\n“The church has no policy prohibiting or discouraging members from reporting criminal conduct of anyone, Scientologists or not, to law enforcement,” a statement said.\n“Quite the opposite, church policy explicitly demands Scientologists abide by all laws of the land.”\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"http://www.vanguardngr.com/2016/04/fg-defends-amaechi-says-project-captured-in-budget/That","2":"742","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.999956131"},{"0":"A prominent member of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP has described ‘October 1st’ under President Muhammadu Buhari’s led government as the worst ever in the history of independence day celebrations in the country.\nAdeyanju’s statement reads: The is typically a day of celebration for Nigeria and Nigerians. It signifies the day Nigeria achieved independence from colonial rule and began the journey towards nationhood.\nIn the past, October 1st was a day celebrated with pomp and pageantry as Nigerians savoured the taste of liberty. In the past, October 1st was a day Nigerians put aside whatever challenges faced us as a nation and, together, shared the very essence of being Nigerian.\nHowever, October 1st 2016 is not a day of celebration. It is not a day of pomp nor is it a day to bask in the euphoria of a fulfilled nation. It is a day to spend in deep reflection about the worrying socio-political and economic state of our nation.\nAt the inception of the President Muhammadu Buhari administration on May 29th, 2016 many expected that he would move quickly to heal a nation sharply divided by the election season, and take urgent steps to maintain the Nigerian economy on a path of economic growth.\nIndeed, the statement in his inaugural speech about belonging to everybody and belonging to nobody gave credence to this hope.\nAlas, President Buhari has furthered those divides by his words and conduct. It is common knowledge that Nigeria is at its most fractured state, along ethnic and religious lines, perhaps since the Civil War. President Buhari has by his words, actions and inactions constantly stoked the fires of sectarian tensions creating an atmosphere of distrust and strife.\nThis administration has failed Nigerians on so many other fronts in 2016 such that millions of Nigerians simply do not feel Independence Day is worth celebrating.\nFor instance, its human rights record is appalling. Despite an international outcry, the government has failed to prosecute a single person for the mass murder of over 1,000 Shiite Muslims by the military in December 2015.\nTheir leader has been detained since December 2015 along with his wife without charge despite both of them suffering severe injuries during the attack.\nThe military has gone on to summarily execute 100s of members of IPOB without recourse to the rule of law. Opponents of the ruling party, including journalists and online bloggers/social commentators, have been arrested and detained for varying periods without charge or in violation of valid court orders.\nThe greatest freedoms we achieved as a nation by being free is the freedom of association, worship, speech and even freedom after speech which had become more visible from 1999-2016 under the PDP years are freedoms that is now threatened by the tyrannic nature of this regime. At 56, Nigerians now live in fear of expression.\nOn the economic front, the incoherent policies of the Buhari administration have led us into the worst economic crises in 29 years. Consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth confirm that the country is officially in a recession yet no one can point to a coherent, cogent plan to overcome this situation.\nAn unprecedented 4.58million people have lost their jobs since the inception of this administration, the prices of food have risen astronomically to the point where people can no longer afford food and resort to stealing pots of food from the fire, inflation has hit 17.5% which has in the process caused prices of other goods & services to go through the roof and so on.\nThe absolutely shambolic monetary policies of this administration have ensured that the Naira is thus far the worst performing currency globally after the Vietnamese Bolivar and the Suriname Dollar.\nAs the time of writing this, the exchange rate is $1 – N490, £1 – N600 and €1 – N520.\nWhile we can appreciate sustained progress in the fight against boko haram, that war is not yet over. Only 3 days ago, BBC reported the capture of several towns by the terrorist group and the hoisting of their flags in those areas.\nIn the North Central region of Nigeria, and parts of Kaduna, the menace of herdsmen has gone on unchecked. It is on record that herdsmen have killed more than 1000 people in 2016 alone, making them the fourth most deadly terrorist group in the world. This administration has barely even acknowledged this ongoing genocide against the peoples of North Central Nigeria.\nKidnappings have become brazen and frequent, cultism is rising unchecked in parts of the country and so on. At the time of writing this, reports had just broken out about the kidnap of the wife of the CBN governor.\nAll these indices, paint a picture of the grim reality into which the Buhari administration has forced on Nigeria. These facts paint a picture of the reasons why Nigerians find it difficult to celebrate on Independence Day.\nPerhaps most painful part of the current socio-political and economic reality that has Nigeria suffers on her 56 birthday is that in the midst of all this – 17% inflation, -2% GDP growth, more than 4millions jobs lost; President Buhari yesterday launched his own photo-book at the State House, Aso Rock.\nOne is hard pressed to escape the conclusion that President Buhari is more concerned about his image than the severe havoc his policies are wrecking on the nation.\nAnother thing that threatens our progress as a nation is the reversing of all electoral gains we have made from 1999-2015. Elections are now either inconclusive or outrightly rigged as it was in the case of #EdoDecides where fake results was announced by INEC and the APC candidate Godwin Obaseki declared as winner.\nBut in all this, we must celebrate the indomitable Nigerian spirit. We must celebrate our ability to preserve in spite of damning odds. We must celebrate our ability to thrive in spite of the government’s determination to be a stumbling block in our path. We must celebrate because as Nigerians, we share a collective ability to bend but not break in the face of horrible circumstances.\nSo even while we take time to reflect on the horrible circumstances in which we are being forced to live, we must take time to celebrate the knowledge that because we are Nigerians – WE SHALL OVERCOME.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"http://www.vanguardngr.com/2016/10/oct-1st-2016-worst-independence-day-since-1960-adeyanju/","2":"1313","3":"Politics","4":"2","5":"en","6":"0.9999904633"},{"0":"Ogun State Waste Management Authority, OGWAMA has sealed two Chinese companies for operating in dirty environments, with improper waste disposal.\nThe companies are Yibao Industrial Limited, Bara Village along the Sagamu – Abeokuta Expressway and Ronchang Industrial Park, opposite Julius Berger yard Lagos -Ibadan Expressway.\nSpecial Adviser and Managing Director of OGWAMA, Abayomi Hunye who led the enforcement team said the action followed several warnings which were not heeded.\nHunye explained that the two companies were also found guilty of engaging the services of unaccredited waste collectors to evacuate their waste in contravention of section 17 of the Ogun State Waste Management Authority Law of 2020 as well as their continued prevention of the assigned waste collectors to evacuate their waste from their facilities since 2021.\nHe noted that their unaccredited waste collectors who operate at odd hours were also found guilty of dumping waste on the Sagamu – Abeokuta and Lagos – Ibadan Expressways illegally.\nHunye said, “The essence of shutting them down is to ensure that they comply with the standard ways of managing wastes in the state.

He is the director of London-based Radio Biafra which, for some years now, has been disseminating news and information about Igboland and the degraded status of its people in the Fulani caliphate colonialist “geographical expression” called Nigeria. Now, the main thrust of the message from Radio Biafra is resurrection of the defunct sovereign state of Biafra through non-violent means. Drawing copiously from Nigerian history, Kanu and hardcore IPOB members believe that Biafra comprises all Igbo-speaking areas of Nigeria as well as adjoining territories that have strong historical and cultural ties with Igboland. Kanu has always stated publicly his unflinching commitment to the restoration of Biafra, that is, to the quest for self-determination by Ndigbo and their immediate neighbours because, according to him, Nigeria is an illegitimate child of imperialist Britain that was born for maximum exploitation of the colonial amalgam created by Lord Lugard in 1914. To worsen matters, successive colonial administrators deliberately configured Nigeria geopolitically to favour the north, such that even before complete results of the 1959 federal election were collated and announced, Sir James Robertson had already contacted Alhaji Abubakar Tafawa Balewa to become Prime Minister.\nAs I said earlier, Nnamdi Kanu is among the Igbo youths that are thoroughly dissatisfied with Nigeria. His insistent and uncompromising stance on the issue of referendum and restoration of Biafra rankled the federal government to the extent that upon his return to Nigeria from London on 14 October 2015, he was arrested for alleged treason. News of his arrest led to protests across the south-east and south-south geopolitical zones. Subsequently, he was detained in Kuje prison for over a year and half without trial despite several court orders that he should be released. On November 23 2015, he was eventually arraigned before an Abuja Magistrate Court by the Department of State Services (DSS) on charges of “criminal conspiracy, intimidation and membership of an illegal organisation.” Kanu was released from prison on 28 April 2017 after meeting the stringent bail conditions set by Justice Binta Nyako of the Federal High Court Abuja. Like every non-VIP prisoner in Nigeria, Nnamdi Kanu’s prison experience was dehumanising and demoralising. Yet, going by a poem or letter he released while in prison, it seems that the 18 months incarceration actually strengthened his resolve to continue with the struggle to actualise Biafra. In the poem, he scathingly condemns Buhari’s government, proclaims himself a prisoner of conscience, reiterates the non-violent nature of his agitation, and insists that he is willing to pay the supreme sacrifice for the actualisation of Biafra.\nREAD ALSO: Muhammadu Buhari: Nigeria’s anti-corruption president\nIt must be pointed out that the quest for self-determination, that is, the striving by members of ethnic groups to excise themselves or break away from larger political entities that control their affairs, is one of the most pervasive and persistent movements in human history. In Nigeria, it is not a new phenomenon: for instance, in February 23 1966, Isaac Adaka Boro declared an independent Niger Delta Republic, but his insurrection was quickly and violently put down by the Balewa government. The current demand by IPOB for a referendum that would ultimately lead to the emergence of Biafra is, in an important sense, a continuation of what the late Dim Chukwuemeka Odumegwu-Ojukwu started on May 30, 1967. Now, the quest for self-determination by a collection of linguistically and culturally homogenous communities is both logically and legally justified – and, thus, morally acceptable.\nLogically, it can be validly interpreted as a social extension of the right for personal freedom; from the legal angle it is recognised in international law and jurisprudence as codified in the United Nations (UN) Charter that was ratified in 1945 at the end of World War II. In fact, Article 3 of the Charter provides that “the inadequacy of political, economic, social and educational preparedness should never serve as a pretext for delaying the right to self-determination and independence.” The UN Charter is domesticated in Africa as African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights (ACHP), and was adopted in 21 October, 1986. Before then, different countries had signed and ratified the document at different times: for example, it was signed, ratified, and deposited by the Nigerian government on 31 August 1982, 22 June 1983 and 22 July 1983 respectively. The major problem with the charters and resolutions of these international organisations is that they did not insist on full independence as the best way of obtaining self-determination or self-government, nor did they include an enforcement mechanism. In addition, in the UN Charter, any new state that emerges was recognised by the legal doctrine of uti possidetis juris, meaning that old administrative boundaries would become international boundaries after independence if they had little relevance to linguistic, ethnic and cultural demarcations.\nFrom the foregoing, it is evident that the movement for self-determination is on solid logical, legal and moral footing. But actualising it in practice is a very challenging task indeed as demonstrated by the fact that only a small percentage of secessionist agitations throughout history had been successful, out of which most were achieved through violent methods. It follows that leaders of any separatist movement must think long and hard before embarking on it because of the profound repercussions on peoples’ lives, which always bother on life and death and on future generations that would have to deal with the profound unintended consequences of secession whether successful or not. Nevertheless, when a critical mass of indigenes of an ethnic nationality or closely related nationalities have genuine reasons to feel unwanted or marginalised for long periods of time within a larger geopolitical entity, the need for a separate independent country could be the best option for them in spite of the inherent dangers of secession.\nHaving laid very briefly the philosophical or theoretical foundation for understanding the phenomenon of self-determination and the landmines on the road to it, let us now consider what Nnamdi Kanu has been saying concerning President Muhammadu Buhari and the country, Nigeria. In my opinion, the best way to do so is to listen attentively to his broadcasts in Radio Biafra. By merely reading his posts on social media, one misses the significant emotional content of his actual speeches, which is an essential aspect of his message and a subtle index of his level of commitment to the Biafran cause. Of course, I am very conscious of the fact that haters of Ndigbo with keen noses for sniffing out ethnicity where there is none are incapable of appreciating the simulacra of truth in Nnamdi Kanu’s thought-provoking claims. Similarly, it is easy and convenient to excoriate anyone who does not join the sycophantic bandwagon in dismissing the IPOB leader and his group. Yet, truth, or more accurately fidelity to the truth, is the most enduring effective weapon against ignorance, intellectual laziness and sycophancy. My analysis, therefore, will be guided by the truth within the scaffolding of awareness of human fallibility. People are fond of quoting the cliché that everyone is entitled to his or her own opinion, but they forget that such entitlement, in order to be rational, must be premised on the presumption that the opinion is supported with, or based on, good reasons. Besides, no one is entitled to his or her own facts because facts, although difficult to ascertain oftentimes, are largely independent of opinions.\nFor months, Nnamdi Kanu has been telling the world repeatedly that the person currently parading himself as President Muhammadu Buhari is an impostor from Sudan named Jubril Aminu al-Sudani. According to him, the real Buhari died on January 27, 2017 and was buried in Saudi Arabia. But not wanting a repeat of the Umaru Yar’Adua scenario of 2010, leading members of the so-called Fulani cabal in Buhari’s administration led by Abba Kyari (Chief of Staff to the President) quickly recruited a Buhari look-alike from Sudan who, after some cosmetic surgeries to enhance the resemblance and coaching to mimic the dead Buhari as closely as possible, brought him back to Nigeria to act as President.\nNnamdi Kanu knows full well that, to be taken seriously, such a consequential, disturbing and terrifying claim must be backed by strong evidence. Hence during several broadcast episodes he takes up the challenge by presenting information that can either be corroborated or refuted through thorough investigation. To begin with, the IPOB leader quickly dismissed the false claim attributed to him that Buhari was cloned. He insists that the original Buhari had died and was replaced by a decoy or look-alike from Sudan. Kanu points to the example of Josef Stalin and Adolf Hitler as leaders that used impersonators mostly for security reasons.

We therefore caution against the current drama of politicising the issue of corruption in the country.”\nThe party said no amount of intimidation, blackmail and propaganda by the Presidency would stop it from standing shoulder to shoulder with Nigerians in demanding that the President kick-start his government and commence implementation of his campaign promises.\nThe statement described as “lame and diversionary” claims by the Presidency that the financial mess created by the last PDP led administration was still being cleared.\nPresident Buhari had stated that he met a near empty treasury and huge debts at the time he assumed the Presidency on May 29, a situation he said, was one of the reasons for the delay in appointing his cabinet ministers.\nBut the PDP said the delay is creating loopholes through which some persons claiming closeness to the President have infiltrated executive bodies, arm-twisting and conniving with unscrupulous elements in the bureaucracy to siphon the nation’s resources in the last 30 days.\nThe statement added that the PDP would not in any way be cowed by threats and wild allegations by the Presidency into abdicating its responsibility of speaking out as an opposition party where the system is derailing.\n“The PDP and indeed all well-meaning Nigerians were appalled by the response from the Presidency regarding our call for prayers to enable President Muhammadu Buhari-led APC administration locate its bearing, compose a government and halt the prevailing stagnation with its huge negative impact on the system.\n“Instead of addressing the issues raised, the Presidency descended to insults, abuses and innuendos, a stance which not only bears out the case made by the PDP but also raises questions about the capacity of this administration to shoulder the enormous responsibility of governance.\n“Furthermore, the analogy of the Augean stable is completely baffling to us at this level as it goes to a great length to question the capacity and the sincerity of those around the President.\n“In Greek mythology, Hercules in his ingenuity took the task and efficiently cleared the Augean’ stable in a day for which he demanded a reward of a tenth of fine cattle belonging to the king.\n“Nigerians would not want to believe that in the so-called clearing of the Augean stable, although not delivering in one day, President Buhari wants to play Hercules in his demand, this time, by wanting to run the government alone without the statutory components of the executive as enshrined in the constitution.\n“We ask, is the so-called clearing of mess responsible for his inability after 90 days of winning an election to make up his mind on rudimentary appointments such as Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Chief of Staff and his demand for 15 Special Advisers as approved by the PDP controlled Seventh Assembly since June 5, 2015?\n“Perhaps we need to draw President Buhari’s attention to the fact that while he is busy clearing his imaginary mess on the pages of newspapers, some persons claiming closeness to him have in the last 30 days been piling up sleazes that also need his attention in key agencies of government.”","1":"http://thenationonlineng.net/new/buharis-anti-corruption-drive-unsettles-pdp/","2":"840","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.999994278"},{"0":"By Festus Ahon, ASABA\nSPECIAL Adviser to the Deputy President of the Nigerian Senate on Special Duties, Mr Godwin Anaughe, Tuesday, said if not for the intervention of President Muhammadu Buhari, Nigeria would have been a failed State in totality like Venezuela, the way PDP was going.\nAnaughe in an interview with the Vanguard, said; “the economy was in a free fall due to falling crude oil prices when President Buhari took over the office in May 2015. It eventually went into recession in the second quarter of 2016 due to falling crude oil prices and renewed restiveness in the Niger Delta, as the falling annual real GDP growth that began in 2013 spiraled into negative territory.\n“Buhari stopped the slide into depression in the second quarter of 2018, after five consecutive quarters of negative growth and put the economy on the path to recovery.\n“Unfortunately, again in 2019, Nigeria slided into its worst economic recession in over three decades, with a contraction of 3.62 percent in the third quarter due to the COVID-19 pandemic that affected every country of the world.\n“But this time, Nigeria exited the recession earlier than expected in the next quarter due to growth in non-oil sector; taken holistically, as government policy to make this sector the main growth sector began to yield results.\n“Since then, the Nigerian economy has continued on a positive trajectory, growing for the seventh consecutive quarter, even though foreign exchange earnings have lagged behind for most period.\n“According to the recent GDP report released by the National Bureau of Statistics, Nigeria’s gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 3.54% year-on-year in real terms in the second quarter of 2022. This is a testament to the fact that the Nigerian economy is performing very well in a number of respects right now, especially in agriculture.\n“In the area of infrastructure development, the Buhari administration has continued to prioritise long-term infrastructure spending to catalyze rapid economic development. This has made it possible for the government to complete long-abandoned projects such as the Lagos-Ibadan, Warri-Itakpe rail network, over 200 dams and Irrigation projects and no fewer than five airports.\n“The Second Niger bridge and the Lagos-Ibadan expressway, abandoned for 16 years by the PDP will be completed this year. Over 13, 000 kilometres of roads, including bridges, are at different stages of completion across the country.\n“Greater long-term infrastructure investment has made the economy stronger and better able to withstand external shocks, especially falling crude oil prices under the Buhari administration.\nThe bottom line is that the PDP created the great mess we have in the country today. It wasted the huge revenue from oil during the period they were in government.\n“Buhari and APC inherited this mess in 2015, prevented the country from going downhill, put Nigeria back on its feet and began the long hard road to recovery by building a solid foundation for a diversified, strong, economy that will produce the desperately needed jobs and business opportunities for our people.\n“Had President Buhari not intervened, Nigeria would have been a failed State in totality like Venezuela, the way PDP was going. Unfortunately, the government is not given the high marks it deserves for its accomplishments.\n“The perception out there among a large number of Nigerians is that the government is not doing anything and the communication effort from Aso Rock has been uncertain and ineffective for the most part to say the least. The government, the APC and the presidential campaign need to do a far better job making their case to the Nigerian people”.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"http://www.vanguardngr.com/2010/02/13/how-the-colonial-masters-empowered-the-north-%e2%80%94-chief-mbazulike-amechi/but","2":"798","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999904633"},{"0":"Pic 5.

One is the supply and installation of motorised portable hydraulic compressor for the Transmission Company of Nigeria, TCN, in favour of Messrs Intern Equipment Nigeria Limited in the sum of US$502,950 plus N15,800,000.\n“The second approval was also received for the award of the contract for the supply and delivery of three sets of online partial discharge measurement and monitoring equipment for the TCN in favour of Messrs T and D Technology Limited in the sum of US$ 874,800 offshore plus N240,100,000 onshore with a delivery period of nine months.\n“The third approval was the award of the contract for the repairs of 100 MVA and four sets of 60 MVA 132 33 power transformers for TCN in favour of GT Engineering Limited in the sum of US$ 661,220 offshore and N127,758,781 onshore with a delivery period of 12 months.\n“On the last one, approval was also granted for the contract for procurement of 10 sets of 330 KV and 30 sets of 133 KV circuit breaker for the TCN in favour of Horsepower Engineering Trading Limited in the sum of US$ 502,719 plus N114,571,500 with a delivery period of six months.”\nAlso briefing, the Minister of Environment said the Council ratified an anticipatory approval received from President Muhammadu Buhari on the nation’s Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC), which is part of its commitment to the climate change pact.\nHe explained that the contribution, which saw Nigeria agreeing to cut greenhouse gas emission by 20 percent as at last year and by 45 percent in 2030, adding that part of the obligations to the signatories of the agreement is the revision of the progress and the submission of an interim report every five years.\nHe said: “The Federal Ministry of Environment presented a memo today, seeking for the ratification of an anticipatory approval that we received from Mr. President, on the submission of our primary NDC, that is the Nationally Determined Contribution.\n“This is part of the commitment that Nigeria made in 2016 during the Paris Agreement; that every country, after five years, will revise the commitment the country made in cutting down emission.\n‘’So, at the time we committed to reducing emission by 20 percent, unconditionally, meaning we can do it by ourselves. That’s by 2020. The 20 percent is by the year 2020. At the same time, we are also committed to reducing 45% by 2030. That’s again from the year 2016.\n“So, we did the first the interim report, a country is supposed to send in an interim report to the United Nations Climate Change desk, and then before July 31, you’ll now submit the final report.\n‘’We have done that and part of this reporting is again, for every country, doing that will put the country on a good footing as far as climate change action is concerned and this has a number of sectors that we depended on to be able to reach this: Power, Agriculture, Transportation.\n“These are areas that we used as part of attending to that commitment that we made and today, we have gotten the approval of the ratification following that statutory approval by Mr. President. So, Nigeria is currently in good standing, as about 100 countries have already submitted and Nigeria is one of those,” he explained.\nAsked if Nigeria achieved the 20 percent emission cut as at last year, Mahmood said “yes, we have. Since the ratification of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change in 2016 and even before then, government has put in a number of interventions to deal with the issue of climate change. You see, climate change did not just start in 2016. 2016 happened to be just like the culmination of the problem that showed and there’s need for an immediate action on climate change.\n“So, the government rolled out a number of things and this was even before I became a minister and we have done so much, I can give you an example. That was when we started the issuance of green bond and bond issuance is to generate money, solely for green projects.\n“Based on our calculations, we have met that 20 percent last year, in fact, I can even say we have surpassed that. That’s why we took that as unconditional, it’s something that we know already we can.”\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"https://www.vanguardngr.com/2021/08/fec-approves-2-5m-n498-2m-for-4-power-projects-2/","2":"1236","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999809265"},{"0":"The domain name\nYESHARVEST.COM is for sale.\n$3140Lease to Own\n$302 / monthExpert curated premium domain name\nProfessionally crafted logo design\nGuaranteed transfer or your money back\nYes Harvest: A simple combination that implies mindful food production.

You have the right to cancel the lease any time or complete all payments early to own the domain outright.\nEstablished in 2007, we are the original business name marketplace. Every year, we sell 1000s of premium domains to entrepreneurs and businesses like you.\nAll of our domain names are handpicked by branding and linguistics experts based on rigorous criteria. You can rest assured that if a domain is on the BrandBucket marketplace, it is a top-tier business name.\nAlmost one out of every four names sold on BrandBucket is sold to a repeat buyer or a referral, which means that people who buy from us once, keep coming back for more.\nThe .com extension is a brand in itself. As the default domain extension of the internet, having a .com domain that is an exact match to your brand name has numerous advantages:\n- Familiarity - People are familiar with .com. Most of the brands and websites they already trust, use the .com extension. Therefore, it serves as a subtle indicator that your business is a legitimate one. A recent study by the NCC Group, a global expert in cybersecurity and risk mitigation, found that roughly half of the consumers are uncomfortable visiting websites ending with a non .com extension, and only 9% are comfortable doing so.\n- Brand Protection - When you own the .com version of a domain name, you have the official online version of that name. Owning an exact-match .com can protect your brand name, as it is unlikely another serious business would use the same name when the .com extension is taken.\n- Easy to Communicate - .com domains are also easy to communicate. When people hear or see your business name without a TLD, they will inevitably assume it ends in .com, making it easy for them to find you online.\nOnce you have received the name into your registrar account, you will be able to:\n- Use the domain as your website address.\n- Setup email addresses, for instance, firstname.lastname@example.org.\n- Use the domain and logo on business cards and other materials.\nIf you don’t have a website built yet, you can put up a simple coming soon page, or you can just leave it until you are ready. You don’t need to do anything right away. Because you own the domain name, you can take your time.\nOur talented community of logo designers designs all logos on the BrandBucket marketplace. They are paid for their efforts, and BrandBucket owns all copyrights for the logos. We will transfer the full copyright for the logo to you upon purchase of the domain name.\nLogo files are delivered to you in the following formats:\n- High-resolution image file (PNG)\n- Editable vector file (.AI)\nEditing your design\nVector (AI) files are entirely editable in programs such as photoshop and illustrator, so you or your designer can make desired changes. If needed, we can make basic color changes/small tweaks to the logo for you after purchase. If you are looking for a complete redesign, we can connect you with a designer from our talented design community at their discretion and price.\nAll of our business domains are carefully chosen for their standout branding qualities. There is only one yesharvest.com. However, there may well be other businesses that are using the same brand name. In fact, with common keyword names, it is likely. That is why owning the .com is so essential. In holding the .com, you immediately establish your business as the most official version of that name. It's unlikely any serious business is going to use a brand name where the .com domain is already in use. Many companies believe that owning the matching .com version of a business name provides more protection for their brand than a trademark.\nNo, and it’s not possible for us to do so. Trademarks are industry and region-specific, and to file a trademark for a name or logo, you must already be doing business as that name. Because of this, we can't trademark a name before your company is actively using it. Therefore, you will need to apply for trademark registration after you have purchased the name.\nWhen you purchase a domain from BrandBucket, you will own it 100%. However, all domain names worldwide must be kept registered at a registrar like Godaddy or similar that you choose. You will pay the registration fees to whichever registrar you decide to use. The price of registration varies at each registrar, but it generally ends up being around $10-15 per year for a .com domain name. Registration is annual but can be paid up for years in advance, which we suggest you do.\nBrandBucket serves as a third-party marketplace and escrow agent for domain names. We only offer refunds if either of these two conditions are met:\n- The buyer contacts us within 24 hours of purchase requesting a refund.\n- The seller fails to initiate the domain name transfer within 10 business days from the time of purchase.\nBuyers are advised to perform all necessary diligence prior to making a purchase.\nYour purchase is 100% confidential. Any personal information you share with BrandBucket is kept private, even from the domain seller. We never publicize any sale on our marketplace.\nA brand name is a name that you use to identify a family of products, services, or a single line of products or services that a company offers. For instance, Apple is the brand name used on most products manufactured by Apple, Inc. In this example, the business name and brand name are the same, a common use case.\nYour brand name is who you are to your customers. It is the pillar your business's public image will be built around. The products or services you offer can also have their own brand names. You may want to create new brand names for products or services that differ from your core business offering, for example:\n- UberEats - Food delivery by Uber\n- Amazon Web Services - Cloud computing from Amazon\n- Google Maps - Web mapping service from Google\nRegistered Business Name\nA business name is the legally registered name of your business. You'll use your business name to create contracts, open bank accounts, pay taxes, and any other administrative related activities. Most business names contain the business's brand name, followed by the company's chosen business structure, for example:\n- Walmart Inc.\n- Verizon Inc.\n- Grasshopper LLC\nHowever, they don't necessarily have to be the same. In some cases, the business name is completely different from the brand name. This is most common in large businesses that have multiple brands housed under a single parent company, for example:\n- Brand Name: Google\n- Business Name: Alphabet Inc.\n- Brand Name: MailChimp\n- Business Name: The Rocket Science Group LLC\nA domain name is your website name - the internet address where people can access your website. Think of a domain as the address to the online version of your business. Every domain is one-of-a-kind. No website has the same web address as another website.\nIdeally, your domain name should be an exact match to your brand name. Think of your favorite companies. Odds are, their domain name is identical to their brand name. Apple's domain name is Apple.com; Amazon's domain name is Amazon.com. Having a matching domain ensures that people can easily find your brand online.\nWhat can a top brand name with a matching .com do for your business? Here are few of the many advantages of owning a premium business domain:\nTrust - Online, there are subtle clues that all of us subconsciously take into consideration to determine whether or not a business is legitimate and trustworthy. Having a great business name paired with a matching .com (by far the most trusted domain extension) signals to customers that you care about and are willing to invest in your brand. It makes your business and your brand messaging easier to trust.\nAuthority - Owning a .com version of a fantastic brand name is a big signal to the world that your business means business, right out of the gate. This can lead to accelerated customer acquisition, more industry partnership opportunities, and press attention.\nSEO - Having a business domain that matches what customers are using in searches can lead to increased SEO, higher page ranking, and better quality traffic.\nRetention - Brand retention is critical for organically acquiring and keeping customers. A short, catchy, and unique business name makes your brand easier to remember, and having a matching .com means that consumers who hear about you offline will find you easily online.\nSave on marketing spend - Investing in a premium domain can save you a fortune in marketing spend down the line. You'll spend less of your valuable marketing budget and efforts on brand awareness, as your name will do much of the work for you.\nOur customers are primarily entrepreneurs looking for a quick and easy way to find a great brand name for their company. That's why when evaluating and appraising domain names, our central focus is whether they would also make great business names.\nWhat makes a great brand name? Here are some of the branding and linguistic traits we take into consideration:\n- Length - Great names are concise and to the point. The shorter, the better!\n- Common phrase/expression - Names that are based on real phrases and expressions make great brand names because of their built-in familiarity and inherent catchiness.\n- Letter order - Some letters are more valuable than others and better together, especially when it comes to the first letters of a name.\n- Pronunciation and spelling - Names should be easy to say and understand. It should also be spelled as it sounds.\n- Industry match - Names should be a good fit for a particular industry, or be broad enough to attract buyers from multiple sectors.\n- Longevity - Great brand names are broad enough in scope to grow with a company as it expands and not die when trends fade.\n- Uniqueness - Great brand names are easy to spot because they stand out in a crowd.\n- Memorability - A brand name is no good unless people can easily remember it.\nThese criteria, along with historical sales data and current marketplace conditions, are used to determine whether a name is accepted to our marketplace, and how it's priced. Every name on our marketplace must score high in most or all of these categories to even be accepted. With an acceptance rate of only 10% of names submitted to our marketplace, BrandBucket sets a very high bar for the names we select.\nCustomers Also Loved\nThe following are business names for sale with similar qualities to yesharvest.com","1":"https://www.yesharvest.com/?referral_code=8BLLXU","2":"2968","3":"Food","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999427795"},{"0":"By Chinonso Alozie, Owerri\nSuspected hoodlums on Monday shot sporadically at MCC junction in Owerri metropolis.\nThe shooting which happened at about 05: 10 pm, forced passersby as well as traders to scamper for their safety.\nMany motorists drove roughly out of the venue. commuters waiting for buses to go home all ran for their lives.\nIt was also learnt that vehicles on noticing what was happening turned away to other adjoining streets.\nHowever, as of the time of filing this story normalcy has returned back to the area as businesses and vehicular movement have started again.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"https://www.vanguardngr.com/2021/04/just-in-again-panic-as-suspected-hoodlums-shot-sporadically-in-owerri/","2":"147","3":"Politics","4":"0","5":"en","6":"0.9999866486"},{"0":"By Levinus Nwabughiogu\nABUJA – President Muhammadu Buhari is due to leave Abuja for Paris, French capital Monday on a three-day official visit to France.\nThe visit was at the instance of French President, Mr. Francois Hollande.\nPresident Buhari will be accompanied on the visit by the National Security Adviser, Major-Gen.

Senators set another hurdle for Buhari\nPublic hearing demand likely\nLoans not a trap, says DMO boss\nSenators have put another hurdle in the way of the presidential request for approval to obtain $29.9billion loans for infrastructure.\nLast week, the Senate threw out the request – on the grounds that it was not accompanied with how the loan would be used and repaid.\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari, according to sources, has secured the understanding of Senate President Bukola Saraki that the request will be reconsidered when re-presented, with details, expectedly this week. But senators are pressing that the request should be taken for public hearing before approval, The Nation learnt.\nThe public hearing clause is one of the conditions most of the senators have given Saraki before approving the loans.\nIt was unclear yesterday whether the Senate President will accede to this condition.\nA source in the National Assembly said: “We are amenable to the re-presentation of the request for the loans by the President. The law or our Standing Rules allows it.\n“Most of us have however told the Senate President that we should subject the request to public hearing because the debts will be paid back in 20 years by the next generation.\n“Also, if ex-President Olusegun Obasanjo could secure debt relief of over $30billion, Nigerians need to be part of this latest decision to incur $29.9billion.\n“Some of us feel that if we throw the request open, we may get alternative ideas from Nigerians.”\nA first term Senator said: “We are pushing for public hearing to enable Nigerians scrutinise what the loans will be used for. We want them to buy into it.\n“Some of us will also be able to sleep well that the decision to obtain the loans has the backing of all Nigerians.”\nA ranking Senator said: “We are not opposed to a fresh request from the President but we prefer public hearing. I want a situation whereby I will be able to tell my children why the Senate supported the taking of the loans.\n“We cannot take things for granted again. The government said it will spend about N500billion on social investment but up till now, Senators, members of the House of Representatives and even governors are kept in the dark.\n“We do not know the shape of the programmes, how beneficiaries were drawn up and whether or not the teachers to be recruited are relevant to the need of each of the 36 states and the FCT.\n“If we are unsure of how N500billion will be spent, then we need to subject the $29.9billion loans to public hearing.”\nAnother ranking Senator said: “Public hearing is not a must when the Executive needs loans. All we have to do is to refer the request to the Committee on Local and Foreign Debts, which is headed by Sen. Shehu Sani.\n“Our colleagues are demanding for public hearing but this will amount to double standards. When we got requests for loans from Edo and Lagos states, we did not conduct any hearing. We considered the applications on merit.”\n“We will leave the discretion to the President of the Senate.”\nThe President had said the external borrowing plan would be used for infrastructure, agriculture, health, education , water supply , growth and employment generation , poverty reduction through social safety net programmes and governance and financial management reforms etc.\nHe said: “The total cost of the projects and programmes under the borrowing (rolling) plan is $29.960billion made up of proposed projects and programmes loan of $11.274billion, Special National Infrastructure projects $10.686billion, Euro bonds of $4.5 billion and Federal Government budget support of $3.5billion.”","1":"http://thenationonlineng.net/29-9b-loans-senators-set-another-hurdle-buhari/","2":"808","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999580383"},{"0":"HON BOMA VS DSS IN ABUJA A member House of Representative, Hon Boma Goodhead in face-off with the official of DSS at the entrance of National Assembly in Abuja on Tuesday Photo by Gbemiga Olamikan\nON April 18, 2018, some hoodlums broke into the hallowed plenum of the Senate, rough-handled everyone on their path and made away with the Mace.\nTill today, nothing tangible has been established as to how they managed to breach the heavy security presence at the National Assembly Complex. Who were the perpetrators and their sponsors? What are the law enforcement agencies doing to bring them to book?\nAgain, following the recent defection of the President of the Senate, Dr. Bukola Saraki and other federal legislators from the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC, to the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, pressure built within the APC towards a change of leadership in the National Assembly. The National Chairman of the party, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole and the Senate Leader, Ahmed Lawan, pressed for the re-convening of the National Assembly which is currently on annual recess.\nOn Tuesday, August 7, 2018, hooded and heavily-armed men of the Directorate of State Services,DSS, acting on the proverbial “orders from above”, barricaded the gates of the National Assembly Complex, fueling speculations of plots to remove Saraki and his Deputy, Ike Ekweremadu. The attentions of the entire nation, local and international media, as well as foreign embassies in Nigeria, were drawn to the unfolding outrageous assault on our democracy.\nIt came as a massive relief when the Acting President, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo, after disclosing that his office knew nothing about the DSS deployments, announced the sack of the Service’s powerful Director- General, Alhaji Lawal Daura. It was also quite shocking because of Daura’s closeness to President Muhammadu Buhari who was holidaying in London.\nDaura’s sack, coming from a government not known to discipline its erring top officials, is a welcome development. But we demand answers to this question: Who were behind these assaults on our legislative arm, including the Police blockade of Saraki and Ekweremadu’s residences and the aborted attempt by eight lawmakers to impeach Governor Samuel Ortom in Benue State, in which the Police also played ignoble roles?\nUnless these lawbreakers are fished out and severely punished, the sack of Daura would seem like a mere subterfuge to cover what some see as grand plans by the state to sideline our Constitution and enthrone dictatorship.\nThe nation cannot afford the continuation of the feud between the Presidency and the National Assembly. The two sides must put aside politics and close ranks to secure funds for the conduct of the 2019 general elections and other outstanding matters. The National Assembly must be given a conducive atmosphere to reconvene and address these issues.\nIf there is a need for regime change, the NASS members must be allowed to decide in accordance with the law.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"https://www.vanguardngr.com/2022/09/obi-has-no-bullion-van-of-questionable-wealth-obidients-tackle-pro-tinubu-group/Yet","2":"664","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999809265"},{"0":"APC, 20 others join forces to tackle anti-Buhari coalition\nBalarabe Musa knocks PDP-led coalition\nMoghalu: it lacks agenda\nTwenty-four hours after a group of 38 parties announced the Coalition of United Political Parties (CUPP) to wrest power from President Muhammadu Buhari, another group of 20 political parties yesterday joined forces with the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) in an alliance to form the Coalition of Progressives Political Parties (CPPP)\nAlso yesterday, Peoples Redemption Party (PRP) Chairman and former Kaduna State Governor Balarabe Musa described the coalition against Buhari “as an act of opportunism.”\nA presidential aspirant of the Young Progressives Party (YPP) also lashed out at the PDP-led coalition for its “lack of any real agenda to improve the lives of Nigeria.”\nThere are 68 registered political parties and the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) is considering the application for registration of about 138 others.\nThe political parties in pro-Buhari’s CPPP which met in Abuja yesterday, are: All Progressives Congress (APC), Accord Party, Peoples Democratic Movement (PDM), United Progressive Party (UPP), Advanced People’s Democratic Alliance (APDA), Hope Democratic Party (HDP), Democratic Peoples Party (DPP) and Unity Party of Nigeria (UPN).\nOthers are: Freedom Justice Party (FJP), Fresh Party (FP), New Nigeria’s Peoples Party (NNPP), Nigeria’s Peoples Congress (NPC), Nigeria Peoples Movement (NPM), Allied Congress Party of Nigeria (ACPN), National Action Congress (NAC) and NDLP.\nThe chairman of the coalition, who is also the National chairman of PDM, Alhaji Bashir Yusuf Ibrahim, told reporters after hours of meeting at the Transcorp Hilton, Abuja that the coalition was made up of like-minded political parties who believe in Nigeria’s unity and stability.\nHe noted that the coalition, which was formed in 2014 ahead of the 2015 presidential election aligned with the candidature of President Buhari, then the APC candidate.\nIbrahim said the coalition was merely resurrected to counter the orchestrated PDP coalition against the APC-led government.\nBerating the PDP coalition, he said the parties were driven by selfishness and hunger to capture power in 2019.\nHe explained that the parties that formed the coalition with the PDP lacked the agenda to drive a new Nigeria.\nThe PDM chairman alleged that most of the parties in the PDP coalition were fraudulently included to sign the MoU to deceive Nigerians.\nHe noted that while the Accord Party chairman and his party, the PDM, among others, abstained from the PDP meeting, their parties’ names were listed without their consent. This, he said, raised doubts about the credibility of the coalition.\nHe said: “Yesterday (Monday) we woke up to a new development where PDP outside power has now managed to create another coalition. As facts continue to emerge, they listed 36 political parties. Our analysis of that coalition reveals that a number of political parties were included in that coalition fraudulently.\n“Part of the 42 political parties they listed is Accord party and the chairman of the party is here with us. If you are creating a coalition, you need to be honest about it as to who and who are members of the coalition.\n“As of today, the membership of that coalition is in doubt. Two members also listed at that coalition are here. We are not part of that coalition because we represent a political type of politics which is in total contradiction of what they are doing.\n“We do not believe that our country should be governed by people whose only objective is to capture power. For what purpose is that coalition built? Is it for the purpose of taking Nigeria back to 1999 and 2015 or is it for the purpose of building a new Nigeria?\n“That purpose has not been stated, even their in their memorandum. The only thing in their MoU is to agree to capture power in 2019. Their programme has not been made known to the Nigerian public . We will not be part of a coalition that does not have a programme for Nigeria.”\nOn the objective of the CPPP coalition, Ibrahim said it was to mobilise Nigerians to play a greater role in political activities and ensure that they are given the right to elect their leaders in a free. fair and credible electoral process.\nHe said the agenda included to monitor and exert pressure on INEC to uphold the sanctity of elections and to help identify security threat, among others.\nThe secretary of the Coalition and National Chairman of the Advanced People’s Democratic Alliance (APDA), Shittu Muhammed Kabiru, noted that the coalition was to advance the course of democracy and to stabilise the economy which was mismanaged by past PDP- led governments.\nShittu said the coalition would bring Nigeria out of economic impoverishment.\n“We want Nigerians to know that our coalition is for a new Nigeria and to advance the cause of Nigeria and democracy and also to change the country from impoverishment to economic prosperity.\n“We want Nigeria to survive.

That Okorocha who behaved as if he owned the state and party is now the person organizing protests and boycotting party congress.\n“While I join those laughing at Governor Okorocha because he has been served in his own cup, Imo people should know that those who are now fighting the Governor were those who lied to all of us and put him there for selfish reasons and brought the state to this shameful state. We should get to reject them in 2019.”\nIn his view, Mr. Elvis Agukwe, said: “This is the struggle to restore Imo state. It is the struggle to restore the party. I can tell you so far so good. It is a struggle to break barriers. It is a struggle for emancipation in Imo state.\n“This is to tell you that after your regime you go and another person will take over. What we are seeing in Imo state is that Okorocha is entangled in a power struggle.”\nSpeaking also, the members representing Aboh Mbaise state constituency in the Imo state House of Assembly, Mr Mike Iheanetu, said: “What is happening in Imo APC is a by product of bad politics. These are visionless strange political fellows. I said this because APC, was never contemplated on a good intention. They were only ready to wrestle power from the PDP.\n“Since they got into power they have never met together for any assignment. This is the first time they are meeting together to behave as a political party. They are not used to it and as not a democratically set up party.\n“If you bring down to Imo state, Rochas has been in this one man business show. He chooses when to play card as he wanted. You recall, in 2015, he gave his ticket to his son-in-law and said he was going to contest for presidency and when he failed he came back and collected the ticket.”\nIn his opinion, the Imo State Organizing Secretary of Labour Party, LP, Mr. Igboayaka. O. Igboayaka, “Any party that lacks internal democracy cannot lead Imo state. APC lacks Internal democracy. A party that it’s congress is characterized by writing of result sheets cannot assumed the leadership of the state.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"https://www.google.com.ng/amp/s/www.vanguardngr.com/2018/05/apc-nwc-foiled-attempt-okorocha-stop-imo-lg-congresses/amp/","2":"1745","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.999879837"},{"0":"Ugwuanyi: Redefining governance at 56\nLouis Amoke assesses the performance of Enugu State Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi who clocks 56 today\nHe is no less a child of providence. Attaining 56 years of age on March 20, Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi of Enugu State is certainly the man of the moment for so many obvious reasons. With his unique disposition to life, the governor has come a long way navigating with peacefulness, humility, caring, compassion, vision, hard-work and the fear of his beloved God. He has carved a niche for himself as an outstanding leader whose approach to handling issues remains unbeatable and enduring.\nThe governor’s birthday is the first after his inauguration for a second term in office following his overwhelming reelection by the people of Enugu State. He won with an unprecedented 95.54 percent of the votes cast, the highest in the history of the country and this is symbolic and yet another opportunity to appreciate God, through acts of charity, for his mercy and kindness.\nTo this great man of faith and goodwill, compassionate in uplifting the downtrodden and resolute in entrenching peace and good governance in the state, the anniversary, is as always, people-centered and a boost to continue to serve with the fear of God and render selfless service to the state and humanity.\nIt is on record that Gov. Ugwuanyi’s penchant for the wellbeing of the people, especially the needy and downtrodden in the society, has been unequalled and a great source of strength.\nIn ensuring peace and good governance in Enugu State, the governor in spite of the nation’s security and economic challenges, has continued to make sacrifices and work round the clock to sustain the state’s enviable peaceful atmosphere and enhance the delivery of service to the people at every level of the state.\nAs an unassuming leader, Gov. Ugwuanyi is at peace with everybody; he relates and interacts with both the high and the low; he listens, tolerates, accommodates and cares; and most importantly, fears and serves God, faithfully. He has no enemy and always pays the ultimate price for peace to reign. The governor is one who delights in the joy of his people and shares in their grief as well.\nGov. Ugwuanyi also delights in addressing grey issues that are paramount to the wellbeing of the people, especially the lowly and long neglected who had hitherto been denied the dividends of democracy.\nHis administration’s widely cherished rural development policy, which has provided the veritable platform to address the hydra-headed imbalance between urban and rural dwellers in terms of distribution of amenities, indeed, caused a spontaneous revolution that brought about massive infrastructural development in the rural areas.\nThe state government’s grassroots-development initiative has, therefore, ensured a systematic concentration of infrastructural developments more in the rural areas that were hitherto in dearth of amenities, helplessly. The special attention to rural areas, where the majority of the people reside, was borne out of the governor’s vision to give every citizen of the state a sense of belonging.\nIt is on record that Ugwuanyi’s administration has profusely invested huge resources in developing the rural communities, concentrating development projects in the remote villages to create more urban centres for socio-economic growth.\nIn this regard, communities such as Amurri and Ogonogoeji in Nkanu West LGA, Eha-Amufu in Isi-Uzo LGA, Ukpabi-Nimbo-Ugbene Ajima-Eziani in Uzo-Uwani LGA and Akpugoeze in Oji River LGA, that had not experienced state government presence for many decades, have been remembered with one development project or the other.\nThe sum of N3.4 billion was appropriated in the 2020 budget, for the establishment of a Small/Medium-sized Industry in each of the seventeen (17) local government areas of the state, at an average sum of N200 million per LGA.\nWhile all these were going on, the Ugwuanyi administration through its urban renewal drive has equally ensured provision of critical infrastructure, beautification and upgrade of facilities in the urban areas, while restoring Enugu city to its original master-plan. The state government in its 2020 budget also captured the construction of the Enugu first ever flyover and completion of the International Conference Centre (ICC), among other legacy projects, to enhance the status and socio-economic potentials of the state capital.\nOn the whole, about 600 kilometers of road across the state have been covered so far by Ugwuanyi’s administration.\nThis is in addition to remarkable achievements in other sectors of development such as security, state workers’ welfare, education, health, empowerment, investment promotion, agriculture, Judiciary infrastructural transformation, among others.\nOnly recently, the state workers trooped out in their numbers and marched through the streets of Enugu to the Government House, in jubilation, to thank Ugwuanyi for being the first governor of the state, since the inception of democracy in 1999, to pay them the minimum wage without rancour.\nThe jubilant workers, who were led by the state leadership of the Organised Labour, sang solidarity songs and displayed banners/ placards with inscriptions such as: “Enugu State workers say Thank You His Excellency for the new minimum wage”, “Gburus, Enugu workers say Thank You for regular payment of salaries”, “Gburus, thank you for giving us new minimum wage without stress”, “Thank you for regular payment of monthly pensions”, “Gburus, you are a pacesetter”, “Gburus is our man”.\nThey told the people’s governor that the workers were surprised and elated to receive their salary alerts during the weekend reflecting the new minimum wage in line with the agreed consequential adjustment chart.\nAccording to them, “today is a special day in the history of Enugu State. This is because there is no worker in Enugu State that did not benefit from Ugwuanyi’s alert, and that is why we are singing now”.\nNarrating other numerous interventions of the governor towards the welfare of the state workers, such as the 100 units of one-bedroom flats for civil servants between grade levels 01-10, regular payment of salaries and pensions and the payment of 13th month salary, the workers pointed out that “It’s instructive that Gov. Ugwuanyi was recording such feats at a time when many states could not pay their workers’ salaries”.\nSpeaking at the event, the state chairman of the Trade Union Congress (TUC) of Nigeria, Comrade Benneth Asogwa maintained that the state workers marched to the Government House to let the world know that “it is because you have been able to turn the history positively as far as minimum wage is concerned in Enugu State”.\nAccording to him, “we want to also tell them (the world) that what we are doing today is significant because in the past, whenever minimum wage was being expected, it was always negative. Then, we would mourn from, maybe, New Haven to our Secretariat crying and shouting. Then, you would see all Enugu in pains. But today, we have come to Government House, smiling”.\nComrade Asogwa, who maintained that this was the first time the workers had a salary chart that was a product of collective bargaining, told Governor Ugwuanyi that “the greatest political party you have identified with is the public service and you are a full registered member and we can tell you that you have our mandate, anytime.”\nHis words: “I want to summarise by saying that history will never forget your regime. We stand here to say that in Enugu State, we have worked for years without salary chart until somebody called Dr. Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi, a.k.a Gburugburu, came and the dignity of workers was restored. We stand here today to say, Your Excellency, we are very grateful”.\nOn the significance of the governor’s 56th birthday, the time-honoured occasion, symbolically reinvigorates his commitment to charity and almsgiving – a constant moral obligation in appreciation of God’s goodness and amazing grace to him as “Nwaogbenye”.\nThe anniversary offers him and his family, friends, well-wishers, and teeming supporters, who have remained steadfast in prayers, yet another opportunity to give to the poor and less privileged in the society with all sense of divinity and benevolence.\nConsequently, the pet project of the governor’s wife, Ugo’s Touch of Life Foundation, is at the moment offering one week free medical outreach across the 17 LGAs of the state, in collaboration with Dr. Chukwudi Abraham Nneji Hospital Organisation, Germany, to celebrate the governor’s birthday.\nThis humanitarian exercise is in keeping with the governor’s long-held appeal that those who intended to offer him birthday gifts should deploy them to charity in appreciation of God’s mercy and kindness as well as in the spirit of the Lenten Season.\nAs we celebrate with the people’s governor, it is our collective responsibility to continue to appreciate God‘s abundant blessings upon him and his family’s life, reflect and pray fervently for continued peace and good governance, and encourage him to hold on tightly to his sound vision to take Enugu State to the next level. Happy Birthday, His Excellency. Enugu State is truly in the hands of God!","1":"https://thenationonlineng.net/ugwuanyi-redefining-governance-at-56/","2":"2074","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999828339"},{"0":"Makarfi, Obi working for APC chieftain – Sheriff\nThere seems to be no let-up in the leadership crisis rocking the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) as the combatants continue to dig deeper into the trenches.\nThe party’s embattled National Chairman; Alhaji Ali Modu Sheriff Friday accused the Chairman of the PDP caretaker committee, Senator Ahmed Makarfi and Secretary of the committee, Senator Ben Obi of working for a prominent chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC).\nSpeaking at a media briefing in Abuja, Sheriff said the unnamed APC chieftain has been sponsoring Makarfi and Obi have been paying secret visits to the said APC chieftain.\nMakarfi and his committee have continued to insist that Sheriff was being sponsored by the APC for the purpose of destroying the PDP.\nBut Sheriff retorted, “If there are people in the PDP working for the APC, it’s Makarfi and Obi. Makarfi should not force me to reveal details that I should not reveal under normal circumstances.\n“Makarfi and Obi have gone to visit this APC chieftain in his house twice and this particular individual is still in the APC.

If Makarfi continues to attack my person, I will be forced to reveal further details of their alliance.\n“Everybody in Nigeria knows this particular APC chieftain who wants to contest for president in 2019 on the platform of the PDP. So Makarfi should just shut up”.\nSheriff had, earlier in the day, received a delegation of PDP chieftains from Plateau state who came to declare support for his leadership.\nThe leader of the delegation, Dr. Haruna Dabin said the delegation decided to support Sheriff because he is the only one that can stop the culture of impunity in the PDP.\nDabin said, “We have decided to stand with Sheriff on the path of truth and the rule of law. We are confident in his ability to heal the wounds in our party”\nThe Plateau PDP chief said his group was short-hanged during the last congress held in the state, adding that winners in the congress were handpicked and imposed on the chapter.\nResponding, Sheriff assured them that the congress in Plateau would be revisited, with the view to correcting the mistakes of the past.\n“You cannot put nothing on nothing, so I will never associate myself with what is not right. I will make sure that PDP lives up to its name. So I will work hard to ensure that the right people are elected in Plateau and other states through fresh congresses.”","1":"http://thenationonlineng.net/makarfi-obi-working-apc-chieftain-sheriff/","2":"614","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.999994278"},{"0":"Banks fail CBN’s stress test on foreign operations\n- Financial institutions’ Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) drops to 11.2%, below 15% threshold\nEight commercial banks have fallen short of the Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) required for international authorisation, the stress test conducted by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has shown.\nThe affected banks have been put under pressure to raise their capital base to bridge the gap, which was brought about by the depreciation of the naira against the dollar and other foreign currencies\nThrough its 2021 guidelines, the CBN had mandated the Deposit Money Banks to maintain a prudential CAR of 10 per cent for national and regional banks.\nThose with international authorisation were instructed to uphold a 15 per cent regulatory CAR.\nHowever, the CBN report showed a decline in the banking system’s CAR, dropping to 11.2 per cent, which is 3.0 per cent short.\nThis is below the 15.0 per cent threshold set for banks with international authorisation.\nThe decline in the banks’ CAR was attributed to a decrease in total qualifying capital relative to increased risk-weighted assets due to the naira’s depreciation following the adoption of a market-determined exchange rate policy. This reflects the challenges faced by these institutions.\nThe banks were scrutinised based on their capital strength and risk profile, a crucial measure of a bank’s financial stability.\nThe stress test was conducted to assess the banks’ financial health and their ability to withstand adverse economic conditions and shocks.\nSpecifically, the test focused on the CAR, which measures the proportion of a bank’s capital to its risk-weighted assets and is used to determine the bank’s financial stability.\nThe CAR is a regulatory requirement set by the CBN and each bank is expected to maintain a minimum level of capital to ensure their ability to absorb potential losses.\nBased on the results of the stress test, it was discovered that among the affected banks with international authorisation, their capital adequacy ratio was lower than the minimum regulatory requirement set by the CBN.\nThis implies that these banks may have insufficient capital to meet potential losses during challenging economic conditions, which could potentially impact their overall financial stability.\nThe CBN’s revelation of the banks’ CAR falling below the minimum regulatory requirement emphasises the need for appropriate measures to be taken to address this issue.\nIt could prompt regulatory action, such as requiring the affected banks to raise additional capital or implement strategies to strengthen their financial position to mitigate any potential risks to the banking sector and the economy.\nThe depreciation, stemming from the CBN’s managed float of the exchange rate in June 2023, significantly impacted banks, leading to substantial foreign exchange losses.\nIt also affected the required capital for international, national, and regional banks.\nSpeaking penultimate Friday at the annual dinner of the Chartered Institute of Bankers of Nigeria, CBN Governor Olayemi Cardoso highlighted plans to introduce new capital requirements for banks.\nHe said: “Nigeria’s financial sector has demonstrated resilience in 2023, with key indicators of financial soundness largely meeting regulatory benchmarks.\n“Stress tests conducted on the banking industry also indicate its strength under mild-to-moderate scenarios of sustained economic and financial stress, although there is room for further strengthening and enhancing resilience to shocks.\n“Therefore, there is still much work to be done in fortifying the industry for future challenges, a topic that I will delve into later in my address.\n“It is crucial for us to evaluate the adequacy of our banking industry to serve the envisioned larger economy.\n“It is not just about the stability of the financial system in the present moment, as we have already established that the current assessment shows stability.\n“However, we need to ask ourselves: Will Nigerian banks have sufficient capital relative to the financial system’s needs in servicing a $1.0 trillion economy in the near future? In my opinion, the answer is ‘No!’ unless we take action.\n“Therefore, we must make difficult decisions regarding capital adequacy. As a first step, we will be directing banks to increase their capital.”\nThe report also outlined a positive trend in banks’ asset quality, with a marginal decrease in Non-Performing Loans (NPLs) from 4.5 per cent to 4.1 per cent in the second quarter of 2023, reflecting improvement in loan recoveries and surpassing the prudential benchmark of 5.0 per cent.\nFurthermore, the Industry Liquidity Ratio (LR) witnessed a significant rise, reaching 62.2 per cent in the review quarter, surpassing the minimum regulatory benchmark of 30.0 per cent.\nThis upswing signifies the banks’ robust capacity to fulfil their financial obligations.\nThe CBN’s disclosures underscored the pivotal need for banking institutions, particularly those with international authorisation, to bolster their capital adequacy and navigate the evolving economic landscape.","1":"https://thenationonlineng.net/banks-fail-cbns-stress-test-on-foreign-operations-2/","2":"1050","3":"Business","4":"2","5":"en","6":"0.9999370575"},{"0":"By Levinus Nwabughiogu\nABUJA-Federal government has approved the sum of N4,500 for each of the 200,000 beneficiaries of N-Power Volunteer Corps jobs for the purchase of an enhanced electronic device.\nThe device would be loaded with different applications that would further improve the skills of the beneficiaries and afford them additional training opportunities during the two-year duration of the job program.\nAlso, a total of 149, 669 Nigerian graduates of the 200,000 are now collecting their monthly stipends of N30,000 monthly having been physically verified and deployed across the 36 states and FCT.\nMr. Laolu Akande, the Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity to Vice President Yemi Osinbajo made the disclosure while giving update on the Social Investment Programmes of the present administration.\nAccording to Akande who issued a statement, the device grant was in conjunction with the Bank of Industry (BoI) which has extended an asset finance of 20 months to each of the 200,000 N-Power beneficiaries.\nHe explained: “While each of the beneficiaries after being verified would select their choice of device amongst nine different BOI pre-approved vendors, the price ranges from N3,000 to N6,700 monthly deductions for the next 20months.\n“Therefore in some cases the N4,500 device grant would cover the full monthly deduction cost while in other cases the graduate authorizes BOI to deduct the additional differential cost from their monthly stipends depending on the device chosen.”\nThe Vice President’s Spokesman also noted that “6 of the 9 BOI pre-approved vendors are indigenous local brands in pursuit of the Buhari administration’s push for Local Content.”\nHe said “almost 100,000 graduate N-Power beneficiaries have completed their orders for the devices, adding that the Bank of Industry is in charge of affecting the orders made. The plan is to conduct the order of the devices in two batches of 100,000 each, one after the other.\n“It was further disclosed that all the 149,669 N-Power beneficiaries now collecting their stipends have been physically verified and deployed, while their given bank account information have also been matched with the Bank Verification Number.”\nThe SSA said that “in December, about 112,475 of the N-Power graduate beneficiaries received the N30,000 monthly stipends, and the number came close to 150,000, both in January and February meaning about that number are now receiving their up-to-date stipends from the N-Power Volunteer Corps.”\nAkande also noted “that now beneficiaries across the 36 States of the Federation, and the FCT have been verified, totaling the 150,000 figure. He said the balance 50,000 of the 200,000 beneficiaries engaged by the FG are those who so far could not be paid for various reasons.\n“This includes those who were disqualified during verification on the basis of age-over 35, and inadequate academic qualification.

There are also those who used different names and differing personal information. And lastly there are also those whose banking information simply do not match with their BVN banking records.\nIn the case of those whose marital status have changed, Akande explained that their information is now being updated through the various States and FCT Focal Persons and then they would be represented for payment.\nHe also disclosed that those who have sought redeployment to other states are among the 50,000 and in such cases, they will be considered alongside those to be replaced from the N-Power waiting list where necessary.\n“The process for the replacement of those who did not show up and those disqualified would also resume shortly to bring the number back to 200,000 for the first batch of the 500,000 promised by the Buhari administration”, he said.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"http://www.vanguardngr.com/2017/03/n-power-graduates-get-additional-n4500-subsidy-buy-tablets/","2":"901","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999885559"},{"0":"Mallam Nasir Ahmed El-Rufai, described his encounter with the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, as nice\nBy Jide Ajani, Emma Ujah & Henry Umoru –\nFormer Minister of Federal Capital Territory, FCT, and chieftain of Congress for Progressive Change, CPC, Mallam Nasir el-Rufai, has been arrested by the State Security Service, SSS over alleged “inciting, inflammatory and grossly misleading” claims.\nel-Rufai was arrested in the early hours of yesterday at the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja, on arrival from the United Kingdom, UK.\nHe was said to have returned from a trip undertaken with the CPC presidential candidate in the April polls, Maj. General Muhammad Buhari, and his running mate, Pastor Tunde Bakare, who were at the Chattam House in London, to make a formal presentation about the polls which result they have rejected and are contesting at the presidential election tribunal.\nel-Rufai has, of recent, become very critical of the Federal Government.\nIn a statement, the SSS linked the arrest to “recent articles in the cyber and print media which have been considered by well-meaning Nigerians to be inciting, inflammatory and grossly misleading”. El-Rufai’s media aide corroborated the claim when he hinted that his principal may have been held over his allegation in the media that the Office of the National Security Adviser (NSA) was allocated N208 billion in the 2011 budget.\nSunday Vanguard security sources, however, punctured the former minister’s allegation on the N208 billion budgetary allocation to the NSA office, saying it was a lie. The sources said el-Rufai had explanations to make on the matter. It was gathered that the former minister may be charged to court tomorrow. It was not clear what he may be charged with, although a source said he may face incitement charge.\nBuhari was swift in his condemnation of the arrest which he described as a flagrant violation of the former minister’s right and demanded his release.\nFormer Minister of Aviation, Chief Femi Fani-Kayode, also described el-Rufai’s arrest as “a disgrace and monumental error” on the part of the Federal Government.\nWhy he was arrested – SSS\nIn a statement by the SSS, signed by Marilyn Ogar, Assistant Director, Public Relations, it was discovered that the operatives who arrested el-Rufai were acting on instructions.\nThe statement read:\n“At 0500 hours of 2nd July, 2011, Mallam Nasiru el-Rufai, the former Minister of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), was intercepted on arrival at the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja.\n“This became necessary following Mallam el-Rufai’s recent articles in the cyber and print media which have been considered by well meaning Nigerians to be inciting, inflammatory and grossly misleading. For instance, his column on the back page of 1st July, 2011 edition of Thisday newspaper titled “What Nigeria Pays FG” clearly attests to this.\n“It is pertinent to note that the Freedom of Information Bill (FOI Bill has been passed into law, yet he refused to cross check his facts before publishing. He rather chose to misinform the public with mischievously orchestrated data with the intent of causing disaffection among the populace thereby subverting Government.\n“It is expected that the Former Minister should have been more circumspect against the backdrop of current security challenges in the country.\n“Nigeria belongs to all of us and no one should take laws into their hands as no one is above the law”.\nHow they held el-Rufai – aide\nDetailing how the former minister was arrested, his media aide, Muyiwa Adekeye, in a statement, said el-Rufai was, yesterday morning, arrested at Abuja airport as he arrived from London aboard a British Airways flight. SSS operatives later whisked him to their headquarters where he was hauled before their Director-General, the statement.\nAccording to the statement, ‘’feelers indicate that the immediate trigger for his arrest is his disclosure in his Thisday column of Friday, 01 July 2011 that the National Security Adviser (NSA) was allocated N208 billion in the 2011 budget. This figure is in the 2011 Appropriation Act which is a public document.\n“Bringing an information in the public domain to the people cannot by any stretch of the imagination be a crime even if it embarrasses security chiefs who, on the evidence of insecurity in the land, are not delivering value despite securing tidy budgetary allocations!\n“If the facts in el Rufai’s article, ‘What Nigerians pay FG’, are wrong in fact or context, that cannot be remedied by a denial of liberty. The government should simply publish its alternative narrative, and let the public decide. All efforts to establish contact with him have since proved abortive and the SSS has given no word to his family and lawyers who have kept vigil.\n“el Rufai was returning from a week-long trip to the UK where he attended the Chatham House presentation by General Muhammadu Buhari, the presidential candidate of the CPC, who discussed recent events in Nigeria. He also visited his kids schooling there.\n“Mallam el Rufai has not done anything illegal by encouraging discourse about what our government costs us. He has been outspoken about his concerns regarding the direction the current government is taking this country, and he has written critical pieces on this matter on Nigerian and international media platforms. Free speech is a constitutional right, and it implies the obligation by the state to defend even those whose views are not congruent with the powers that be.\n“el Rufai’s views have been opposed by commentators more sympathetic to the Jonathan government. That is the way civilized discourse ought to go in a democratic country, not an illegal resort to arm-twisting and harassment.”\nel-Rufai’s SMS message made available to our correspondent immediately he was picked read, “good morning. I have been detained at the airport on arrival by the SSS. Thanks.’’\nCase to answer\nBut giving some insight into the reason el-Rufai was arrested, a top placed security source told Sunday Vanguard: “We picked him up because he wrote (alleged) lies”. He went on: “In the Appropriation (Amendment) Bill 2011 passed by both the Senate and the House of Representatives on May 25 and signed into law by President Goodluck Jonathan on May 26, 2011, the intelligence community got a total allocation of N109,855,099,466 (approximated to N109.855bilion) which splits as follows: the Office of the National Security Adviser – N40,846,937,023; Directorate of State Security (that is the SSS) – N23,452,705,993; National Intelligence Agency – N27,720,580,338; and the Presidential Air Fleet –N17,834,876,113. So where did El-Rufai get his N208billion? Even then, all the funds due to intelligence community are controlled by the Permanent Secretary (Social Services) in the Office of the Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF)”.\nThe source further said: “When did Amnesty Programme become part of intelligence community whose votes are being managed by the National Security Adviser? It is very wrong and inciting to manufacture figures and present them as truth because you lost out somewhere and suddenly realised you should become relevant by writing a column in a newspaper. He is certainly appearing in court on Monday.”\nViolation of right\nMeanwhile, Buhari says the arrest is a flagrant violation of el-Rufai’s right.\nThe former head of state and the presidential candidate of the former minister’s party, the CPC, in the April polls, who also called for el-Rufai’s immediate release, said, “It only shows that there are more people in our country who know how to win by hook and crook than those who know how to make proper use of their victory.”\nIn a statement signed yesterday by his spokesperson, Yinka Odumakin, Buhari noted that rather than what he termed unjust incarceration of the former minister, government should instead proceed to prefer whatever charges they have against him in court if he has committed any offense known to the laws of the land.\n“But to keep him in gaol without any charges will only cast the administration in the mould of a vindictive regime that is launching a wave of political repression because it is jittery”, he said.\nAccording to the statement, Buhari, who condemned what he described as this brazen act of intimidation,harassment and flagrant violation of citizens right in a democratic atmosphere, said ‘’that hounding innocent citizens to detention in less than a month in office while failing to rise to the security challenges facing the nation shows a regime that does not understand what its priorities should be.’’\nFani-Kayode, also querying el-Rufai’s arrest, said, “Since when has it been a crime to be critical of government?”, adding, “I thought this was meant to be a democracy. Those who speak out are not the ones President Jonathan should be worried about.\n“It is those that do not speak out but that bomb, maim and kill that his SSS should be hunting down.”\nThe former aviation minister told Sunday Vanguard that the Jonathan administration cannot silence opposition as, according to him, to use force and intimidation against opposition would only multiply it.\nHe therefore called for the immediate release of the CPC chieftain.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"http://www.vanguardngr.com/2011/07/sss-arrests-el-rufai-over-incitement/","2":"2127","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.999994278"},{"0":"Prince Bisi Yusuff, the Chairman of Ayobo-Ipaja Local Council Development Area and the Action CongressÂ of Nigeria, ACN, candidate for the Alimosho constituency 01 in the Lagos State House of Assembly, inÂ this interview with Political Platforms, speaks on his ambition and other issues.\nWhy are you vying for the State Assembly seat?\nWell, I am contesting because that is the wish of my people.Â My people demanded that I contestÂ because they believe in my ability and the fact that I will give them quality representation.\nYou are moving from the executive post to the legislature.

For instance, in the area of infrastructuralÂ development, Alimosho is bigger than so many states in the federation and therefore, my focus willÂ definitely be on that.\nIn terms of road development, we are lagging behind; this area is going to be my number one priorityÂ because Ipaja-Ayobo has not witnessed much in terms of infrastructural development in the last coupleÂ of years, likewise Agbado Oke-Odo and Mosan Okunola and Alimosho Federal Constituency.\nGovernor Fashola has embarked on a project inÂ Alimosho as a mega/model city and we in the House ofÂ Assembly would try as much as possible to encourage him to quicken action on it. If we could achieveÂ this aim, Alimosho willÂ become a centre of excellence in the centre of excellence.\nHow soon should the people of Ayobo-Ipaja be expecting their roads to be motorable?\nAlready it is done. You can see that we now have about 10 BRT buses plying our roads. So, theÂ palliative measure has started and the governor has awarded the contract. It is going to be aÂ dual-carriage road from Moshalasi to Aiyetoro.\nIt will commence very soon after the completion of Egbe-Idimu/Iyana-Ipaja Road, and it will then beÂ our turn but I just have to appeal to my people to exercise some patient. Now that I am going to aÂ higher level, definitely, there will be a lot of improvement.\nHow did the voter registration fare in your area?\nWhen you see a good product, the people will rush it. It is the work that governor Fashola has doneÂ with the little ones that I put up, that made the people to come out en masse to participate in theÂ exercise but unfortunately, we could not register all eligible voters because of inadequate DDCÂ machines. IfÂ the DDC machines were enough, we would have registered over one million would-be votersÂ in this LCDA.\nNow that the registration exercise has ended, what machinery have you put in place to ensure theÂ success of ACN in your domain?\nBy the special grace of God, we have started. You can see the kind of jamboree that Jonathan isÂ putting up. Ours is more than that. This campaign is more than gathering, singing and dancing. What weÂ are going to tell the people is just the issue.\nThe issues that affect the ordinary people on the street, the issues that will alleviate theirÂ sufferings. The issues that will put food on their table, giveÂ them electricity, good road network,Â transportation, education and water; the issue that will affect the social life of the people and howÂ to reduce social problems in our society.\nWe will engage in debate with those who want to contest against us.Â Let us have an open debate, letÂ us invite them so that they can engage us in a debate on what we want to do for our people. This areÂ the issuesÂ we want to tackle because this campaign is gong to be scientific.","1":"https://pmnewsnigeria.com/2013/09/26/divided-anambra-gov-obis-legacy/We","2":"1076","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999961853"},{"0":"A Professor of Entomology at the University of Ilorin, Adeolu Ande, has decried killing mosquitoes, saying the insects are friends to humans that deserved to be properly managed.\nAnde said that mosquitoes had proven over the years that they are our friends and allies, adding that if we like them or not, they would exist and continue to source blood from humans.\nHe also said that zoologists were expected to be the foster parents of animals in the Zoo, adding that they should be familiar with their needs and their health status.\nAnde made the statement on Monday in Ilorin in a paper he presented at a public seminar organised by the university.\nIn his paper with the title “Consider the ways of Ants and be Wise,” the entomologist described insects as the “most successful and influential group’’ of organisms in the biosphere.\nHe said that humans had a lot to learn from insects in order to be wise.\n“Human life is beset with inevitable associations with insects that have over the years influenced human destiny positively and negatively.\n“Negative influences, such as disease transmission, crop losses, food spoilage, economic losses and nuisance value caused by less than 5 per cent of insect species have been exaggerated by man.\nHe said that positive influences of insects are not unappreciated and downplayed.\nHe listed some of them to include: pollination of flowers, waste recycling and sustenance of the ecosystem.\nOthers, he said, include source of silk, shellac, cochineal, therapeutic agents, aesthetics, biological control agents and food source.\nThe don said that man deliberately misunderstood the role of mosquitoes and frequently described them as causing the diseases they transmit.\nHe said: “in the actual sense, mosquitoes are equally sick but inadvertently and unwillingly convey pathogens that are the real causal agents of these diseases.\n“The female mosquito could be described as an example of a true mother who is forced to undertake suicide mission in its bid to provide for its unborn children.\n“The adult female mosquitoes have exceptional value for child raising hence the level of commitment and risk they take on the mission that entails decision between life and death.\n“The after effect of this commitment is a well thought out plan that forestalls most of the factors that may stand in the way of raising good children.\n“I am sure most human females will not take comparable decision in the face of similar attendant risks.\n“It is however certain that children born after well thought-out and risky conditions are better posited for quality living than those produced carelessly.\nThe professor called for improvement in Zoology curriculum to ensure better focus on organisms that feature prominently around man.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"https://www.google.com.ng/amp/www.vanguardngr.com/2017/06/mosquitoes-friends-need-blood-stop-killing-don/amp/","2":"589","3":"Health","4":"2","5":"en","6":"0.9999809265"},{"0":"By Is’haq Modibbo Kawu\nNOVEMBER 15th, marked the ninth anniversary of the passing of Rear Admiral Muhammed Alabi Lawal, naval officer, former Ogun state military administrator and first democratically elected indigene of Ilorin as civilian governor of Kwara state. To commemorate the anniversary, a prayer session held in his residence in Ilorin, while his political associates used the opportunity to recall his contributions to Kwara’s development. I was unable to attend ceremonies to commemorate his death.\nI had a very difficult relationship with Governor Muhammed Lawal. There was really nothing personal between us, but by proxy, we became enstranged, as a result of issues and individuals within his administration. Those directly concerned did everything to set Muhammed Lawal against me, and I must openly declare today, that it was testimony to his character, that he did not go as far as they wanted, in the manner that I decided to end my tenure as General Manager of the Kwara State Television Service.\nI met Governor Lawal alone in his office inside the Government House, Ilorin, on May 7TH, 2002, to submit a letter of resignation; we then spent the next one hour and a half hours discussing all the issues that were crafted as political allegations against me as well as my honest view of his performance as governor that he insisted that I offered.\n“You’re a journalist and Political Scientist”, he had reminded me, “please tell me the truth”! I resumed as Editor of DAILY TRUST the following week, and in February, 2003, I met Governor Muhammed Lawal again, in Ilorin, this time at the behest of General Ibrahim Babangida, who insisted on the meeting, so we can settle whatever differences we had. That meeting held before the 2003 elections and the backdrop was the deep political division, which had developed in the Ilorin Emirate, and the feeling that Governor Muhammed Lawal had designs against the Emir of Ilorin and the Emirate structure. Dr. Olushola Saraki postured as defender of our community’s values; therefore, a tactical alliance was built against Governor Muhammed Lawal.\nThe late Olushola Saraki exploited our feelings and manipulated emotions about our historical values to open access for his son, Bukola, to seize the reigns of power and unfortunately, we couldn’t foresee that we were embarking on a journey to perdition. The Saraki hegemony has turned out to be the worst plague that our community has ever or can ever suffer! But that is a different issue to interrogate at another point in time.\nAfter Governor Muhammed Lawal’s defeat in the 2003 elections, I won’t get to meet the man again, until April 2004, in Sokoto and later on in Abuja. That last meeting in Abuja held for a very long time and we discussed in some detail, many of the issues that haunted his administration and led to his alienation from the community.\nI left Muhammed Lawal that day, a bit more sympathetic towards him, even when I was still caught up in the sweep of the emotions of the events, which led to his defeat at the elections. Not long after our last meeting, his mother died in Ilorin. I went to greet him but did not meet him, I however left a very long note. We were not destined to meet again, till he died in 2006. I wrote an obituary which some of his supporters were not happy about. And when I attended a wedding ceremony in his mosque a year or so after, a member of his family even attempted to assault me as we filed out of the mosque!\nIt was indicative of the deep emotions that the late Governor Muhammed Lawal continued to stir in our community. But I think nine years after his death, and with the experience of the Saraki hegemony in Kwara since 2003, there has come a newer understanding of the Governor Muhammed Lawal’s years in our state as well as a greater appreciation of the man himself.\nThe late Governor Muhammed Lawal belonged to that generation of Ilorin elite born during the 1940s; they were the first set that really had university education and therefore were the link between the older generation and the much younger. They helped the community to finally appreciate the importance of tertiary education.\nThat generation was also unique, because many of them were outstanding students and Muhammed Lawal was also one of the best of his generation. They went into professions and would be outstanding in their various fields. Muhammed Lawal studied engineering at the Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria, before joining the Nigerian Navy, where he rose to become an admiral. When he retired, it came as no surprise that he would join politics; and it was also remarkable that he became civilian governor at a point when the Ilorin community had reached a consensus, that one of its children should become governor, for the first time since the creation of Kwara state in 1967.\nMuhammed Lawal took to the job like a duck to water and made tremendous effort at rehabilitating many projects that had decayed over the decades of military dictatorship. He went on a roads rehabilitation and construction spree; health centres were rehabilitated; a new presidential lodge was constructed and Muhammed Lawal renovated Kwara Hotel and government quarters all over the GRA were given a facelift. Above all, he consciously chose to empower local contractors and so a lot of money circulated within the economy of the state.\nRemarkably, Muhammed Lawal did not choose to sell off state assets as Bukola Saraki was eventually to do when he became governor and he didn’t prioritise non-Kwara contractors as Bukola Saraki was to do, in a conscious effort to impoverish the community, as a weapon of control. And because Muhammed Lawal was a bonafide son of our community, he readily showed respect for our culture and our people.\nWhether at wedding ceremonies or funeral prayers, Muhammed Lawal knew the values that our people valorised. On the contrary, when Bukola Saraki became governor, his arrogance became the talk of the community. He looked down at people, including the elders of our community, and carried on as if he was doing a favour being governor of Kwara state.\nSecond term politics\nUnfortunately, the politics of Second Term in power distracted Governor Muhammed Lawal. Unbeknownst to all, late Olushola Saraki had decided that his son, who was alien to the community, was ready to become governor. He postured as defender of the values of the community at a time that Muhammed Lawal was increasingly becoming profiled as antagonistic to the Emir of Ilorin and the structures of value of the community. It was a battle that he could not win, since the Saraki family had entered the ruling PDP; federal might was called upon, after then Vice President, Atiku Abubakar had imposed Bukola Saraki as PDP’s governorship candidate, despite protestations of original members of the party in the state.\nMuhammed Lawal was defeated in the 2003 elections, and people in our community and state rejoiced. What we could not foresee in 2003, was that we were about to enter into the worst possible period in our history.\nThe Saraki hegemony was finally instituted and the control of Kwara’s finances since 2003, led to the entrenchment of Bukola Saraki’s personality cult. He defeated his father and sister in the 2011 elections and installed as governor a long-term loyalist, AbdulFatai Ahmed. With that action, the most unique political project was foisted on Kwara state, which has no parallel in Nigeria-genuinely ruling a state by proxy!\nThere is no gainsaying the fact that the twelve years since 2003, has been the worst in the history of Kwara state. The steady impoverishment of our people has gone side-by-side with the jaw-dropping enrichment of Bukola Saraki and the coterie of political hangers on around him. Today teachers, local government staff and workers in parastatals are owed salaries.\nThe huge sums that Kwara took from the Federation Account along with the massive loans taken in our name over the past twelve years, cannot be seen in meaningful developments genuinely touching the lives of our people. Governance in Kwara since 2003 resembles an elaborate project of deceit and patent fraud. It is like entering a “One Chance Taxi”, and in the name of Public-Private-Partnerships (PPP), Kwara state has been systematically fleeced while its resources resembles a lady that fell into the hands of serial rapists. This is the lie that governance has desperately continued to attempt to hide since 2003 and it’s the reason that Kwara state lies prostrate. Our people are in acute despair because governance is a fraud, which does not touch their lives positively.\nGiven the pains they have gone through since 2003 with the institution of the Saraki hegemony and the enthronement of Bukola Saraki’s personality cult, it is no wonder that people are reappraising the Muhammed Lawal legacy in Ilorin in particular and Kwara state in general. There were many things that people disagreed with during his administration; they included the employment of thugs and cultists who visited violence on the community. His commissioner son-in-law also alienated people. They were also unable to tolerate his disrespect of the emirate structure and they expressed their displeasure through the ballot box.\nHowever, in the years since he left power, and following his tragic death, we now know better, who was really a genuine lover of our community and its ethos. Muhammed Lawal worked devotedly as governor and he never attempted to alienate the properties of government, nor sold them to cronies. He did not take loans in the name of Kwara, nor use the loans to build shopping complexes, diagnostic centre or aviation college; he did not appropriate hundreds of millions of naira for a so-called Zimbabwe farm, then turn around to say those projects do not belong to our state, but to a so-called “Private Sector”. That was the governance gimmick introduced to Kwara state by Bukola Saraki.\nMuhammed Lawal was a genuine patriot who loved our community and worked for its genuine development and the empowerment of our people. He did not manipulate the House of Assembly to approve for himself an immoral pension package and did not treat Kwara as a private estate. That came after he left power and the state became the hegemony of a single family and eventually the wallet of an individual. This is the background today, why the late Governor Muhammed Lawal is now fondly remembered in Kwara state. May Allah forgive Governor Muhammed Lawal and grant him Aljanna. Amin.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"http://www.vanguardngr.com/2015/12/remembering-governor-muhammed-lawal/","2":"2314","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999904633"},{"0":"BREAKING: Why we accepted N70,000 minimum wage – Labour\nThe leaders of the Nigerian Labour Congress (NLC) and Trade Union Congress (TUC) announced that they have accepted the N70,000 minimum wage approved for Nigerian workers by President Bola Tinubu.\nA statement by Bayo Onanuga, the Special Adviser to President Bola Tinubu on Information and Strategy, indicated that President Tinubu also pledged to find ways to help the private sector and sub-national entities meet the minimum wage requirement.\nFollowing the meeting, the President of the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), Comrade Joe Ajaero, briefed the media and confirmed that the unions had accepted the offer.\nRead Also: My new album is a labour of love, says Simi\nAjaero, accompanied by Comrade Festus Usifo, President of the Trade Union Congress (TUC), and other representatives of Nigerian workers, stated that the unions had accepted the offer because there were other incentives attached.\nHe said that the president’s pledge of a review every three years, as opposed to what had previously been received, was another factor in his decision to accept the offer.","1":"https://thenationonlineng.net/breaking-why-we-accepted-n70000-minimum-wage-labour/?utm_source=&utm_medium=twitterThose","2":"246","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9998130798"},{"0":"Pope Francis has outlawed the sale of cigarettes at the Vatican in a bid to lead by example on healthy living.\n“The Holy Father has decided that the Vatican will cease to sell cigarettes to employees as of 2018,” the Vatican said in a statement on Thursday.\n“The reason is very simple: the Holy See cannot contribute to an activity that clearly damages the health of people,” it said, adding that smoking claims more than seven million lives every year, according to the World Health Organization.\n“Although the cigarettes sold to employees and pensioners in the Vatican at a reduced price are a source of revenue for the Holy See, no profit can be legitimate if it puts lives at risk,” it added.\nFrancis, who has only one lung, does not smoke.

According to sources, the management borrowed from a bank to pay last month.\nThe salary issue is just one of the many problems facing the National Assembly.\nThe one that is biting the lawmakers most is the inability of the management to pay their usual quarterly allocation, which should have been paid in January.\nTheir displeasure over the non-payment of the allocation stem from the obvious fact that most of them were banking on it to fund the final phases of their election campaigns, leaving many to think that perhaps the executive deliberately withheld their funds as a punitive measure.\nIt was learnt that late last year and also early in January, the leadership of the National Assembly met with the Minister of Finance, Dr. Ngozi Okonjo-Iwela, to resolve the financial crisis.\nWhile not admitting that the nation was broke as was variously insinuated, the minister was said to have told her guests that her office would release only half of their quarterly allocation.\nThe National Assembly’s leadership, according to a source who was part of the meeting, but would not want to be named, turned down the offer, insisting that since the money had been appropriated and the minister claimed the nation was not broke, all and not part of the money should be released. This meeting took place at the Presidential Villa.\nBy the time the National Assembly’s leadership met with the Minister again last January, both parties finally agreed that the quarterly allocation would be paid in three installments, beginning from January.\nThis plan has been disrupted by the ministry, which paid only the January installment. Both the February and March payments that would have completed the agreed three installments are still pending.\nThis situation, according to insiders, has put many of the legislators in a precarious position as some of them are finding it difficult to meet up with commitments with banks where they have taken loans.\nA source said the morale of most of the employees of the National Assembly Service Commission is at its lowest ebb with many of them struggling to transport themselves to work, their woes compounded by the recent fuel scarcity in Abuja.\nThe financial crisis in the Assembly has also brought about frequent power outages. Electricity bills and others, such as Internet, maintenance and other sundry bills are said to be over N1 billion, leaving the service providers with no option, but to disrupt services.\nConstruction giant Julius Berger recently pulled out of the maintenance arrangement it had with the Assembly.

The test result showed that one of the affected banks had CAR of 1.29 per cent before the test, while two banks had 0.78 per cent and 8.2 per cent after the test.\nThe stress test captured the idiosyncratic nature of individual bank’s balance sheet and macro-prudential concerns, using the bottom-up and top-down approaches. The exercise covered the 23 commercial and merchant banks, using the credit, liquidity, interest, foreign exchange rates and foreign exchange trading risks elements.\nThe report, which measured the lenders’ positions as at December last year, showed that overall, there was high risk through unsecured interbank exposure.\nThe result of the test also revealed that after a one-day run, the liquidity ratio for the industry would decline to 33.4 per cent from the 48.57 per cent pre-shock position and to 10.24 per cent after a cumulative 30-day run. A five-day and cumulative 30-day run on the banking industry would result in a liquidity shortfall of N1.79 trillion and N1.93 trillion, respectively.\nThe test further revealed that 17 and 20 banks would record liquidity ratios below the prudential threshold of 30 per cent, following the five-day and cumulative 30-day run, respectively.\nThere was a marginal decline in the quality of assets in the banking industry last December, compared with the position at end of June 2015. The ratio of non-performing loans to gross loans increased by 0.21 percentage point to 4.86 per cent while the decline in asset quality was attributed to the unfavourable macro-economic environment in the review period.\nThe banking industry and large banks’ resilience to credit risk was robust. A simulated severe shock of a 200 per cent rise in NPLs resulted in CARs of 12.77 and 16.52 per cent for banking industry and large banks, respectively, which were above the 10 per cent required regulatory minimum.\nHowever, medium and small bank groups showed vulnerabilities to severe shocks of 200 per cent rise in NPLs as their CARs fell to 7.16 and 6.85 per cent respectively.\nEmefiele said the general decline in commodity prices, China’s efforts at rebalancing its economy and the gradual tightening in US monetary policy all combined to hamper growth in many emerging market economies, including Nigeria.\nHe said the key task that faced monetary authorities in Nigeria in the reporting period centered on the use of effective policy tools to ensure that the shocks arising from instability in the global economy were not fully transmitted to the domestic economy.\nThe CBN, he said, continued to ensure that the stability of the financial system was maintained and confidence in the system was sustained. The policy tool kit included both conventional and unconventional measures and these enabled us to respond to the emerging challenges.","1":"http://thenationonlineng.net/cbns-stress-test-shows-two-banks-trouble/","2":"775","3":"Business","4":"2","5":"en","6":"0.9999256134"},{"0":"BolaZambia.com sets your business apart with its memorable and descriptive name, reflecting the rich heritage of Zambia.

It is pertinent to state that I am quite hale and hearty without any injury or harm.\n“More so, it is important to state for the records the actual facts as regards the events that occurred that fateful, Sunday afternoon of 21st July, 2019 in order to clarify the narrative trailing the publications.\n“It is quite true that I was in Akure, Ondo State from Friday, 19th July, 2019 to Sunday, 22nd July, 2019 for my mother’s investiture as the Iya-Ijo (Chief Matron) of our home Church, Christ Anglican Church, Oke-Ifira-Akoko, Ondo State.\n“ On my way back to Abuja on the 22nd day of July, 2019 in the company of some security men, we saw two men at the highway around Akoko, Ondo State carrying dane guns.\n“On sighting them, inquiry was made as to their duty on the highway with guns in their hands, being not uniformed men. They thereafter responded that they were members of the Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Vigilante group whose operation is known to all the security apparatus in the area.\n“Also, they willingly showed us their identity cards which had their names and designations. Some other security men came to corroborate their claims.\n“I therefore wish to debunk the account that I was stopped by Fulani Herdsmen as peddled by some persons.\n“Our interaction is a voluntary undertaking as part of my profiling as a discerning leader of my community, desirous of curbing the menace of insecurity in Nigeria.”\nAjulo cautioned Nigerians against turning the insecurity in the country to political and ethnic sentiments,\nHe added: “In response to the controversial reactions on my encounter with these men, it suffices to state that we as Nigerians, must sever political and ethnic sentiments from our minds in the bid to nip this ubiquitous insecurity in the land in the bud.\n“In my comment on the gruesome killing of Pa. Fasoranti’s daughter, and a confidant, I categorically and unapologetically hinted that we should not see the killing as inter-ethnic attack as there are reported cases of massive killings in other parts of the Country.\n“Recently, about 32 persons were killed in Sokoto State, several others killed in Kaduna, Benue, Niger, Zamfara and other States by some undisclosed bandits, who to me irrespective of their ethnic background are criminal and must be treated as such.\n“The naked truth is that the insecurity in Nigeria is national which must not be ignored and we must join hands with our security agencies to fight the menace.\n“Thus, we should not allow ethnicity and sentiment to becloud our sense of judgment and humanity in the war against insecurity.”\nHe said if Nigerians, especially public commentators, were not cautious, the increasing bigotry in the country might lead to civil war.\nHe said: “We are at a time in our nation that pretentious and sentimental interactions no longer works otherwise this bigotry may fan into flame the embers of civil war in this country.\n“It will not be out of place to ask this poser: is it due to the lackadaisical attitude of the Law enforcement agencies and disregards for the inputs and indelible contributions of our leaders, the OPC and other local vigilante groups that these Miyetti Allah groups are now manning our highways in the South West?\n“This is the question that must be addressed by all stakeholders regardless of their ethnic, religious and political affiliations.\n“As I thank all for their concern, may I conclude with the words of the legendry Late Justice Chukwudifu Oputa JSC (as he then was) that “when we act in unison, we will achieve the peace that we search, but when we are fighting separately, it is not coordinate and if we don’t accommodate one another, we cannot live together”.","1":"https://thenationonlineng.net/breaking-i-was-not-ambushed-by-herdsmen-says-kayode-ajulo/","2":"1138","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999885559"},{"0":"Militants during the submission of arms and ammunitions in Ondo\nBy Chris Ochayi\nABUJA – Ex-agitators benefiting from the Federal Government’s amnesty programme have been advised to avoid any acts capable of jeopardising the relative peace currently being experienced in the Niger Delta region with a view to encouraging investors to flock the region.\nThe Chairman of Coalition of Niger Delta Ex-Agitators, Comrade Stephen Ebisintei, who gave the advice, while speaking with newsmen in Abuja, further counsel led any ex-agitations nursing whatever grievances to channel such complaint through the amnesty office.\nEbisintei urged to youths in the Niger Delta region to take advantage of open door policy of the current Chairman of the Federal Government’s Amnesty Programme, Professor Quaker Dokubo to air their views positively in a way that will hearten growth and development of the region.\nEbisintei, who is the beneficiary of Phase 2 of the amnesty program described Prof Dokubo as a round peg in a round hole who according to him “has brought unquestionable experience as a technocrat and proven integrity to the job.”\nHe said the youth centred policies of Amnesty Office under Prof Dokubo are already yielding short term benefits to targeted beneficiaries and have restored confidence and improved between relationship between the Amnesty Office and the critical stakeholders in the region.\nThe chairman further advised the youths of the region to shun any acts capable of rolling back the progress made so far by the President Buhari administration in restoring peace to the region.\nAccording to him, “The time has come for youth leaders across the nine states of the Niger Delta region and indeed other critical stakeholders to support the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari in his clear resolve to bring development to the region given his robust support to the Ministry of Niger Delta Affairs, NIMASA, NDDC and the Amnesty Office.\n“The support is targeted at development, security and empowerment of the people of the region.\n“The youths should therefore shun acts that are capable of endangering their lives and jeopardizing the security of the region, which in turn discourages investors from the region. Our youths should see the office of the Special Adviser to President on Niger Delta as not just for ex-agitators alone, but for every youth, women and all critical stakeholders in the region.”\nEbisintei, explained to the amnesty beneficiaries that there was no housing allowance included in the stipends paid to them as being demanded, rather it used to be what he called ‘transition safety allowance’, which according to him “is a one-off money paid at the beginning of each phase of the program.\n“Phase 1 received the money, Phase 2 received it and Phase 3 the same. However, if the ex-agitators want a housing allowance included, it should be done through the proper channel.

He also hardly lays assists. And yet, his coach Stephen Keshi has backed the under-fire forward to come good once he sheds his anxiety.\nThe forward scored once at the African Nations Cup and only once more since then; a penalty conversion against Mexico in a 2-2 friendly draw.\nAnd at the Confederations Cup he was guilty of squandering a host of gilt-edged chances as he failed to find the back of the net.\nBut his endeavour, hard work, link-\nup play have found favour with his coach.\n“Yeah, it’s true that Brown hasn’t scored goals, but that does not make him a bad player,” Keshi tells KickOffNigeria.com. “Sometimes when the ambition [to score] turns into anxiety, it becomes difficult for a striker to score goals.\n“So all he needs to do is relax. We have been working on his inner relaxation and inner calm so that when he is in front of goal it will be much easier for him.”\nKeshi praised Ideye’s other qualities, especially his unselfish graft for the team.

If we agree that infrastructure is the driver of growth, when you get high oil prices, what do you do with it? So, where are those towers, where are those bridges, where are those highways?\nThe only part of the above statement that is true is the part where Mr. Fashola says “I don’t think”. Yes sir, you do not think. Because if you did you would know that the oil and gas industry, by the admission of even Mr. Fashola’s boss, President Buhari, is only 15% of Nigeria’s GDP. This fact which is well known to Mr. Fashola is also corroborated by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.\nSo yes, high oil prices would have a positive impact on the Nigerian economy but it cannot be the sole reason why we enjoyed 7% GDP growth under President Jonathan.\nAfter all during former President Olusegun Obasanjo’s eight years in office oil price was very low and were below $20 for a while yet that Peoples Democratic Party government did not deliver excuses, instead, they delivered consistent annual 5% GDP growth.\nGoing by Mr. Fashola’s logic, the present administration which is enjoying an oil price that is presently $45 per barrel ought to at least match President Obasanjo’s record. But here we are, at a recession.\nYou, see, the truth is that no matter how high oil prices are, if you do not have sound economic policies, you cannot have economic progression.\nSo what are the economic policies of the Jonathan era that drove Nigeria’s massive 7% GDP growth year in year out while Jonathan was on the saddle?\nWhat is beneath the ground cannot make a nation great. The only way a nation can be great is by what is between the ears of her people. Educating the citizenry is the fastest way to achieve economic growth because education makes you GROW through life while illiteracy makes you GO through life.\nPresident Jonathan began the practice of giving education the highest sectoral allocation in the budget.\nIn the 2011 budget, N306.3 billion was allocated to education, in 2012 N400.15 billion, in 2013 N426.53 billion, in 2014, N493.2 billion and in 2015 N492. 34 billion was allocated for education.\nNever in the history of Nigeria has any government consistently shown such commitment to education.\nSuch was President Jonathan’s commitment to education that even though primary and secondary education is the preserve of the states, the federal government intervened to reduce the 10 million children out of school in Northern Nigeria by building 165 brand new almajiri schools.\nBy building 12 new federal universities and 165 almajiri schools and renovating 507 additional secondary schools all over Nigeria through the Universal Basic Education Commission, the Jonathan administration not only increased access to education, the policy also had the intended side effect of putting hundreds of thousands of youths to work which stimulated the economy and contributed to GDP growth.\nAnother policy of the Jonathan administration that added to GDP growth was his deliberate effort to expand access to opportunity through the YouWIN program. The Youth Enterprise with Innovation in Nigeria (YOUWIN) scheme was a business plan competition that provided training and funding of between $6000-$80,000 to youths to start or grow existing small, medium and even large scale businesses with the proviso that beneficiaries were to compulsorily employ other youths.\nMr. Fashola may also want to have a chat with the GIS Project Director in the Ministry of Finance, Mr. Dennis Chukwu, who revealed in Lokoja, Kogi State, on the 5th of September, 2016 during the Career Development and Entrepreneurship Skills Training for beneficiaries of the Graduate Internship Scheme that the GIS scheme had benefited a total of 41,000 Nigerian graduates during the Jonathan administration by giving them the opportunity to earn experience and money that put them in good stead to either start their own businesses or get employed at a level that they would not have been qualified for had they not had the opportunity provided by the GIS.\nIn 2010 President Jonathan Promised to Revive Nigeria’s Railways. By 2012 The Nigerian Railways Corporation began operating a Lagos to Kano service at the cost of just ₦1500. In 2013 rail lines were revived from Lagos Port Direct to Kaduna. By 2014, the Enugu-Port Harcourt lines were revived along with several others including the Makurdi-Port Harcourt rail.\nBy 2015, the Abuja-Kaduna rail which was recently commissioned by President Buhari was completed BY THE JONATHAN ADMINISTRATION!\nNot only did work on these projects provide jobs to tens of thousands of Nigerians, by the time they were finished these rail lines eased transportation of goods and services all over Nigeria.\nMr. Fashola, this was a policy that added to our GDP growth.\nOn April 23, 2010, President Jonathan signed the Local Content Law, that he had promoted, into law. This law had the effect of forcing the oil majors in Nigeria to employ only Nigerians for certain specified jobs in the oil industry and to use only Nigerian contractors for certain contracts.\nBecause of this law, Shell Petroleum Development Company awarded its first ever deep pressure pipeline contract to an indigenous Nigerian company, SCC Nigeria limited to the tune of $50 million in 2011. Total also awarded a multi-million dollarcontract to Nigerdock, an indigenous firm, to fabricate platforms and top sides for its off shore operations.\nWhen Nigerdock delivered on the project in June this year, the Executive Secretary of the Nigerian Content Development and Monitoring Board (NCDMB), Mr. Patrick Daziba Obah said “I am proud to say that this laudable achievement is a direct result of the enactment and implementation of the Nigerian Oil and Gas Industry Content Development Act of 2010 and the overwhelming support that the Government has given and has continued to give to the development of Local Content in the Oil and Gas industry”.\nThis is another policy that led to the steady GDP growth of the Jonathan era.\nIn agriculture, the Jonathan administration has a policy known as the e-wallet policy fir fertilizer distribution which cut out the middle man and sent texts to farmers on where to pick up fertilizer after payment was deducted from their e-wallet. The administration also banned the importation of rice an act that attracted Olam Farms to come to Nigeria to build the largest rice mill in Nigeria in Nasarawa state. Olam farms invested $130 million in the Nigerian rice industry.\nBecause of these policies, Nigeria’s food import bill reduced from ₦1.1 trillion in 2011 to ₦648 billion by 2012 (the figure has now skyrocketed back to pre-Jonathan levels because the Buhari administration reversed Jonathan’s ban on rice importation for reasons best known to it).\nAnother policy which drove GDP growth under Jonathan was the policy of 70% Tariff on imported cars to dissuade Nigerians from continuing to spend $3.4 billion annually on importing foreign cars.\nThis policy forced Nissan, Kia and Hyundai to establish assembly plants in Nigeria for the manufacturing of partially made in Nigeria vehicles. President Jonathan ordered federal government ministries, departments and parastatals to patronize these vehicles along with cars made by Innoson motors.\nThis policy had the effect of attracting over $150 million foreign direct investment into the Nigerian automotive industry and prevented hundreds of millions of dollars from leaving Nigeria to purchase imported cars.\nTime would not permit me to talk of the Nagropreneur program or the fact that under Jonathan not only did CNN Money project Nigeria as the world’s third fastest growing economy but that the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development named Nigeria the number 1 destination for foreign direct investment in Africa.\nI also would not have the time to write about how the Jonathan administration added 1.3 million jobs in 2013 alone (per the National Bureau of Statistics, the same agency that revealed that Nigeria lost 4.58 million jobs in the first year of the Buhari administration).\nSo, in conclusion, no Mr. Fashola, high oil prices may have contributed to GDP growth during the previous administration but it was ideas that drove growth under Jonathan and it is lack of ideas not low oil prices that is stifling growth under President Buhari.\nThis is more so when you consider that US President elect, Donald Trump, has not even been sworn in, yet today, he named some members of his cabinet. That is real change, not the reverse change promised by someone who waited for six months after his swearing in before naming his cabinet consisting of an Agriculture minister who studied French and other misfits! That is what is to blame for your recession Mr. Fashola. That and not low oil prices.\nReno Omokri is the founder of the Mind of Christ Christian Center in California,\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"http://www.vanguardngr.com/2016/11/fashola-buhari-administration-bereft-ideas/","2":"2045","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999866486"},{"0":"A Drowning Administration Grasps At Its Straws\nBeing the text of a press conference addressed by the National\nPublicity Secretary of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Alhaji Lai Mohammed, in Lagos on Wednesday, March 25th 2015\nGood after gentlemen and thank you for honouring our invitation to\nthis press conference.\nIt’s three days to the presidential and National Assembly elections,\nand the electioneering campaign is due to end tomorrow, Thursday.\nAs newsmen yourselves, you are undoubtedly aware that, since this campaign started, the PDP-led Jonathan Administration has dwelt less on issues and more on mudslinging. In particular, it has thrown everything but the kitchen sink at our presidential candidate, Gen. Muhammadu Buhari.\nThey say he does not have a secondary school certificate, even when the school he attended publicly released his results. They\nsay he is suffering from a terminal disease, even when it was clear that the medical report they used to back that claim was forged. They say he won’t be the one to rule, they say he will approve same-sex law, they say he will jail all Nigerians and they say he is a religious bigot.Plus they commissioned and ran the most untruthful and irresponsible documentary ever made, just to demonize him.\nWhen all the muckraking failed, woefully, because the stock of our candidate rose in direct proportion to the mudslinging he was subjected to, they went and commissioned an American media man, Richard Grenell, whom they fraudulently called an ex-US Envoy, to write an uninformed opinion piece that Gen. Buhari would Islamise Nigeria if he is elected.\nWhat an idiotic postulation! Had Mr. Grenell not been in a hurry to earn his pay, he would have engaged in a little logical thinking. A man who, as a military leader with little checks and balances, could have taken Nigerian to the Organization of Islamic Conference (OIC) or introduced the Sharia if he so wished, but did not, could not be characterized as a religious bigot. A man who rose to the lofty height\nof a General in the army could not have been a religious bigot,\nbecause no religious bigot will reach that height in the military. Of course, no religious bigot will have among his personal staff adherents of a different religion from his, and give them Sundays off so they can go to church!\nOut of their desperation, they resorted to lies and frittered away millions of Naira. After commissioning Grenell to write his misleading and unintelligent article, they then went ahead to advertise the trash on the front page of many newspapers for several days, at a huge cost of more than 400 million Naira! There is no better illustration of the idiomatic expression: Grasping at straws! Left with nothing more to use against Gen. Buhari, they held on tight and celebrated what is nothing but trash!\nBut who indeed is the author of that 419 article? Richard Grenell was never a US Envoy, as they claimed, but a spokesman for a US Ambassador to the UN. Wikipedia listed his occupation as speechwriter and lobbyist. He briefly served as a spokesman to Mitt Romney when he was a Republican presidential candidate, and he was disgraced out of the job! He is a Partner with the Los Angeles-based Capitol Media Partners. He works for his pay, and will work with any government, whether or not it is a global pariah. Mr. Grenell has worked for clients in Iran, Kazakhstan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and\nSomalia, among others. This is the man that was sold to the Nigerian public as a former American Envoy to con them into believing that his opinion represented the thinking in US Government circles. What a monumental scam from a fraudulent administration!\nGentlemen, apart from being fraudulent, this PDP-led Jonathan\nAdministration is also patently wasteful and corrupt! Or how else does one describe an Administration that has been wooing voters with huge bribes?\nNever in the history of our country has a President superintended over such a morally-repugnant act as the massive bribery of Nigerians in recent times, especially in the six weeks for which the elections were cunningly postponed. We make bold to say that no President has ever encouraged bribery and corruption as President Goodluck Jonathan has done by ferreting public funds into the pockets of a few in the desperation to woo voters.\nWhat this President has done by wooing voters with money amounts to undermining democracy, an action that is unbecoming of a democratically-elected leader of any country.\nAccording to the information in the public domain, an immense amount of money, some as high as 250,000 dollars per head, was given to traditional rulers, youths, entertainers, market women, ethnic militias and artisans.\nIf the money being recklessly given away is from the public treasury, the implication is that they want to loot the treasury to such a level that if they lose the elections, the next government will have no money to spend.\nIf they say the bribe money is not from the public treasury, then where is it from? If the money being nonchalantly frittered away is the President’s personal money, where did he get that kind of money from?\nTo make matters worse, the bribe money has transformed, in the Jonathan Administration’s skewed meaning of that word, from Naira to the US dollar, a clear indication that the Administration has lost confidence in the national currency and has nothing but disdain for it.\nPeople are wondering why the Naira, which was exchanging at 160 to the Dollar when the Jonathan Administration assumed office, is now exchanging at an all-time high of 226. Well, apart from the falling price of crude oil in the international market, the reason for the huge depreciation in the value of the national currency is the unprecedented abuse to which it has been subjected by the Jonathan Administration, which apparently is engaging in a frenzied mop-up of the Dollar for bribery purposes.\nWhat the Jonathan Administration did not realize is that it would not have needed to bribe Nigerians to vote for it, if it had spent the past six years engaging in purposeful governance, instead of shameless politicking.\nWhen they should have worked diligently for the betterment of the lives of Nigerians, in accordance with their oath of office, they opted to work for themselves. When they should have served the people, they chose to serve themselves. Now they need the votes of the same people and, having realized they have not served them, they decided to bribe them to get their votes. Nigerians are not stupid, as the Jonathan Administration will soon realize.\nGentleman, recall that on March 21st, our party issued a statement in which we raised the alarm over a plot to arrest some of our leaders, especially Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, on trumped-up charges.\nThough they rushed to deny it, we have it on good authority that they have not given up on that evil plot. In fact, they have now cast their net wide to ensnare more APC chieftains, including Senator Bukola Saraki, Malam Nasir El-Rufai, Senator Femi Ojudu, Hon Dakuku Peterside, Senator Isiaka Adeleke, Senator Sola Adeyeye, Senator Jajere, Senator Serika Hadi, Senator Jide Omoworare, Hon Nathaniel Agunbiade and Hon Bimbo Daramola.\nThe plot is to plant ammunition, PVCs and card reader jammers, which they have dubiously acquired, in the residence, office or vehicle of these APC chieftains. The APC chieftains will then be arrested with fanfare and subjected to trumped-up charges.\nNow, as Nigerians go to the polls on Saturday, we urge them to do so peacefully but resolutely. Irrespective of the conflicting signals from the police, they should not just vote but stay behind to defend their votes. Recall that the police first said Nigerians should vote and go home, and later reversed itself and said voters may stay back after casting their ballots. This confusion is aimed at confusing them.\nAs we said earlier, voters should ignore the unlawful order from the Inspector-General of Police urging them to go home after casting their ballots. Voters should rather listen to the INEC Chairman, Prof. Attahiru Jega, who said the electoral law does not state anywhere that voters cannot or should not wait to watch and ensure that their votes are counted. We are therefore urging the electorate to make sure they stay behind to protect their votes after casting their ballots, as was the case in 2011.\nOn a lighter note, we have received support from unusual quarters on this issue. First Lady Patience Jonathan has also asked Nigerians to ignore the police directive and defend their votes. At least on this issue, we and the First Lady are on the same page!\nIn conclusion, we have just learnt of the statement by Dr. Fredrick Fasheun of the OPC that he will deploy OPC members to every polling unit across the country to monitor the presidential elections. This is simply outrageous and nonsensical. In the first instance, Dr. Fasheun’s party, the UPN, is not even on the ballot because a court has ruled that it cannot contest the elections. Secondly, in what capacity will Dr. Fasheun deploy OPC members to monitor the elections?\nIs OPC accredited by INEC to monitor the polls? When did ethnic militias become election monitors? This is what President Jonathan has caused by drafting outlaws into the electoral process, all in a desperation to win. Now, those who should be in jail are calling the shots on national elections. What an anomaly!\nWe will like to remind Nigerians that the issues that will shape these elections remain the same: Unemployment, especially among our youths; insecurity of lives and property, as can be seen in the continued disappearance of the Chibok girls and the killing of over 15,000 innocent Nigerians by the terror group Boko Haram; unprecedented corruption, or stealing if you like to use their parlance and dilapidated infrastructure. These issues must not be buried under the avalanche of muckraking and sleazy campaign embarked by the PDP-led Jonathan Administration.\nWe will like to use this opportunity to thank Nigerians for their immense support for our party since the electioneering campaign started. We thank them for conducting themselves in a peaceful manner despite the provocations. We urge them to be extra vigilant in the days ahead, because anti-democratic forces will do everything to thwart the will of the people. Above all, we ask all our members and supporters to be peaceful before, during and after the elections. We say no to violence of any kind, and we are supremely confident that in the end, the will of the people will prevail.\nI thank you for listening\nAlhaji Lai Mohammed\nNational Publicity Secretary\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"http://www.vanguardngr.com/2015/03/what-the-jonathan-administration-did-not-realise-apc/#sthash.h4PUOVkQ.dpuf-","2":"2315","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999904633"},{"0":"By Ndahi Marama\nMAIDUGURI—AS the Mallam Adamu Ciroma-led Northern Political Leaders Forum, NPLF, prepares to pick a consensus presidential candidate from the four top aspirants from the North ahead of party primaries, one of the contenders, Governor Bukola Saraki of Kwara State has pledged to accept the outcome of the Forum’s resolution.\nSaraki, who spoke to journalists in Maiduguri shortly after a meeting with Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, delegates, said he would nonetheless abide by the decision reached by the forum despite his “glaring acceptability and impressive track record as the Governor of Kwara State in the last seven and half years.”\nHis words: “I have said it repeatedly that I shall accept the decision of the group whether it is in favour of my presidential ambition or not. I can tell you without fear of contradiction that I have not changed my position on that. I believe in the power of the people and whatever the outcome is will be accepted.”\nHe said he was in the race because he believes he can contribute to the socio-economic growth of the nation and make life better for the Nigerian people, adding that his leadership experience as a governor and his performance in the three key areas of agricultural revolution, poverty alleviation and job creation.\nHe said: “These are what stand me out among other contenders. But then, I keep on asking Nigerians to ask other aspirants who among them is addressing issues that matter to their lives and families and could impact on their lives?”\nHe noted that Nigeria needed a leader who could address the problem of food, education, health, road and electricity. He said the issue of power supply ought to be tackled seriously, noting that the economic, psychological and medical loss of the people were unquantifiable since the power sector became comatose.\nDr. Saraki disclosed that his state enjoys electricity supply for about 20 hours daily, adding that the state government under his leadership took the power situation seriously to ensure that the people do not suffer unnecessarily, while commercial activities driven by electricity was equally encouraged through the government intervention.\nHe said: “I do know that the Kwara of 2003 when I took over is now different from 2010 and I thank God for that. Even the opposition and our critics can testify that the state has indeed witness a radical change.\n“This implies that all we need is leadership that is focus, truthful and committed.”\nto giving his people hope for a better life,” he added.\nHe also said the Federal Government ought not to lose hope on the possibility of getting crude oil in the Lake Chad area, adding that he would do everything possible to ensure the exploration was sustained. He said discovery of oil in the area would be his priority while agriculture would be given prominent.\nWhile underscoring the need to conduct a free and fair election in the 2011 poll, he urged Nigerians not to allow their mandate slip into the hands of those he said could use power to advance personal interest. He said the collective interest of the citizenry ought to supersede individual gains.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"http://www.vanguardngr.com/2015/12/how-okonjo-iweala-diverted-n61-4bn-abacha-loot-to-nsa-report/http://thenationonlineng.net/okonjo-iweala-dasuki-got-322m-abacha-loot-from-me/I","2":"665","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999732971"},{"0":"Jonathan has failed Nigerians – APC\nThe All Progressive Congress Presidential Campaign Organisation (APCPCO) has said the claim by President Goodluck Jonathan that four years are not enough to transform the country is a “double-mouthing” by a President who has failed to deliver on his own timeline.\nA statement signed by the Director of Media and Publicity of the APCPCO, Mallam Garba Shehu, on Tuesday, said: “It is very imprudent of Mr. President to shift the goal post mounted by him in the middle of the game.\n“It was this same President Jonathan who said in 2010 that if he could not improve on the country’s power generation capacity within four years, then it means he could not do anything.\n“What was the president thinking about when he said: ‘Four years are enough for anyone to make significant improvement, and if I can’t improve on power within this period, then it means I cannot do anything.’\n“Nigerians expect that a President must own up to his own words and be responsible for his own beliefs.\n“There can only be one reason why President Jonathan is changing his own beliefs about what it takes to transform the country and that is because he is incompetent for the job.\n“Today, Nigerians are clamouring for change because, for six years the country has been led by a President who cannot give the people direction on how to stop corruption, how to provide security, create employment and provide infrastructure that will impact positively on the economy.\n“We have said it in the past and we will be repeating it that the 2015 election, more than anything is a referendum on the performance of President Jonathan.

This is not a word that watchers of the aviation industry will freely use in an assessment of Ms. Stella Oduah, Minister for Aviation. It was not always that way. Oduah, a major player in President Goodluck Jonathan’s campaign, started out like a house on fire. Shortly after becoming minister, she turned her attention to the country’s decrepit airports and quickly commenced a lavish remodelling of 11.\nIt was a move that attracted huge applause from members of the public, who had become disenchanted with the shabbiness of such facilities. The airport rehabilitation exercise has since been hobbled by a shortage of funds and the applause has thinned out.\nMore worryingly, what is left of Oduah’s deposit of goodwill is experiencing rapid depletion on account of what she brands as a restructuring of the agencies under her ministry. This has put her under the headlights of public scrutiny. And the result has been less than flattering, as it contains a strong whiff of an ethnic agenda.\nOduah’s recent appointments in such agencies have provoked allegations of “ethnic cleansing”. At the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria, FAAN, Oduah sacked eight General Managers, GMs. Six of them hail from the Southwest, while two are from the North.\nThose affected by the weeding process are Solanke Gideon Akintunde, GM, Facilitation; Mrs. Ayeni Folashade Olufemi, acting GM, Internal Audit; Mr. Komolafe Samuel, GM, Commercial; Mr. Oyedepo Adeyemi Biodun, GM, Mechanical; Mr. Adefarasin Adeoye Emmanuel, GM Stores; Mr. Tanko Idris, GM, Management Services; Alhaji Maltala Iliyasu, GM, Finance; and Mr. Bello Olu Kayode, acting GM, Internal Audit. The minister also redeployed six senior staff– four GMs and two Regional Managers–and appointed 75 new staff in the agency. Forty of the new appointees are from the South-East. The minister hails from Anambra State.\nAt the Nigerian Airspace Management Agency, NAMA, the minister has appointed about 107 staff since August, with 12 percent of them from the North, 20 percent from the South-West and 68 percent from the South East. This works out at 73 slots for the minister’s geo-political zone. A creditable imitation of this trend was produced at the Nigeria College of Aviation Technology, NCAT, Zaria, where Captain Adebayo Araba, rector of the college, was replaced by Captain Chinyere Kalu. Last year, the minister chucked Alhaji Ibrahim Usman Auyo as NAMA Managing Director. His replacement was Engineer Nnamdi Udoh. At the Nigerian Meterological Agency, NIMET, Dr. Anthony Anuforom, a South-Easterner, was re-appointed as Director-General.\nAlso last year, Engineer Sam Oduselu, Commissioner of the Accident Investigation Bureau, AIB, with Captain Muhtar Usman. Oduselu was relieved of his appointment seven months into his second term of office and no strong reason was offered. Oduselu’s sack, aviation stakeholders insist, was a violation of the Civil Aviation Act No. 6 of 2006.\nAIB sources told TheNEWS that the agency, conceived to have a lean staff strength, currently has 45 people in its employ. But Oduah has already made about 50 additional appointments, most of them from the South-East.\n“We understand that their appointments are already at an advanced stage. She is appointing between 45 and 50 new staff. She’s bringing these people without thinking about their salaries. She is choosing them mainly from the South-East where she comes from,” the source alleged. The appointments have irked stakeholders. Comrade Abdul Kareem Motajo, acting General Secretary, National Union of Air Transport Employees, NUATE, accused the minister of destroying the industry with her bad policies.\n“If you look at what is happening, the minister is sowing the seeds of a tribal agenda. At the audit department of FAAN, the General Manager has been sacked and an Igbo lady is coming to occupy the seat. Six other officers from the South-West have also been removed from that office in other to accommodate the new people that are coming in. Comrade Olayinka Abioye, Deputy General Secretary for the Air Transport Services Senior Staff Association of Nigeria, ATSSSAN, described the pattern of appointments made by Oduah as an indication that she is unfit for the job. “My take is that she is not only promoting ethnic agenda, but a destructive restructuring where mediocrities are imported to truncate or stunt careers of our qualified members,” he said\nOne of those appointed as GMs, said a source, “graduated just four years ago and has jumped ahead of people who have been working for over 20 years. For the next six months, he will be going for training at the expense of the agency. These are the things we are fighting against because they portend real danger to the industry and we are not going to allow that to happen,” said the source.\nComrade Odinaka Jude Igbokwe, NUATE’s Senior Organising Secretary, is of the view that Oduah started well and sustained the momentum for a while before the wheels came off. “She did some commendable things, including submitting all the concessions at FAAN to a review. But now, she is doing many terrible things, like appointing people to positions they do not deserve. She is bringing greenhorns to occupy positions that are meant for experienced people. To me that will lead to a total disruption in the industry. Many aviation professionals have no job and when you bring people from outside the industry, that is the worst thing you can do to the industry. The way she has taken off and going ahead is not going to help the industry,” he reckoned.\nIgbokwe also accused the minister of opaqueness in the award of contracts.\n“Look at what she calls remodelling of airports. FAAN, which owns the airports, does not know what she is doing. For the first time in my life, I see a government contract for which the name of the contractor is not known. We do not know the architect or what the contract is all about,” he said with barely concealed disgust.\nAnother anomaly that has sparked anger in the sector is the reappointment of Captain Henry Omegui as FAAN’s Director of Airport Operations. Omegui was said to have been indicted for a variety of corruption-related activities.\nApart from labour leaders, the minister’s actions and policies often get criticised by other stakeholders in the sector. They generally think her policies are not good. One of her staunchest critics is Captain Dele Ore, a veteran Nigerian pilot and President, Aviation Round Table. Ore alleged on 27 July that Oduah threatened to “deal with him” in a telephone conversation.\n“At 11.13 a.m. today 27 July, 2012, the Honourable minister of aviation, Princess Stella Oduah, called me from a number “08055024340” and showered unprintable insults on my person, threatening my life while promising to deal with me. This conversation lasted 3 minutes and 8 seconds, and she claimed that I have been writing rubbish, lies and fabrications about her in the media.”\nOre explained that he was not against the minister as a person but against her policies and management style, which threaten the sector. Specifically, Ore criticised the minister for the airport remodelling project she has embarked upon, saying it did not follow due process and that she was utilising funds meant for other purposes to execute it.\nThere was also bewilderment when Oduah cancelled the contract between FAAN and Maevis Nigeria Limited, its revenue generating concessionaire, at Lagos and Abuja airports. The cancellation was in disobedience of a presidential directive. Tunde Fagbemi, Maevis Managing Director, has insisted that his contract with FAAN was to last until 2017. Both parties are in court.\nOduah also drew the ire of Dr. Wale Babalakin when she began remodelling the General Aviation Terminal in Lagos in disobedience of a concession agreement between FAAN and Bi-Courtney Aviation Services Limited, builders and managers of the Murtala Muhammed Airport 2, MMA2. According the contract, all domestic airlines in Lagos should operate from MMA2. Oduah’s remodelling of the General Aviation Terminal is a direct hit on Babalakin, as Arik and other domestic airlines have been encouraged to give MMA 2 a wide berth.\nAt a press conference two weeks ago, NUATE and ATSSSAN identified ten areas in which they reckon that Oduah has failed. These, naturally, include the perceived lack of fairness in appointments.\nThe unions insisted that the new appointments have not followed due process and do not reflect federal character. “We have also observed that some unqualified elements are being decorated with the toga of General Managers without the prerequisite experience, expertise, skills and qualification as stipulated in the public service rules and or the subsisting conditions of service in the various agencies. To add insult to an already sore wound, the Minister of Aviation has approved that a graduate of four years, without any sense of public service duties, be made a General Manager,” the unions raged.\nAnother area of failure, according to the unions, could be noticed in Oduah’s creation of directorates, something she is said to have no power to do. “The minister does not have the authority and competence to create extra directorates without approval from the Office of the Head of Service. The new Directorate created in FAAN, for instance, is a breach of establishment laws and a contravention of the position of the Chief Executive of FAAN, who had once claimed that he does not require more than three hundred personnel at the FAAN headquarters even with six directorates, which are being indiscriminately increased to nine,” said the unions.\nOduah has also been accused of meddlesomeness in the day to day running of the agencies, which are allegedly run according to her own rules. “How else can one describe the ongoing remodelling of our airports without following due process; where contractors are unknown; where nobody knows the costs of such gigantic projects; whereby FAAN which is supposed to supervise and grant necessary approvals for work done is nowhere near the projects; and where NAMA, which has no business in the so called re-modelling, is involved in paying as much as over N200 million as custom duties for items for the remodeling of our airports?” the groups asked.\nThe groups reckon that their criticism of the minister has placed them firmly in her gunsights and she is itching to shoot. “The minister has begun the unholy process of collating and collecting names of union leaders at the branch and national levels for possible transfers, dismissals and or retrenchment,” they alleged.\nSimilarly slammed on Oduah is that accusation of failure to assist aviation agencies to collect their debts from airlines. “It is necessary to ask the minister what efforts she has made to effect the collection of outstanding indebtedness of her agencies such as FAAN, NAMA and others, which can barely pay staff salaries from airlines and or concessionaries, considering the precarious financial situation of agencies,” the unions said. They also wondered why FAAN and other agencies, which can barely pay staff salaries and promote staff or pay other statutory deductions, are being saddled with additional directorates created by the minister.\nBefore now, Oduah’s stay in office has hardly been plain sailing. After the initial flourish of the airport remodelling exercise, the aviation sector was hit by a series of problems, not exactly created by her. In May, the price of aviation fuel soared to N190 per litre, a development that strangulated domestic airlines. Of the nine airlines in business, three (Midwest, Chanchangi and Associated Airlines) gave up the ghost on account of huge debts. Those that survived–Arik Air, Aero Contractors, IRS Airlines, Overland Airways, Dana Air and Air Nigeria–kept gasping. Things grew worse. Currently, only four commercial airlines remain in the skies and most of them owe tonnes of debts to aviation agencies, foreign and local banks as well as the Assets Management Corporation of Nigeria, AMCON.\nLast month, the Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN, barred the top two airlines from receiving any additional loans over their massive outstanding debts. Arik Air, the nation’s top carrier owes AMCON more than $534 million, according to the CBN, while Aero Contractors, owes more than $203 million to the state-run company.\nUgo Okoroafor, a Central Bank spokesman, warned that any bank that goes against the CBN directive on the airlines would face serious sanctions.\nThough he acknowledged the difficulties in the industry, he said the bank can no longer allow massive debts to pile up on the nation’s banks and threaten the financial market.\n“Adverse consequences exist for people who take part in such unhealthy acts,” Okoroafor warned. In August, the scale of decay was further exposed in the report by an investigative panel, set up after the 3 June crash of a Dana Air plane, by the Ministry of Aviation.The panel concluded that the country’s aviation sector is in such a bad shape that only a state of emergency could prevent its total collapse.\nGroup Captain John Obakpolor (retd.), who headed the panel, said the sector would need at least N500billion to survive.\n“At the end of its deliberations, the committee came up with 59 findings and 41 recommendations, in line with the terms of reference. The federal government should immediately declare an emergency in the aviation sector and commence implementation of the Aviation Safety Emergency Programme,” Obakpolor said.\nHe added that the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority, NCAA, should ensure that airline operators are put under closer surveillance. “Maintenance actions carried out by operators, if not routine, should always be queried to establish what necessitated the maintenance action and ensure the continuous proper use of the technical logbook,” he said. The crash that provoked the probe attracted public anger to Oduah, who was accused of insensitivity when she restored the licence of the airline when the bodies its 163 victims were yet to be buried because of delay in the identification process.\nThere was also bewilderment when Oduah cancelled the contract between FAAN and Maevis Nigeria Limited, its revenue generating concessionaire at Lagos and Abuja airports. The cancellation was in disobedience of a presidential directive. Tunde Fagbemi, Maevis Managing Director has insisted that his contract with FAAN was to last until 2017. Both parties are in court. Oduah also drew the Dr. Wale Babalakin when she began remodeling the General Aviation Terminal in Lagos in disobedience of a concession agreement between FAAN and Bi-Courtney Aviation Services Limited, builders and managers of the Murtala Muhammed Airport2, MMA2. According the contract, all domestic airlines in Lagos should operate from MMA2.\nBut Joe Obi, Special Assistant (Media) to Oduah, argued that the minister should be commended rather than condemned for what she has done in the ministry and dismisses allegations that she is pursuing an ethnic agenda. “I think the minister needs to be commended. There was no lopsidedness in terms of Federal Character in the appointments. Those within the agencies who merited promotion but were unduly stagnated by previous administrations have been promoted,” he told TheNEWS.\nObi described the dissent of the unions as “the traditional resistance to change and nothing more”.\n—SIMON ATEBA.

In the coming days, it will be important for the future of this country that Nigerians not let their differences divide them, and that the legally established process for resolving challenges to the election be allowed to take its course. We commend Mr. Obi and Mr.\nAbubakar for their recent statements committing to take this path, and Mr. Tinubu, who INEC declared the president-elect under Nigeria’s electoral framework, for acknowledging their right to do so.\nThe United States is no stranger to election-related controversy and conflict. As much as it can be unsatisfying to end an electoral process in a courtroom, in a constitutional democracy bound by the rule of law, that is where electoral conflicts may appropriately conclude.\nIt is clear that the electoral process as a whole on February 25 failed to meet Nigerians’ expectations. As I said numerous times prior to the elections, Nigeria has accomplished much in just the two-plus decades since the return to democracy, and a gradual improvement in the quality of its elections in that time constitutes one of those accomplishments. We recognize that Nigerians want that positive trend to continue, including through the use of new technology intended to make the process of reporting results more transparent. We thus reiterate our call on INEC to address promptly the challenges that can be resolved ahead of the March 11 gubernatorial elections, and to undertake a broader review of the problems that transpired during the last elections and what can be done to fix them. In all cases, INEC should share with the Nigerian public information about the actions it is taking.\nI also want to highlight some of the remarkable results from this past election that show how Nigeria’s political landscape is indisputably changing. In more than half of the states – 20 – the winning candidate represented a different party than that of the incumbent governor. Twelve of these states are led by APC governors. For the first time, four presidential candidates won at least one state, and the top three each won 12 states based on these initial results. In the National Assembly elections, even with results still incomplete, we already know that changes are afoot: seven sitting governors lost in their attempts to win election to the Assembly; the Labor Party has won at least seven seats in the Senate; the NNPP has won at least 11 seats in the House of Representatives.\nThe Nigerian people have made clear their desire for responsive and inclusive governance, and we strongly support their ability to express that desire. The United States and Nigeria are the two largest presidential democracies in the world, and longtime partners. As Nigeria goes through these next weeks and months, we stand with you.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"https://www.vanguardngr.com/2023/03/presidential-elections-failed-to-meet-nigerians-expectations-u-s-ambassador/","2":"721","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999980927"},{"0":"By Suzan Edeh\nAs the 2011 general election draws nearer, Over 8,710 members of the Congress for Progressive Change (CPC) belonging to Karamba Ibrahim faction of the party in Bauchi state are set to declare their defection within this week.\nThis came as members are alleging lack of internal democracy in the party as preached by Gen.Muhammadu Buhari (rtd), in addition to lack of respect for party rules and regulations by National officers of the party who should have ensured strict adherence to party constitution.\nAccording to a press statement signed by CPC former administrative secretary, Baba Abba Misau, the members said, “fake registers and membership registration cards were printed by an ingrate and factional leader and the recent Party’s ward congress was only held in 7 out the 20 local government areas in the state, but to our surprise, the result for 20 local governments were sent to the National Secretariat by the state Caretaker Committee”.\nAccording to Abba, the CPC leadership structure from wards, local government councils to state levels of the Karamba faction have unanimously resolved to defect to the Action Congress of Nigeria.\nThe statement advised the National Leadership to be bold to discuss the shortcomings of the dissolved state executives which was made on September 27, 2010,as the members’ decision is based on the authority of Nigeria’s Constitution which guarantees every citizen the right to free association and speech.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"http://www.vanguardngr.com/2011/01/8710-cpc-members-in-bauchi-decamp-to-acn/","2":"313","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999752045"},{"0":"Web designer arrested for defiling maid\nThe Police in Ogun State have arrested an Abeokuta based website designer, Abiodun Amosu(42 ), for defiling his 16 year old housemaid.\nAmosu who lives at the Ibara housing Estate was said to have dragged the girl into his bedroom last Thursday while his wife was away in Lagos and allegedly defiled her.\nThe Police Public Relations Officer in Ogun state, Abimbola Oyeyemi, on Sunday, stated that the suspect was arrested following a complaint at the Ibara Police division by the Benue state born victim, who was accompanied to the station by a member of the Committee for the Defence of Human Rights (CDHR).\nThe victim told the Police that Amosu forcefully dragged her into his bedroom and sexually assaulted her, and even when she was shouting after the man has had his way, he still beat her up and sent her away.\nAccording to the Police Spokesman, a CDHR member who sighted the victim in her pitiable condition, took her to the Police station to report the incident.\n“Upon the report, the DPO Ibara division, Dada Olusegun, led detectives to the scene where the randy suspect was arrested.

The story is not new, but it won’t go away. Much has been done to suppress this story, but the story is like a body that refuses to stay buried. It resurfaces every time Mr. Tinubu makes a move. It is the unsettled ghost of a life and a time of imponderable risks and high ambition. It adds to the complicated and unfinished, eve enigmatic life of Tinubu.\nControversy around Tinubu blew open in 1999 soon after he got the ticket of the Alliance for Democracy (AD) to contest for the governorship of Lagos. The climate of prebendal politics arising from the first post-June 12 election had thrown up Tinubu. Every political interest was aimed at getting the transition off the table, and sending the military back to the barracks; and all permutations were geared in those heady days between August 1998 and May 1999 to placating what was generally known then as the “Yoruba interest,” because of the perceived injustices of the June 12 election cancellation by the military junta, and the subsequent death of Bashorun Moshood Abiola in detention.\nBola Tinubu had just entered the political fray, and was a senator elected under the Social Democratic Party (SDP). He was also a known associate of Bashorun Abiola and, in that proximity, he became a key actor in the post-election negotiations, and subsequently, in the fight to certify Mr. Abiola as President.\nTinubu became a very key advocate of the June 12 election, and took to exile with a few known actors to push for, and lobby the “international community,” particularly the United States government, for the revalidation of the June 12 election that had been canceled by the military and that led to the imprisonment of Abiola. Tinubu deployed his enormous resources internationally to that fight, and many, including the poet and playwright, Wole Soyinka, have acknowledged this.\nBut where did Bola Tinubu get all the resources? Certainly it was not from his legitimate earnings as Treasurer at Mobil. This was the question that hung thinly in the air, and was not to out until he was basically railroaded into the AD ticket, and in that situation, elected the governor of Lagos. A loud voice rent the air in 1999 by many concerned citizens in the city of Lagos about the new governor. The stories he supplied in his affidavit did not match with any known truth about Bola Tinubu.\nIn fact, there was no Bola Tinubu. He was a ghost! First, he was not really from Lagos. He was from a place called Iragbaiji, in the hinterlands of Osun State. How did he therefore end up being the son of the Iyaloja of Lagos, Madam Tinubu? Second, Bola Tinubu claimed to have attended, first, a non-existent school, a St. Paul’s School Aroloya; the Children’s Home School, Ibadan; then the elite Government College Ibadan, and then also, the University of Chicago.\nFirst, there is no record of a St. Paul’s School in Aroloya; no one remembered Tinubu at the Government College Ibadan. As for the University of Chicago, his name was not in their rolls. As it turned out, he may have attended Chicago State University, which by no stretch of the imagination was the University of Chicago. So, who was the real Bola Tinubu? The late Gani Fawehinmi fired off the first real challenge against what became clearly a case of lies and forgeries against Bola Ahmed Tinubu.\nOn October 5, 1999, Gani Fawehinmi approached the courts and demanded an order of mandamus against the Attorney General and the Inspector General of Police for the court to compel them to investigate the governor of Lagos who had presented forged documents to qualify to run for election. Of course nothing came of those fights by Gani. If anything he was betrayed in this fight by those who were once brilliant advocates of public morality.\nLagos State House of Assembly, in a sham exercise, had cleared Bola Tinubu. But cleared him of what? To this day, Mr. Tinubu is still to show any evidence of his schooling. No one knows where he attended primary school, or where he went to secondary. No one has ever emerged to say he went to school with Bola Tinubu. So, with what did he secure admissions to the Richard Daley College, and then to Chicago State University? There is no record that he even studied for or obtained the GED – the standard preparatory certificate for those who did not have a high school diploma to qualify for college in the United States.\nSo, if Bola Tinubu did not go to any known schools in Nigeria, with what did he obtain admissions to college in the United States. It is alleged that Tinubu may have “perfected” and obtained his certificates from “Oluwole.’ I do speculate, of course, and I have no evidence. Oluwole is the forgery capital of Nigeria. If God had a signature, and you wanted it, they would forge it at Oluwole in Lagos.\nPerhaps those who doubt Tinubu’s schooling should go back to Richard Daley College, and, I bet, there will still be on file the documents he presented for admissions in 1969 when he was said to have left to the United States. There is very little doubt that Bola Ahmed Tinubu is a highly intelligent man. But his language proficiency is another proof that he is not a very well educated man.\nTinubu’s forgery scandal erupted around about the same time that a young man named Salisu Buhari, just elected to be the first Speaker of the House of Representatives in the fourth republic, was, rightly too, hounded by the press until he resigned in shame, for claiming to have obtained degrees from the University of Toronto, Canada.\nBut while Salisu Buhari was roasted by investigative magazines like The News, the same magazine suppressed the more egregious case of Bola Tinubu, in spite of the claims put up by Fawehinmi. And guess who was Editor-in-Chief and CEO of the News at that point when it lost its investigative nerves? That’s right! Bayo Onanuga, the current chief spokesman for the Tinubu Presidential Campaign.\nMuch of the Lagos press clammed up. That was one of my greatest moments of disappointment with the press, because of what I felt was a half-hearted pursuit of the Tinubu case. Then came the ENRON scandal, and then came in 2003 a new scandal: the question of Tinubu’s alleged involvement in drug trade. That story too was buried. But it has refused to disappear. Last week, a certified true copy of court documents from the US District Court in Chicago, indicting Bola Ahmed Tinubu for drug trafficking and money laundering, resurfaced.\nIt has set a lot of tongues wagging and a lot of Tinubu’s handlers sweating, and running all over the place to douse the fire ignited by the implications of the revelations in these documents. The court papers revealed that Bola Tinubu was the owner of ten bank accounts used in drug trade and he was in business with another very well-known Nigerian drug trafficker, Adegboyega Mueez Akande. Now the upshot, Bola Tinubu, in what is clearly a plea bargain, forfeited the money in his bank accounts. It is of course, as scandals go, salacious.\nBut it needs to be settled once and for all so that Nigerians would know whether Ahmed Bola Tinubu is an innocent man getting a bad rap from his relentless political enemies, or whether he is a danger to Nigeria and its democracy, because Nigeria cannot afford to elect a drug lord. On Wednesday, on Channels TV, Mr. Festus Keyamo, a senior lawyer, Junior Minister for Labour, and current Deputy Campaign Chief for the Bola Tinubu Campaign, tried all kinds of bluster to explain away the situation. He even went so far as to say the “dictionary meaning of forfeiture is not the same as its legal meaning.”\nHe did propose all kinds of scenario in which he claimed, for instance, that Bola Tinubu and his bank accounts are separate entities, and, as a result, it was not Bola Tinubu that was indicted. He, in fact, did suggest that it was Tinubu who, generously, told the US government, “go, and sin no more!” It was very unconvincing! It all seemed like the kind of argument a tuppeny lawyer could make.\nBut Festus Keyamo, who is preserved in record as calling Bola Ahmed Tinubu a criminal in the past, seems now to be eating his own vomit. We shall leave Mr. Keyamo alone for the moment, and ask this serious question: Did Bola Tinubu ever engage in heroin trafficking and money laundering for which he had to make a plea bargain leading to the forfeiture of his bank balance? If he did, then he must be barred from further contesting this election.\nThe implication of a Bola Tinubu, if he was a former drug baron, contesting for the presidency of Nigeria is far too disturbing for words. If he ever gets elected, he presents a major national security risk, and Nigeria would officially have joined the rank of pariah narco-nations. Nigerians should just say “Tufia!” to that. On the other hand, if Bola Tinubu is innocent of all these tarring, and never had a drug-trafficking past, all those raising this issue must be made to publicly issue an unreserved apology. This matter must be settled. It is not going to go away.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"https://www.vanguardngr.com/2022/11/tinubus-drug-allegation/","2":"2166","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999885559"},{"0":"The Nigeria Military on Tuesday said four armed herdsmen have been killed and about 20 other suspects arrested in Benue State.\nDirector Army Public Relations, Brigadier General, Texas Chukwu in a statement on Tuesday said the troops of special forces arrested the armed herdsmen during a patrol at Teguma village.\n“Troops of 72 Special Forces Battalion on April 16, 2018, on Operation MESA at Yogbo in Guma Local Government Area of Benue State encountered about 20 militia herdsmen at Teguma village while on patrol.\n“Four of the militia herdsmen were neutralised during the encounter while others fled following superior gun power,” the statement read in part.\nItems recovered from the suspects include four AK 47 rifles, five 7.62mm rounds of ammunition and 28 rounds of 7.62 police special ammunition.\nThe Nigerian army also recently killed one herdsman in Benue.\nBenue State has been a hotbed of herdsmen-farmers crisis which has led to several attacks that have since sent many Benue residents to their early graves, most notably on New Year’s Day.

We will confront the few misguided persons who falsely believe that through violence, they can impose their agenda of hate and division on this nation of good people.\n“We must confront all those who think they can derail us by engaging in indiscriminate violence and mass murder, perpetrated in places of worship, in markets and public places, against the media, and security personnel. Nigeria is a nation of resilient people. We will never yield to the forces of darkness.

If we believe this to be a sacred obligation, it will not matter whether we are Christians or Muslims, or politicians, irrespective of political parties or divide. It really will not matter whether we are civil society agents, social activists or union leaders. What matters is Nigeria. This nation exists because we are one. We must, therefore, remain as one family and work together to defend our country.”\nAchievements of his administration\nSpeaking on the achievements of his administration, President Jonathan said though there were challenges, he was determined to ensure that these challenges were over come.\nHe said: “Our democracy is stable. Its foundation is strong and firm. Its future is bright. Last year, I had spoken about the policy of ‘one man one vote, one woman, one vote, one youth, one vote.’ I am glad to see that the Nigerian people in all elections have continued to respect the principle of fair play. Since this administration came into office, we have gone to great lengths to strengthen our democratic institutions, particularly the Independent National Electoral Commission. There are still persons who believe that elections should be violent and unhealthy, but they are in the minority.”\nHe reiterated that his administration was committed to fighting corruption, saying that though concrete steps have been taken to strengthen the leadership of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission and the Independent Corrupt Practices and other Offences Commission, these agencies would need the support of the courts to ensure that corrupt persons are convicted and made to face the full wrath of the law.\nAccording to the president, “the courts will have to do more in the area of fighting corruption in the country that they are doing now.\n“I want to reassure all Nigerians that this administration remains committed to waging a sustained battle against the menace of corruption. In the last one year, we have taken specific steps to reduce opportunities and avenues for corruption, and to strengthen the capacity and integrity of our institutions.\n“We have strengthened the leadership of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) and the Independent Corrupt Practices Commission (ICPC). Both agencies are being re-positioned for more effective service delivery. We will continue to strengthen the law enforcement and anti-corruption agencies for optimal performance. We will also need the support of our courts. The courts have to do more.”\nIn the area of agriculture, the president said the ultimate aim of his administration was “directed at promoting local production, substituting for imported foods, and adding value to our locally produced crops. Government’s policy to ensure rice self-sufficiency by 2015 is already paying off.”\nHe said the emergence of new rice mills by the private sector to mill locally produced rice as see by Ebony Agro Industries in Ikwo Local Government Area of Ebonyi State, Umza rice mill in Kano State and the Ashi Rice Mill in Benue State are indications that government action in the agricultural sector especially on rice production is yielding results.\nOn oil and gas sector\nIn the oil and gas sector, Jonathan said his administration had charted a new course that would ensure enduring transparency and accountability, adding that his administration has commited N11 billion provided in the 2012 Budget for Hydro-Carbon exploration in the Lake Chad Basin.\n“We are re-drafting the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) to ensure it meets the aspirations of all stakeholders given the current realities and future expectations in the global energy landscape. Work on the PIB will be concluded in June 2012 and formally submitted to the National Assembly.

Abandoning governance for politics one year into a tenure is not a good omen. “\nOn his part, House Committee Chairman on Ministry of Niger Delta Affairs and Amnesty Programme, Hon Warman Ogoriba said ”well, I think that Mr President is right because some politicians are playing politics with an issue that is considered a national security.\n“Politicians should try to differentiate between politics and issues that undermine our collective interest as one indivisible nation.”\nNigerians task Jonathan on development\nNigerians, yesterday in Lagos expressed diverse expectations from him.\nSome told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in separate interviews that although Jonathan did not perform badly in the past one year, but that he needed to do more.\nThe Leader of the Oodua Peoples’ Congress (OPC), Dr Frederick Fasheun, hailed Jonathan for holding the country together under a democratic system.\n“Jonathan has not been doing too badly at least for holding the country together under what is called seeming democracy.\n“The entire system had been damaged before he came in to office so let us give him peace of mind to work hard after all he has four years to his first term,” he said.\nAlso speaking, President, Aviation Round Table, Capt. Dele Ore, also agreed that Jonathan had not performed badly in his one year in office.\n“I think his one year in office has been very okay but we expect that his second year in office, Nigerians will get power and have a secured environment so that every one will feel safe whereever they are no matter which tribe they are.\n“He also has to really take seriously the issue of youth unemployment as well as tackling very seriously the issue of corruption besides these I think everything seems to be okay and we wish him all the best,” he said.\nHowever, the Executive Secretary of Campaign for Constitutionalism and Human Rights (CCHR), Mr Toyin Raheem, did not agree that Jonathan did well in his office.\n“We expect that as he commences his second year by tomorrow, he should ensure that he put in place machineries to ensure that we have a sovereign national conference because it has become important that we have it.\n“It is important for Nigerians to come together to decide the way we should live as Nigerians in the face of the security, unemployment and civil unrest everywhere in the land,” he said.\nLocomotive assembly plant\nThe Federal Government has signed a Memorandum of Understanding with General Electric (GE) to establish a locomotive assembly plant in the country.\nPresident Jonathan disclosed this in his broadcast yesterday.\nJonathan said the project would enhance the sustainability in the rail sector and make Nigeria a major hub in West and Central Africa.\nThe President said the administration was committed to efficient and affordable public transport system.\nHe said the transformation agenda in the road sector would deliver better and safer roads to Nigerians and link the six geo-political zones in the country with dual carriageways.\n“There have been increased construction activities in the ongoing dualisation of Abuja–Abaji–Lokoja Road, Kano–Potiskum–Maiduguri Road.”\nOthers are the Benin–Ore–Shagamu Expressway; the Onitsha–Enugu Expressway; and the construction of the Loko–Oweto bridge, across River Benue.\n“In other parts of the country, about 21 other road projects are in different stages of completion.\n“These include the Yola–Numan road, Aba–Owerri road, Owerri–Onitsha expressway, Oyo–Ogbomosho old road and the Gombe-Potiskum road,” he said.\nJonathan said that the administration in the last 12 months had completed the capital dredging of the Lower River Niger.\nHe said that work would soon commence on the dredging of the River Benue in the year.\nJonathan said that the administration had begun the development of four new international terminals at Lagos, Port- Harcourt, Kano and Abuja airports.\nHe said that work was also going on with the renovation of airports across the country.\nThe President reassured Nigerians that the administration would remain committed to waging a sustained battle against the menace of corruption.(\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"http://www.vanguardngr.com/2012/05/jonathan-promises-to-tackle-corruption-terrorism/","2":"2247","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999885559"},{"0":"A terrorist believed to be a close associate of Boko Haram leader, Abubakar Shekau has been found dead as he ran errand for the leadership.\nAccording to a statement from the Nigerian Defence Headquarters, two fellow terrorists one of which is confirmed to be a Nigerian are now in the custody of the Multinational Joint Task Force.\nThe statement which was signed by the Director Defence Information, Brigadier General Christopher Olukolade said “the three were in the process of crossing the border to the neighbouring Niger republic through the Lake Chad.\n“The three have been confirmed to have operated in Baga and participated in perpetrating arson and other atrocities around the vicinity of the town.

Nevertheless, there are still sufferings in the land. Indeed, the lamentations in our fatherland especially since Boko Haram insurgents seized our girls and the recent bombings in the creeks targeted at oil wells and oil installations raise a lot of questions and concern.\nThe country, with over 250 ethnic groups, has co-existed since the 1914 amalgamation. The era of the empires and kingdoms may have come and gone but certainly, many of our ancient cultures, traditions, beliefs, tribes and early civilisation have their origins in our old empires and kingdoms.\nNo doubt, we have come far as a nation and we have shocked the entire world by living together as one indivisible nation no matter our tribes, cultural differences and religious beliefs. The civil war was the greatest test to our survival as a nation but for us who fought the war, and like General Yakubu Gowon would say “there was no victor, no vanquish.”\nThen came the June 12 annulled election in which M.K.O. Abiola, the winner died in unexplainable circumstance. Just when the nation was at peace with itself, the Niger Delta Youths who have been crying of marginalisation and neglect of the oil-rich region took to militancy. The mangrove savannah and the rest of the nation hardly knew peace then. Worried by the militancy in the Niger Delta, the Christian Associat-ion of Nigeria, CAN, held a meeting in Port Harcourt and in attendance, as providence would have it, was His Eminence, the Sultan of Sokoto. It was at that meeting that it was agreed that the Sultan would take a message to late President Umaru Yar’Adua. Interestingly, the late former president listened to good counsel and that was how the amnesty programme was initiated.\nSomehow, getting the young adults who were in the creeks to accept amnesty was a herculean task. At a point, the late President asked his vice who is from the Niger Delta region to go and talk to his people. That was how, President Goodluck Jonathan who was the Vice to President Yar’Adua met with few leaders in the Niger Delta. The leaders which include this writer agreed to go to the creeks to meet with Tompolo after which he (Tompolo) surrendered along with his boys and they accepted amnesty. The rest is now History.\nOne had expected that the commu-nity elders and religious leaders in the North will adopt the same approach to reach out to the Boko Haram insurgents but that was not the case. Unfortunately, the Niger Delta militants have again returned to militancy in the region. This time, the bombings are so vociferous and the tune of the militants is lined with venom.\nAs at the last count, the militant groups have carried out 16 attacks on pipelines and oil installations between February 10 and June 10, 2016, a period of four months.\nAs a preacher of the gospel and a prayer warrior who has interceded for people as well as stood in the gap for the nation in the last five decades that I left the Nigerian Army for the Lord’s Vineyard, I must confess that it is the prayer of men that has kept this country as one otherwise, the doom predicted by other countries concerning our unity would have been achieved but God said “if my people shall humble themselves and pray, I will hear them.”\nI am not in any way writing to talk about how some religious people merely worship tradition rather than worship God. We know that for any-body that worships God, there must be an observed change in the life of that individual. And there is no situation that God cannot conquer. We must therefore, not take God for granted. If not for anything else, for the younger generations who did not witness the civil war or June 12. The 2015 elections proved to the world that God is at work in Nigeria.\nWe are getting to a time where money will fail us. And no man should be-have as though he is indispensable. Nigeria is fast becoming a battle field but with prayers and a listening leader, the battle can be won – Victory is sure. But we need spiritual maturity, and those who are entrust-ed with leadership must not hide from themselves, after all they are serving the same master.\nI have seen blame placed on the doorsteps of past leaders and yet not much is done to address issues such as Fulani herdsmen, destruction of farmlands and killing of innocent people. Not much has been done to address the back door introduction of Sharia in some parts of the country when Nigeria is indeed a secular state. The constitution of Nigeria mentioned Islamic marriage but nothing is said of Christian wedding. Our IDPs are filled with innocent people, some of whom are the future leaders of Nigeria.\nSimilarly, in the coastal region, life has become so brutish that you wonder if this is our once beloved fatherland. Even the rich are now crying. Of course, I hear that the poor are leaving their children in the market place after they have collected foodstuffs on the pretense that they are coming soon, just to have food to eat. The Church; and I think the other religious groups, are worried for Mr. President who was elected by the people based on public goodwill and trust. Indeed, his change mantra must not take Nigeria 10 steps backward, rather Nigeria must be seen making progress economically, socially and politically.\nThus in re-constructing the nation and reintegrating the people, rather than turn one ethnic group against the other or one region against the other, which is the semblance of the ongoing militancy in the Niger Delta and the Boko Haram insurgency in the North East have been turned into. In fact, if for anything else, President Buhari needs to re-unite Nigerians by ensuring that every Nigerian gets fair treatment. And we must know that a country dies slowly and painfully too when it evokes only indifference and indignation amongst a section of the citizenry. This is not the time to further alienate any region, rather the national development ship should be seen everywhere across Nigeria.\nAnything other than this will make even those of us who have been praying for the peace and good of Nigeria to wonder if the President has a listening ear.\n*Archbishop Avwomakpa is the chairman, Niger Delta Bishops’ Forum and president, Christ Missionaries Crusaders.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"https://www.vanguardngr.com/2023/09/i-dont-need-title-to-serve-in-tinubus-administration-fashola/amp/Word","2":"1390","3":"Politics","4":"2","5":"en","6":"0.9999084473"},{"0":"Shina Abubakar, Osogbo\nFollowing the call for a warning strike by the Nigeria Labour Congress, NLC, against continuous economic hardship, activities in various government agencies have been grounded in Osun state.\nVanguard observed that the entrance gate of the Transmission Company of Nigeria, TCN, was shut and workers were denied access to the premises.\nSimilarly, the secretariat of local government areas in the state was deserted as few workers were only hanging around the premises in numbers.\nAddressing newsmen at the TCN entrance, Vice President, West, National Union of Electricity Employee, Comrade Sodiq Adewale, said the union complied totally with the strike directive.\n“We are part of the strike and we are critical stakeholders as far as NLC is concerned.\n“Presently, in compliance with the NLC directive, we are mandated to embark on a warning strike which started today and will continue tomorrow.

ABUJA\nThe Federal Government, on Thursday, asked the Nigerian Labour Congress, NLC, and the Trade Union Congress, TUC, to shelve their plan to embark on a nationwide indefinite strike action on October 3.\nGovernment maintained that the proposed industrial action by the labour unions would amount to a gross violation of a subsisting court injunction.\nIt stressed that issues bordering on fuel subsidy removal, which informed the decision of the NLC and the TUC to declare the strike action, are already pending before the National Industrial Court, NIC.\nAccording to FG, it was due to the willingness of the unions to enter into a negotiation over the issue that it was persuaded to withdraw a contempt proceeding that it initially instituted against them.\nTherefore, the government, through the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Prince Lateef Fagbemi (SAN), wrote to the head of the legal team of the two unions, Mr. Femi Falana (SAN), urging him to persuade his clients to abort the planned strike action.\nThe letter, dated September 26, a copy of which Vanguard obtained, read: “The attention of the Ministry has been drawn to media reports on the proposed nationwide strike action by the Nigerian Labour Congress, NLC, and Trade Union Congress, TUC, scheduled to commence on 3rd October 2023.\n“You are kindly invited to recall the antecedence of previous steps/actions on this matter, particularly the exchange of correspondence between this office and your firm, before and after the nationwide ‘action/protest’ declared by the NLC on 2nd August 2023.\n“Whilst your clients had maintained that the nationwide protest by NLC is in furtherance of its constitutional right to embark on protests, the Ministry has repeatedly advised on the need to advise your clients to refrain from resorting to self-help and taking actions capable of undermining subsisting orders of a court of competent jurisdiction.\n“It is also to be recalled that based on the conduct of the said nationwide action/protest, this Office instituted contempt proceedings against the labour leaders.\n“However, upon the intervention of the President and National Assembly, coupled with the decision of the labour unions to discontinue their action/protest, the contempt proceedings were not prosecuted further.\n“This was advisedly done to enable the government and labour union engage in further negotiations without any form of encumbrances.\n“However, in its Communique issued at the end of its National Executive Council meeting on 31st August 2023, NLC resolved to embark on a total and indefinite shutdown of the nation within 14 working days or 21 days from 31st August 2023.\n“Also on 26th September 2023, the Presidents of NLC and TUC, jointly issued a communiqué stating that organised labour had resolved, ‘to embark on an indefinite and total shutdown of the nation beginning on zero hours Tuesday, the 3rd day of October, 2023.’\n“From a review of the contents of the above communiques and available media reports, the proposed strike action is premised principally in furtherance of issues connected with the removal of fuel subsidy, hike in fuel price and consequential matters of making provisions for palliatives and workers welfare.\n“These are undoubtedly issues that have been submitted to the National Industrial Court for adjudication.\n“Therefore, the proposed strike action is in clear violation of the pending interim injunctive order granted on 5th June 2023 restraining both Nigeria Labour Congress and Trade Union Congress from embarking on any industrial action/or strike of any nature, pending the hearing and determination of the pending Motion on Notice.\n“We wish to reiterate that a court order, regardless of the opinion of any party on it, remains binding and enforceable until set aside.\n“It is the expectation of the public that the labour unions would lead in obedience and observance of court orders and not in its breach.”\nThe Minister of Labour and Employment, Chief of Staff to the President, National Security Adviser, Inspector-General of Police and the Director-General, State Security Services, DSS, were copied.\nRecall that the labour unions had vowed to enforce an indefinite nationwide strike action from October 3, following Federal Government’s failure to address the economic hardship that Nigerians are currently facing owing to its unplanned removal of fuel subsidy.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee

Canny lawyers, Lobbyists, Foreign Portfolio Investors, Equity or Hedge Fund manager facilitated. Consultants use fake news to convince the world that our meager foreign income is theirs. It doesn’t matter what we call them: Ponzi Schemes, Yahoo-Yahoo, Mercenary or 419; they aid and abet financial crimes against Africa.\nUsually, most court of law would never bankrupt one opponent to pay the other so that companies and countries can still function as an entity. A financially viable opponent in court stands a better chance of paying out whatever they incur in judgment. If you kill a country or opponent financially, the chances of recovery are dim. It does not work to the benefit of the creditor or debtor. However, African countries are free games created to be taken advantage of.\nUnfortunately, these scams and fraudulent judgements against poor African countries are still active: facilitated by speculators on Broad and Wall Street in Europe, America or African cronies. This $9 Billion scheme was masterminded by a late Michael “Mick” Quinn (P&ID) Process and Industrial Developments Ltd Chairman. A conman saved from jail in Ireland by Prime Minister Albert Reynolds and the fear of Irish militia. He rose as a car mechanic to a billionaire scammer in business, law, sciences and arms dealing. Became African Consultant in Nigeria since the 70s.\nQuinn was charged with espionage and handling secret military materials, with his son Adam, a close associate from Ireland named James Nolan, three Nigerian officials, and three individuals from Israel, Romania, and Russia in October 2006. Another order came from the top as Ireland: that a case against Danjuma’s Consultant be dropped. The same month and year, Quinn formed P&ID and began exploring opportunities in gas flaring power he knew Nigeria needed for years.\nSimply put, faceless offshore companies of no known address, expertise or capability still sell arbitration judgments without authorized signatories to investors and speculators because international oil companies repeatedly refused to capture flaring gas. Nigeria is the victim here. Paid to change oil companies’ refusal to convert gas flare to energy: Quinn dared not sue them!\nNigeria tried persuasion, incentives, tax breaks, bribes, law and regulations to get oil companies to convert gas flaring to power and failed since the 70s. The same Lobbyist Quinn that was paid to lobby and convince International Oil companies to use their capable expertise to capture gas flaring from the oil they got, conspired with them for years to sabotage Nigeria’s need for gas fired electricity projects. Danjuma claimed he spent $40m for his idea. Haba, Allah dey O!\nQuinn that failed as paid Consultant and Lobbyist to convince oil companies, turned around and sue Nigeria! The con master himself admitted in court; it was the oil companies that abandoned gas flaring capture, but would not dare sue them! When Africans tried to use the International courts outside Africa to right injustice perpetrated on Africans on slavery or recent gas flaring of oil devastation in Niger Delta, chiefs and fishermen got stonewalled as contributing factors.\nOdious contracts are not new in developing countries, especially in African countries. What is new are courts of any jurisdiction outside Africa backing reckless and unfulfilled contracts. Since 2013, Quinn and partners decided that enforcing arbitration judgments in Nigeria’s court was unproductive, they must go outside Nigeria, ideally to London. If foreign companies failed to secure bids; Quinn would clone, usurp or sell the bids to obtain judgment as breach of contracts.\nThey use foreign rule of law and courts to bankrupt Africa again and again. The company P&ID that got this enormous amount of money judgment has no fixed address or place of operation except as an off-shore shell corporation of a subsidiary of another company that was part of a global equity firm and speculators. If you are wondering now, this is how crooks do business in order to deny people, all governments of taxes and cannot be held responsible or accountable.\nSounds familiar? It is like the colonialists establishing business Neo-Colonialism so that they are not held responsible for their economic exploitation. Even when their contracts look sincere as in the case of Enron, by the time suspicious countries in Asia and Africa tried to back out, it was too late. After all, they had the full weight of the American Presidents: Bush and Clinton with threats of denial of foreign aids as consequences. Cases in point: India and Mozambique .\nThe study of odious loans and contracts have demonstrated that African countries are duped into inflated contracts by both foreign companies and the politicians holding our countries into perpetual debts. As Nano Silver was a scam during Ebola crisis; HIV test kit production factory failed because politicians wanted foreign bribes on imported kits. So was our famous case of $13 billion Paris Club debt; despite International communities’ pleas of too heavy a burden on us.\nThe Odious court judgment was a contract that was no different from the odious loans. These are con men from all sides negotiating foreign loans and contracts for the benefit of their personal pockets. In most cases without adding substantive values to the infrastructure or economy of the recipient African countries. They all follow the same pattern since they know African politicians would latch onto any foreign contract for a cut into their pockets.\nIronically, both European and American governments have taken it upon themselves to warn Africans about excessive Chinese debts from many of the loans signed for infrastructure. The reason African governments, approach and take Chinese loans is because of the more favorable terms in the contracts. The Chinese know the interest rates on Western loans and they always come up with a lower rate, even when African countries cannot afford to pay back.\nHowever, developing countries are perpetual debtors and most remain so for life in order for rich countries to feed on them for survival. The simplest example is that of the farm workers and serf that kept on working for farm owners and owing more, no matter how long they pay back. They may even take out loans to buy provisions from the farm owners’ stores. In order to soften or relieve some of the loans, wives and kids are employed into the same vicious circle.\nTaking your farm owners to court for relief is like asking to break your Visa or contracts you and your family had already signed. This is the case with developing countries. Some Asian countries have broken out of this circumstance by revolt, renegotiation, cancellation, forgiveness or outright renege on some of the contracts. China is now showing the same pattern of excessive inflated contracts. So, India renegotiated their contract with China recently on that point.\nEven the $6.6 billion original judgment was more than three times its original estimate of losses as the $9 billion debt is growing by more than $1 million a day, because of interest. This court judgment of $9 billion is so out of place and not congenial to the financial health of Nigeria, it would set the country back many years. Indeed, Nigeria like most African countries is still suffering from the enormous debts t aking up almost all their yearly budgets .\nApologists of crime culture must be held accountable by international law enforcement agencies like FBI and Interpol to accept their responsibilities for the big boys they nurtured worldwide. Until then, Africa will remain their slave market. We then wonder why Lumumba, Nyerere, Nkrumah, Mugabe and Awolowo failed to complete their missions in each country. All the projects that were to be implemented to give African countries economic Independence were sabotaged for obscene profits by the very same foreign consultant experts we relied on.\nBut Fraud Upon The Court proving chicanery can save Africa.

While the President may have accurately recounted parts of our democratic journey’s history, it is evident that he has been misinformed regarding the outcome of the wage negotiation process.\n“To quote Mr. President; “As we continue to reform the economy, I shall always listen to the people and will never turn my back on you. In this spirit, we have negotiated in good faith and with open arms with organized labour on a new national minimum wage. We shall soon send an executive bill to the National Assembly to enshrine what has been agreed upon as part of our law for the next five years or less.\nIn the face of labour’s call for a national strike, we did not seek to oppress or crack down on the workers as a dictatorial government would have done. We chose the path of cooperation over conflict. No one was arrested or threatened. Instead, the labour leadership was invited to break bread and negotiate toward a good-faith resolution”\n“We appreciate the President’s commitment to those fine democratic ideals which allowed the work of the Tripartite National Minimum Wage Negotiation Committee to proceed unhindered despite some hiccups. However, we had expected Mr. President to have used this understanding as one of those who was in the vanguard of the struggle with us around the nation to rescue Nigeria from the hands of the military to harmonize the two figures submitted to him by the Tripartite Committee in favour of workers and masses. It would have been a fitting Democracy Day gift.\n“The NLC would have expected that the advisers of the President would have told him that we neither reached any agreement with the federal government and the employers on the base figure for a National Minimum Wage nor on its other components. Our demand still remains N250,000 (two hundred and fifty thousand Naira) only and we have not been given any compelling reasons to change this position which we consider a great concession by Nigerian workers during the tripartite negotiation process.\n“We are therefore surprised at the submission of Mr. Presidentover a supposed agreement. We believe that he may have been misled into believing that there was an agreement with the NLC and TUC. There was none and it is important that we let the President, Nigerians and other national stakeholders understand this immediately to avoid a mix up in the ongoing conversation around the national minimum wage. We have also not seen a copy of the document submitted to him and will not accept any doctored document.\n“However, we want to reaffirm our belief that the President on whose table the Tripartite Committee’s report presently resides would prepare an Executive Bill which content will reflect the true demand of Nigerian workers. We think that this is an opportunity for him to demonstrate his love for Nigerian workers and masses by shunning the pieces of advice that may be coming from those whose intentions are continuously focused on hurting the poor and struggling workers of Nigeria. Mr. President should not allow these individuals and groups to sabotage his promise of lifting Nigerian workers out of poverty.\n“President’s advisers obviously did not tell him the truth that the leaders of the trade unions were intimidated and harassed. It is therefore important that Mr. President understands that we were threatened severally by his operatives perhaps without his consent. Series of media Propaganda calculated to intimidate and harass us were, and, are still being waged against the trade unions by senior officials of this government. Fully armed soldiers surrounded us while we were in a negotiation with the Government and despite denials; recent statements by senior officials of the Government reaffirmed our fears contrary to the assurances by the Government. However, we remain assured that the President’s democratic credentials will come to the fore in favour of Nigerian workers and masses.\n“It is also important that Mr. President should know that most of his officers are working round the clock to set up the leadership of congress and the trade unions. We never agreed on a 5-year duration of the minimum wage Act though we acknowledge that the President mentioned 5 years or less. We also agreed that inflation should be pegged at a level for certain amount to be agreed as minimum wage. This is to bring clarity to what the report should contain.\nOnce again, we reiterate that it will be extremely difficult for Nigerian workers to accept any national minimum wage figure that approximates to a starvation Wage. We cannot be working and yet remain in abject poverty. We seek justice, equity and fairness for all Nigerians and this we hope would also drive the actions of Mr. President who promised a Living Wage to Nigerian workers. This is an opportunity to show that he listens to Nigerians as he promised!\nTogether, we can build a stronger democratic nation based on equity which guarantees prosperity to the majority of the citizenry and not one where few individuals monopolize our collective resources. That is the only way to build a sustainable democracy. It is the true democracy that we all yearn for as a people!\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"https://www.vanguardngr.com/2024/06/breaking-labour-rejects-tinubus-claims-of-agreement-on-new-minimum-wage/","2":"1366","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999885559"},{"0":"The House of Representatives on Wednesday accused the Justice Minister, Mohammed Bello-Adoke of draining the Nigerian economy through the payments of judgement debt and other legal settlements.\nAccording to the lawmakers the sum of N14 billion has already been lost through the justice ministry.\nThe government’s judgment debt profile presently is above N90 billion.\nThe lawmakers therefore mandated its committee on Justice to investigate the accumulation and payments of judgment debts by Federal Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs).\nThe House directed the Justice Committee to carry out a thorough investigation into questionable lawsuits that has accumulated more than N90 billion judgment debt against the federal government and report back in 21 days.\nThe House also called on President Goodluck Jonathan to suspend the payment of judgment claim to Interstella Communications Limited, and other payments pending the outcome of the investigations.\nThe decision followed a motion on the matter raised by Robinson Uwak (PDP, Akwa Ibom), who expressed concern that the office of the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) and Minister of Justice has been “wittingly or unwittingly encouraging the procurement of judgment debts against the Federal Government, thus the need to verify the processes.”\n“The Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice has a duty of representing the government of Nigeria and protecting fully, its pecuniary and other interests,” Mr Uwak said.\n“This must be in all contractual transactions, including litigations brought against it by parties,” he said.\nThe lawmakers suspect there may be a scheme that has been in existence for years in which some government officials instigate suits that exploited government’s weak structures and then shared in the proceeds of the claims.\nWhile moving the motion to constitute a committee to probe the matter, Mr Uwak accused the Office of the Attorney General of encouraging judgment debts against the government through negligent prosecution.\nHe cited the case of the AGF’s decision to commence payment of over N14 billion in judgment debts to a telecommunication company while the case remained in court.\nThe suit, between Interstella Communication Limited and NITEL, is currently before the Court of Appeal.

Hard to believe, it was, indeed, Buhari making a statement so totally untrue as to embarrass me as a citizen of this country. Granted, “You cannot adopt politics as a profession and remain honest” (LM Howe, 1871-1936, VBQ p 192). But, certainly, there must be some lies that are too unbelievable that no politician, let alone a President, should not tell. I don’t care who that person is; but anybody who says “there was no road” between Lagos and Ibadan before 2015 is lying. I have lived in Lagos and Ibadan since 1984; and there was never any time I trekked from one place to the other. Nobody, no matter how highly placed, especially someone who spent all those years in rural Daura, can tell me that I drove on grass and mud all those years. In fact, the people of the South-West were already driving on well-paved roads when Daura was still a wilderness. We didn’t need anyone from there to build roads for us.\nLYING AGAINST PREDECESSORS\nThe statement, as it stands, is actually a defamation of previous Heads of State, military and civilian, and rather than diminishing his predecessors, it was actually a poor reflection on Buhari. To be candid, hereafter, I will find it difficult to believe anything Buhari says. For over 30 years, I was on that road, at least, twice a week. One four occasions, I actually went up and down the road twice in one day. I can claim to be an authority on the condition of the road for decades.\nFISH ROTS FROM THE HEAD\n“An institution is the lengthened shadow of one man” – Ralph Waldo Emerson, 1803-1882, VANGUARD BOOK OF QUOTATIONS, VBQ, p 105.\nUntil now, I have been wondering why government spokesmen find it so easy to dissemble on factual matters ( e.g. the President is hale and hearty; this government has delivered 200 times power than what we inherited, etc) without any word of caution from above or embarrassment on their part. Now I know. They all work for a boss who actually approves of such conduct; one who does not allow facts to get in the way of fiction – if falsehood would serve his purpose.\nThis one, which will not be the last, joins a growing list of such statements made by Buhari which, after being fact-checked, turn out not to be so. A few Nigerians, with retentive memories, would recall the declaration last year that the FG had the list of 10 million people taken out of poverty. A few days after, the Director in charge of documenting the list of recipients of N5, 000 per month confessed that he was just embarking on developing the list.\nFurthermore, a little understanding of arithmetic should have shown our President that N5, 000 per month or N167 per day will never lift anybody out of extreme poverty. In reality, it actually encourages people to wallow in poverty while pretending to assist them.\nBut, poverty is not my reason for writing today. My objectives are two. First, is to advise President Buhari to stop uttering statements like the one under reference. Second, is to set the record straight briefly.\nBRIEF HISTORY OF THE LAGOS-IBADAN ROADS\nI will be 78 in a few months. I took my first trip from Lagos to Ibadan in 1956 – at the age of 12. There were two Trunk A roads leading from Lagos to Ibadan. One went through Ikorodu, Shagamu, Iperu, Alomaja and ended at the present Ring Road at Ibadan – before public transporters went to Ogunpa Motor Park. The second passed through Mushin, Oshodi, Agege, Sango-Ota, Ifo, Papalanto, Abeokuta and proceeded to Ibadan to burst out at Apata and continue to Mokola and University of Ibadan. They were both single lane roads; but tarred.\nThe first expressway in Nigeria was planned and executed by the Gowon administration – with Alhaji Femi Okunnu as Federal Commissioner of Works. The 120-kilometre dual carriageway which included three toll gates – Ikeja, Ogere and Ibadan – was the first of its kind in Nigeria. Buhari was actually in government when the road was opened for use. Could it be old age which made him to forget that even if SW people were trekking before the expressway was opened in 1975, we certainly stopped trekking after that?\nTen per cent of the toll collection was meant for the continuous repairs and maintenance of the road. Unfortunately, Gowon’s successors, including Buhari (1984-5), failed to maintain the road.\nFurthermore, as early as the mid-1980s, it was clear that the road was carrying a heavier load than that for which it was designed. It needed to be totally rebuilt. The road gradually fell apart and a series of death traps developed. But, there was still a road.\nThe late President Yar’Adua started the current effort to upgrade the road in 2009. Jonathan continued and close to 50 per cent was already completed by 2015. So, it is absurd for any President coming into office after 2015 to claim credit for the work done before him. It is absolutely dishonest to say “there was no road”.\n‘Buhari ignorant of S’West infrastructural problems – Afenifere’\nBy May this year, the Buhari administration would have spent seven years without completing a project half-finished by his predecessor. Instead of admitting failure, the President is attempting to re-write the history of the South-West. I totally agree with Afenifere. I will even go further.\n“You can’t bully reality”.\nAs a further demonstration of his ignorance, Buhari mentioned the Lagos-Ibadan rail service. Apart from the “joy ride” he was given, Buhari knows nothing more about the rail service. I know more; because I went on the train with eyes wide open and took pictures.\nUnless they have increased the trips, by late last year, only one trip a day was available to and fro. The maximum number of passengers could not have exceeded 4, 000 people. Yet, over 1, 000, 000 people are on the Lagos-Ibadan road everyday.\nJOKES OF THE MONTH\n‘Russian-Ukraine war: FG to evacuate Nigerians from Ukraine – Onyeama’\nMr Geoffrey Onyeama is Nigeria’s Foreign Affairs Minister. When several serious governments were evacuating their citizens, NFG did nothing. Now they promise to evacuate Nigerians after all airports are closed, most Nigerians have fled and are scattered. Don’t laugh please!\n‘Why military is reluctant to wipe out bandits — El-Rufai’\nThe Kaduna State Governor went on to disclose to reporters that “preliminary investigations implicated some police, military personnel.” So, we are sending bandits to wipe out their friends. Don’t laugh!!!\n‘FAAC shares N574.668bn among FG, states, LGs’\nI have said it repeatedly; Nigerian most states will be totally bankrupt by the time Buhari leaves office in 2023. The amount shared last month represents the second time the three tiers of government would share less than N600bn in a month. The last was under Buhari in 2016. The one before it was in 2010 under President Yar’Adua. By December this year, public servants in most states will be in revolt.\nYOU WILL PAY MORE FOR FUEL\nTake it from me; you will pay more for fuel than you expect. Buhari, who shifted subsidy removal 18 months, is not an economist. And, he is surrounded by people who lack the courage to tell him the truth. With crude oil now over $120/barrel, Nigeria will be spending more than her crude oil revenue to pay for refined products. Then we will discover that nobody wants to lend us money abroad. Exchange rate will skyrocket…\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"https://www.vanguardngr.com/2018/09/restructuring-tanko-yakkasai-wrong-to-say-uniformed-igbo-re-championing-yourba-agenda-prof-abc-nwosu/Haba","2":"1882","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999923706"},{"0":"… Plans To Shoot Next Video in Tokyo and Jamaica.\nWith just a few weeks to the release of his sophomore album, “Baddest”, multiple award winning popstar, Davido is set to premiere five fresh videos off his first album, OBO Genesis on Africa’s biggest music channel, MTV Base.\nThe videos which include, New Skul Tinz featuring label mates, Sina Rambo and B-Red, Bless Me featuring May D, Dollars in The Bank featuring Kayswitch, Video and MaryJane are all unreleased videos from his debut album, OBO and will air on MTV Base’ show tagged, Davido Exposed on Saturday, October 10, 2015.\nDavido who speaks about all five videos on the exclusive show reveals that “New Skul Tins” is his least liked video and he would have loved to re-enact the Michael Jackson concept for “MaryJane”.

Boyland Jr. was hit by gunfire in Brooklyn on Wednesday evening as he rode with his 7-year-old son, a police spokeswoman said.\nNeither Mr. Boyland nor his son was injured, said the spokeswoman, Deputy Inspector Kim Royster of the New York Police Department.\nInspector Royster said Wednesday night that investigators did not believe that Mr. Boyland, a four-term assemblyman who represents the 55th Assembly District in Brooklyn, was the intended target of the shooting, which occurred in his district. She said it appeared to be “a random shooting.”\n“It doesn’t seem they were aiming at the vehicle,” Inspector Royster said.\nThe shooting occurred about 6 p.m. while Mr. Boyland, who was returning from a barber shop, was driving near the intersection of Saratoga and Sutter Avenues in Brownsville, the authorities said. After hearing several shots ring out, Mr. Boyland pulled over and called the police, Inspector Royster said, adding that initially, Mr. Boyland, 40, did not know that the vehicle he was driving, a 2009 G.M.C., had been struck.\nBut he soon realized that his back window had been shattered, Inspector Royster said. Investigators recovered a bullet lodged in one of the front seats, Inspector Royster said.\nIt is not immediately known what the other shots, which did not strike the vehicle, hit, Inspector Royster said.\nMr. Boyland did not see who fired the shots, Inspector Royster said, and it was not immediately known whether there were other witnesses to the shooting. As of late Wednesday night, detectives did not have a description of the gunman or gunmen, but were canvassing the area, she said.\nMr. Boyland was indicted in March in a bribery and corruption scandal along with others, including State Senator Carl Kruger of Brooklyn.\nMr. Boyland pleaded not guilty to charges that he accepted money as a consultant in return for his influence in Albany on behalf of MediSys Health Network. (Mr. Boyland and others ensnared in the scandal are to go to trial in early 2012 and later this year.)\nIn late May, the Legislative Ethics Commission issued a finding that Mr. Boyland may have violated state ethics law by working as a paid consultant for Brookdale University Hospital and Medical Center while advocating on its behalf.\nMr. Boyland, who is known as Junior, is chairman of the Assembly Subcommittee on Senior Outreach and Activities and sits on the Housing, Economic Development, Local Government, Banking and Aging Committees, according to his Web site. His district, the 55th, includes the neighborhoods of Brownsville, Crown Heights, and part of East New York.\nAs an assemblyman, Mr. Boyland, who earns $79,500 annually, faced harsh criticism for his performance this year: he was absent for 20 of the 60 days the Assembly was in session, and did not introduce a single piece of legislation this session.\nHe is a native of Ocean Hill, Brooklyn. His father, William F. Boyland Sr., known as Frank, held the seat his son now holds for two decades, before retiring in 2002. His uncle Thomas S. Boyland was also a State Assembly member, and his sister, Tracy L. Boyland, was a member of the City Council.\nCouncilwoman Letitia James of Brooklyn, who called herself a close friend of Mr. Boyland, said that the shooting was “typical of the violence in Central Brooklyn, which is just out of hand.”\nMs. James said that she spoke to Mr. Boyland after the incident and that he said “he and his son were fine.”","1":"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/11/nyregion/gunshots-hit-vehicle-of-assemblyman-william-boyland-jr.html","2":"786","3":"Religion","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.999961853"},{"0":"Former heads of state, Generals Ibrahim Babangida and Muhammadu Buhari\nBy Wole Mosadomi\nMINNA—Nigeria’s former military president, General Ibrahim Babangida (ret), yesterday, endorsed the presidential aspiration of General Muhammadu Buhari, saying the All Progressives Congress, APC, presidential candidate was suitably positioned to salvage the country.\nBabangida who received Buhari in his Minna, Niger State residence also said the country’s retired generals would back Buhari being one of their own. He dismissed as fable, media insinuations of a feud between him and Buhari.\nBuhari’s visit to Babangida was on the fringes of his campaign to Minna which was climaxed with the defection of the incumbent Deputy Governor of the state, Ahmed Ibeto to the APC.\nExpressing his appreciation of Buhari’s unwavering commitment to service of the fatherland, during the visit to his Hill Top residence in Minna, General Babangida said: “You have beaten some of us in proving Gen. Douglas McArthur’s theory that “old soldiers never die but fade away gradually,” but you have refused to fade away.\n“I wish to congratulate members of the party for the honour of nominating my colleague, General Muhammadu Buhari as your presidential candidate in 2015 election”.\nDebunking media insinuations of an unending feud between himself and Buhari who he ousted as Head of State in 1985, Babangida said:\n“You media men have created this impression that we are fighting each other. Look at us here today; he knows what I mean and I know what he means. We both fought to keep Nigeria one when we were young majors then. We were well travelled.\n“I want to commend APC for choosing our colleague as your flag bearer. All of us will support you (Buhari) in this cause to salvage this country,” IBB stated.\nBuhari had before then explained to Babangida that he was in Minna to solicit votes towards realising his aspiration to again lead the country as a civilian president and expressed joy on the reception given him and his delegation by the former military president.\nBuhari said that he had earlier visited another former ruler, Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo who he said refused to decamp from the ruling Peoples Democratic Party, PDP but nevertheless gave his blessing to his aspiration.\nOn Buhari’s entourage were the national leader of the party, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu; the deputy national chairman of the APC, Senator Lawali Shuaibu; Director-General of the Buhari Campaign Organisation, Governor Rotimi Amaechi; party chieftains including Chief Audu Ogbeh, Chief Bisi Akande, Prince Olagunsoye Oyinlola, Mr. Segun Oni and Ms Temi Harriman.\nOthers are General Abdurahaman Dambazzau, Senator George Akume, Chief Niyi Adebayo, Senator Bukola Saraki, Alhaji Kawu Baraje and Chief Kemi Nelson among others.\nFollowing the courtesy call, Buhari addressed a large rally at the Polo Ground, Minna where he vowed that if successful in the election, he would wage a total war against insecurity in the country as he pledged to fully equip the military for the assignment.\nHe pledged that his administration would use the agricultural potentials of the state to an advantage and also promised that agriculture would be given the pride of place in his government.\nThe candidate urged those who turned out that the promises he was making would, however, only be realised “if the people go out to vote, peacefully stay behind and ensure that their votes count”.\nOsinbajo, Tinubu speak\nBefore Buhari spoke, his running mate, Professor Osinbajo had told the crowd that an APC government would frontally address the problems in the power sector saying: “We have to settle the problem in the power sector. We know the problem and we are going to find solution to the problem. We have the answer, Nigerians should give us chance by voting for APC come February 14, 2015.”\nAlso speaking, Tinubu, also the Jagaban Borgu in Niger State, flayed President Goodluck Jonathan as a man not to be trusted with his words. He said the president had promised not to vie for a second term before the 2011 elections.\n“President Jonathan in one African country in 2011 promised to spend only four years. He went further to say that if he can’t fix Nigeria in four years, he will not be able to succeed in 20 years, so why must we allow a man who failed to honour a promise he made four years ago?”\nHe described the Jonathan administration as a failure, saying the government could not count tangible achievements in six years.\nGovernor Amaechi in his address described the Jonathan administration as steeped in fraud. He dismissed last Sunday’s reduction in petrol price as a fraud as, according to him, the reduction was late and did not meet the reduction in global price of crude.\nThe rally was climaxed with the defection of the incumbent deputy governor of the state, Ahmed Musa Ibeto to the APC. Ibeto came along with 319 other PDP chieftains to APC.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"http://www.vanguardngr.com/2015/01/presidency-ibb-backs-buhari/#sthash.D8Oil4ZE.dpuf","2":"1181","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999504089"},{"0":"CHIEF OF ARMY STAFF (COAS), LT.-GEN.

Just intensify the oil exploration in the North-East. As for exportation from the Niger Delta, forget about it because the Nigerian government won’t export a drop from our land.\n“The NDA intelligence agency gathered that the said peace talk or dialogue by the Federal Government is a delay tactic employed by the government to enable the drones they ordered arrive latest end of August from the United States.\n“This whole thing makes us to wonder what kind of country this is.

Abiodun polled 241,670 votes to defeat Akinlade who had 222,153 votes.\nHe added that he had moved on because those who orchestrated the rigging had apologised to him.\nHis words: “During the last election, thank God, Chief Osoba is here, I have said it; we won convincingly. They rigged, rigged, and ended up with 19,000.\n“Some of them came to apologise to me. I can’t be mentioning names. We won that election. But I have moved on. We did our work; we will continue to do what we have to do. God will be with all of us.”\nSpeaking later on the sideline with journalists, Amosun declared that he was not in support of Abiodun’s administration, saying he must be removed.\nHe also assured his supporters that the next line of action would soon be made public.\n“Just wait; very soon, you will hear where we are going next. You know my stand, and my stand is my stand. I am not supporting this administration that is there now. He must be removed,” he said.\nAbiodun fires back\nReacting to Amosun’s claim, Abiodun, who spoke with journalists at the grand finale of the 50th anniversary of the Abeokuta Club, said he would not be distracted by any person who has a problem with self-delusion, assuring that he would rather focus on his mandate and not join issues with anyone who wants to play God.\n“I will not be distracted by any person or persons who have a problem with self-delusion. I will not be distracted by any person who does not appreciate that Ogun State is not anybody’s father’s inheritance. We are all stakeholders in this commonwealth called Ogun State.\n“I am not going to join issues with anyone that wants to play God; I will leave them to God. God can deal with whoever is challenging His authority and wanting to play God.\nAll I can say is that what we stand for in Ogun State is an administration that is committed to providing purposeful leadership and purposeful infrastructural development across the length and breadth of the state.\n“How can we on the outside take on an incumbent and then be accused of rigging out an incumbent in the same party? Anyone can explain their failure whichever way they like. Anyone can also begin to pant and threaten that they will do whatever,” he added.\nAmosun suffering from “political amnesia—Ogun APC\nEqually responding to Amosun’s claim, the APC in Ogun State, in a statement by its Publicity Secretary, Tunde Oladunjoye, said the former governor is suffering from “political amnesia and out-of-office loneliness”, thereby calling on the people of the state to pray for him.\nOladunjoye described Amosun’s claim as “an after-lunch belching of a man suffering from political amnesia and loneliness.”\nHe said: “The quoted statement was not only an insult to the psyche of the people of Ogun State but also a sad indication that the former governor is yet to purge himself of extreme arrogance and intolerance that were his trademarks, which earned him a suspension from our party, even as a sitting governor.\n“The APC, therefore, calls on the public, and particularly our esteemed members, to pity and pray for the former governor as he suffers from political amnesia, loneliness and absolute lack of touch with reality.\n“There is absolutely no truth in the specious utterance of the former governor who is still sulking from the electoral defeat of his surrogate party in 2019. Our party and candidate not only won fair and square but the victory of Prince Dapo Abiodun was also attested to by his co-contestants, many of whom later joined APC and are still in APC.\n“Having been witnessing the frustrating exodus of his former political allies who openly said they were tired of endemic lies; and his failure to wrest the party structures from the incumbent governor, the recourse by Senator Amosun to “elated” after-lunch belching is understandable and pitiable.”\nThe State Chairman of the party, Chief Yemi Sanusi said Amosun’s claim was unbecoming of a supposed statesman.\nSanusi, who spoke after a closed-door meeting with leaders of the party in the 20 local government areas of the state, called for disciplinary measures against such anti-party acts.\nSanusi, who was the acting chairman of the party in 2019, declared that the election that produced Governor Abiodun was the most credible in the history of the state.\nHe said, the electorate overwhelmingly voted for Governor Abiodun and stood against any move to overturn their will.\nHe added that all subterranean schemes evolved by the then governor to ensure that his candidate won were thwarted by the vigilant and repressible people of Ogun State.\nHe said the party in the state might probe the rigging allegation raised by Amosun, noting that it was high time the anti-party activities of the senator were investigated.\nAlso, reacting to Amosun’s allegation, a former Minister of Communication and a chieftain of the APC, Mr Adebayo Shittu, called on the National Working Committee, NWC, of the party to sanction Amosun for anti-party activities.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"https://www.vanguardngr.com/2022/08/war-in-ogun-apc-abiodun-amosun-flex-muscle/","2":"1402","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999923706"},{"0":"Ex-finance Minister Iweala loses dad\nFormer Finance Minister, Dr. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, has lost her father, Obi (Prof) Chukwuka Okonjo, Obi of Ogwashi Uku, Aniocha South L.G.A, Delta State.\nHis Royal Majesty Obi (Prof) Chukuka Okonjo died at the age of 91 in the United States of America.\nThe late monarch, who was a professor of mathematics, ascended the throne of his ancestors in 2007.\nFollowing the completion of traditional rites, a new monarch has been crowned.\nThe new monarch, Ifechukwude Chukuka Okonjo, is a financial management expert and CEO of Chevy Chase Consulting.\nThe processes include the new Obi’s endorsement and presentation by the Umu Obi Obahai Royal Family of Ogwashi-Uku and the traditional chalking and crowning ceremonies conducted by the Ikelike and Agidiehi Kingmakers in Ogwashi Uku.\nRead Also: Siasia’s mother’s 59 days in captivity\nThe new Obi, who also worked for Halliburton Nigeria, attended Federal Government College, Enugu.\nHe obtained his A’ levels as an external student of the University of London before proceeding to United States of America where he bagged two degrees in Economics and History from University of Maryland, College Park and an MBA from University of Edinburgh, Scotland.\nHe is pursuing a doctorate in Business Administration from University of Paris, in France.\nA transformational minded leader with a deep and abiding love for his people, His Royal Majesty, ObiIfechukwude Chukuka Okonjo’s focus is to be a forward-looking and inclusive traditional ruler who will elevate his people by serving as a champion of translating progressive and practical ideas into action.","1":"https://thenationonlineng.net/ex-finance-minister-iweala-loses-dad/","2":"391","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9995633364"},{"0":"Leah Sharibu: Parents confirm voice\n… Her voice and Picture has rekindled our hope – Parents\nThe Parents of Leah Sharibu, the only girl still held captive by Boko Haram insurgents amongst other school girls abducted at Government Girls Science and Technical College Dapchi have confirmed the voice from an audio message from an Online publication, The Cable as that of Leah, their daughter.\nThe Nation reports that Leah Sheribu’s audio message was published by The Cable online news platform with her recent picture wearing a brown hijab dress.\nIn the message, Leah made an appeal for her release from Boko Haram captivity.\nThe audio is translated thus:\nI am Leah Sharibu, the girl that was abducted in GGSS Dapchi.

Some months back, two couples were asked about their mismatched libidos, and how it affected their marriage.\nWhile one partner claimed to be pretty much always in the mood, the other often felt pressured to have sex when they had little desire to do so. The challenge? For one month, the couples agreed they’d make love every time their partner made an advance. Would this highlight cracks in their relationship—or bring them closer together? Both couples kept diaries for four weeks.\nCOUPLE 1: Nathaniel, 38 an architect, and wife, Motoke, 40, an industrial nurse have been married for 12 years and have three children. While Nathaniel would like sex every night, Motoke says juggling work and family has sapped her libido, meaning she’s only in the mood a couple of times a month. Their score: Week 1: twice; Week 2: once, Week 3: once; Week 4: twice. Total: Six times in four weeks.\nAccording to Nathaniel: I’m so excited at the prospect of being able to make love to my wife more often that, on the first night, even though I’m shattered after 12 hours at work, my heart is racing as we climb into bed at 10.30pm; even more thrilling, Motoke actually makes the first move—I cannot remember the last time that happened.\nI spend all the next day fantasising about what will happen later, but after a couple of glasses of wine, we both collapsed into bed and fell asleep. I’m too tired to mind. Sex is then off the agenda for a few days as it was Motoke’s ‘time of the month’, but then she actually asks if we can go to bed. You bet!\nThe next week doesn’t start well. I wake up in the mood when the alarm goes off at 6.30 am, but Motoke grumbles that she wants to go back to sleep as my snoring has been keeping her awake. It seems like we’re back to our old ways. The following evening, I pick up a meal from our favourite eatery hoping a romantic dinner might relax her. Later, she’s happy to cuddle but while I try to initiate love-making she’s clearly tired and things don’t go any further.\nA couple of days later, we go to bed early, at Motoke’s suggestion, ostensibly to watch TV, but a goodnight kiss turns into a passionate embrace, and we make love. The following night, Motoke climbs into bed naked, and is clearly ‘in the mood’ yet I feel so exhausted. Wow! This is the first time in our married life that I’ve turned her down. It gives me an insight into how Motoke must feel all those times I’ve been in the mood and she hasn’t.\nThe next two nights, Motoke is out with family friends but on Saturday evening she tells me we’re definitely on for tonight. I don’t even have to ask—fantastic. But at the beginning of the third week, while hurriedly ironing my shirt for work I somehow manage to catch my ‘manhood’ with the iron —a lesson never to iron until you’re fully dressed. I can’t even think about sex over the next couple of days—Motoke appears relieved and amused. Three days later, we try again but unfortunately I’m still too sore. I suspect Motoke is a little frustrated, and that feels great after years of pestering her for sex.\nWe finally make love a week after the iron incident. Abstinence seems to have boosted our sexual appetites, and two nights later, we’re at it again. Keeping a diary has been great for putting sex at the forefront of our minds and not allowing it to slip off our busy agendas. I love feeling close to my wife and, best of all, knowing that she now actively wants to make love to me, rather than just doing it to appease me. It‘s made us a lot more playful too, which is great as it doesn’t always happen in a long-standing marriage.\nMotoke says: I know there’s no way Nathaniel will pass up the opportunity on the first night —and I’m surprised it only lasts for 15 minutes. He was feeling tired. We decided to give it another go the following night but after a couple of drinks, sleep becomes a far more appealing prospect for both of us. I’m surprised he’s not taking greater advantage of the situation.\nPerhaps our libido aren’t as mismatched as I’ve always believed? But when I invite Nathaniel to join me in bed the next evening, his face lights up. Sex twice in one week is unheard of for us. The second week starts with me having a night away. Nathaniel is raring to go when I return. I’m tired but respond to his advances, because that’s what we’ve agreed and to my surprise, I really enjoyed it.\nThe following evening I’m feeling a bit frisky and wait for him in bed— naked. I’m astonished when he rejects me. I feel a little hurt — but this is how he has felt the countless times I’ve rejected him. We’re back on course by the end of the weekend. I seduce him in the living room by the dimmed lights of the TV. It’s very romantic. The enforced five-day abstinence after Nathaniel’s iron accident leaves me looking forward to our next love-making, and it’s wonderful, really reminiscent of when we first fell in love. I think it’s because having sex more regularly has brought us closer together.\nThis has really helped us reconnect, both physically and emotionally reminding us that we’re not just parents but also lovers. With all the demands of being a working mum it’s easy to lose sight of this, but I am determined not to allow sex to fall to the bottom of my ‘to-do list’ again.\nCOUPLE 2: Treasure 40, owner of a restaurant and Dipo 41, a legal practitioner have a 3-year-old daughter and an infant son.\nSEX SCORE: Week 1: three times; Week 2: five times; Week 3: twice; Week 4: Six times. Total 16 times in four weeks.\nAccording to Treasure: Our experiment doesn’t start well. While I spend the first day excited about the prospect of guaranteed sex, plans are ruined when our baby is awake from 10.30pm to 3am. then I’m up with our other child at 6.30am. The next evening, I’m not sure I’ll have the energy—but I start caressing Dipo and very quickly realise the answer is a resounding ‘Yes!’\nThe following night, he looks resigned when I start kissing him, though he seems to enjoy himself afterwards. The night after that, realising he might take some persuading, I slip into a silky nighties that usually works. It’s all very passionate, but I’m questioning whether it feels like a chore for my husband. At least when we make love normally, I know it’s what he really wants.\nHe works so hard on Sundays so he could get through his back-log of work that I let him off, then spend two nights with our baby who has tonsillitis. But once the baby’s antibiotics kick in, I’m back in the marital bed. While many women would want to catch up on sleep, sex actually gives me energy so we make love that night.\nThe following evening, we entertain friends for dinner and I can’t wait to rip his clothes off afterwards. The following two nights, I’m impatient for him to get home from work. I know he’s tired but I tell him love-making is a great way to unwind. But not having to work to get him into bed feels really strange—I’m missing the challenge.\nMy period slows things down a bit in week three. Then I come home from work to a grumpy husband and I know that propositioning him may make things worse—but, after going without for so long, I’m willing to take the risk so I start kissing him. It pays off. The sex is very passionate. As we enter the final week, I know I should feel happy that Dipo can’t refuse my advances, but I’m realising our love-life is not as exciting as it was—I miss the chase. This experiment has made me realise how much I enjoy the excitement of not knowing whether Dipo will or won’t succumb to my seduction techniques. Perhaps it wasn’t so bad before.\nDIPO SAYS: I haven’t been looking forward to this month. I always enjoy sex but some nights, I’d rather relax in front of the TV. Of course I oblige under the terms of our experiment, but after the first few nights, I feel a bit like a performing dog. To say I’m relieved when Treasure doesn’t make any advances—the following night is huge understatement. But when she has to stay up with the baby, I’m surprisingly disappointed not to be cuddling up with her in bed.\nOnce the baby is better, my wife is back on form. It’s not easy getting in the mood on nights when all I want to do is sleep, and I even contemplate faking a headache. When she tells me it’s her ‘time of the month’ the following week, I feel as happy as if she’s told me we’d won the lottery!\nLike most men, once I get going, I really enjoy it but I don’t like feeling pressured and, with a demanding job and two babies, sleep is sometimes more appealing. Once she’s able to make love again I don’t give in too easily. Work has been challenging, and so are the children, so I’m not in a great mood when my wife starts whispering suggestive things into my ear. However, I’m glad she made the first move because what follows proves to be a great stress-reliever.\nAll the same, I’m glad when I get to the final week. Not being able to say ‘No’ to sex is beginning to stress me out — I feel a loss of control not knowing when I’m going to be asked to perform. It’s a relief when the challenge ends. Sex should be fun, not a chore. Now I’m going to make her wait a whole week before making love to her again.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"https://www.vanguardngr.com/2022/07/2023-im-offering-peter-obi-golden-opportunity-to-be-my-vp-kwankwaso/amp/Must","2":"2392","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.999994278"},{"0":"By Dapo Akinrefon & Luminous Jannamike, ABUJA\nOpposition against the Muslim-Muslim ticket of the All Progressives Congress, APC, yesterday, grew as the Forum of Northern Christians reiterated its position on the same-faith ticket, saying it would not back down.\nThe forum is headed by the former Speaker of the House of Representatives, Mr. Yakubu Dogara.\nBut a top APC leader tackled Dogara, describing him as a fifth columnist.\nBola Tinubu, a Muslim emerged as the presidential candidate of the APC for the 2023 elections, while former governor of Borno State, Kashim Shettima, emerged as his running mate.\nThis came on a day Governor of Delta State and Vice Presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, Dr. Ifeanyi Okowa, yesterday, took a swipe at Bola Tinubu, over the controversy that has trailed the party’s Muslim-Muslim ticket.\nOur position on same-faith ticket stands Dogara, however, said it will meet with all the presidential candidates, across party lines and come up with its preferred choice.\nDogara met behind closed doors with Christian leaders from the 19 Northern states and the Federal Capital Territory, FCT, in Abuja in continuation of their consultations ahead of the 2023 general elections.\nIt was gathered that aside the former speaker, others in attendance include former Secretary to the Government of the Federation, SGF, Mr Babachir Lawal; an APC Senator from Adamawa State, Elisha Abbo; former Kogi State Deputy Governor, Simon Achuba and all state chairmen of the Christian Association of Nigeria, CAN, from the 19 Northern states and the Federal Capital Territory.\nConfirming the meeting in a tweet posted on his verified Twitter account, yesterday, Dogara wrote: “#NigeriaDecides2023: The fight for justice continues.

The party leader, who spoke to Vanguard in confidence, also tackled Dogara and former SGF, Mr Babachir Lawal describing them as paperweight politicians.\nThe source, who is familiar with the workings of the APC, said: “Dogara is a spent force. He was looking for the VP slot, as far as we are concerned, Dogara and Babachir Lawal just want to be noticed. Based on my understanding of how politics is played in the north, the likes of Dogara and Lawal are paperweight politicians as far as northern politics is concerned and also within the Christian community.\n“During the last elections, what did they bring to the table from their various local governments? How many people can Babachir Lawal convince to vote for him in Adamawa State? How many people can Dogara convince to vote for others in Bauchi? Dogara is a minority in his state but in spite of that, Muslims supported him to become Speaker of the House of Representatives.\n“They are fifth columnists as far as we are concerned. I see it as an attempt to demystify the myth around religious politics in Nigeria because an average Nigerian is not bothered about where you come from as long as you give him the basic needs. Look at the Vice President, how has his Vice Presidency benefitted any Christian in Nigeria?\nThe thing is staring them in the face that Bola Tinubu will win in 2023 and that is why they are looking for a way to thwart his victory.\nI don’t believe in playing politics with religion, Okowa slams Tinubu, Obi\nMeanwhile, Governor Okowa tackled Tinubu and the presidential candidate of the Labour Party, LP, Mr Peter Obi, over their recent utterances, saying he does not believe in playing politics with religion..\nHe said this during the Northern Christian Youth Assembly Summit in Abuja.\nThe governor also condemned the idea of cyber-bullying by supporters of other presidential candidates, which he said won’t stop him from speaking the truth about the situation in the country.\nHis words: “I do not believe in the Muslim-Muslim ticket. The reason is that there is a diversity when it comes to that. Therefore, sticking to one faith is not a good thing to do particularly in a troubled nation as we are in today. It’s almost like going on to having the presidential candidate pick his vice presidential candidate from the north and picking the Vice Presidential candidate also from the North.\n“So, the only ticket that can work for our Nigeria is the ticket that is not trying to build itself to election victory to either the Muslim or Christian faith. “PDP will win the election because many people have keyed into this project. We are receiving decampees in droves.\n“When we talk about the future is for the youths, yes it is from today but the truth is that our youths, particularly youths leaders, must be in a position to have a clear understanding so that they can guide others aright.”\nOn alleged cyber-bullying by supporters of other political parties, Okowa said: “I did not speak up my mind to look down on anybody. But the truth is that Nigeria is so divided. Nigeria is insecure. We are going to see bullying in cyberspace in our country. I think that everybody should have the space and time to be able to think and make comments without being bullied. We need to do critical thinking and that is why we are gathered here today.”\nLamenting the myriad challenges rocking the nation as Nigerians prepare to elect a new set of leaders in 2023, the Delta governor said: “The situation in this country is very bad. Sometimes we do not understand how bad it is. But I know that it is not irredeemable.\n“The former Vice-President (Atiku) and I working with the party and working with Nigerians, believe that we can begin the rebuilding process but first we have to be able to rescue the nation by winning the elections.\n“The economy is so bad, that the education and the health system are so bad. We are crying for devolution of power, and in all these challenges, you don’t bring somebody who wants to learn on the job. Because if you do, so you drop him on the seat, and he gets overwhelmed by the challenges on the ground. We don’t want to return to 2015.”\nWhy Atiku picked Okowa as running mate over Wike, others — Ayu\nAlso speaking, the National Chairman of the PDP, Senator Iyorchia Ayu, explained that the party’s presidential candidate, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, picked Governor Okowa as his running mate above his Rivers counterpart, Nyesom Wike, and other nominees presented to him because of his (Okowa’s) humility and excellent performance in office.\nAyu said: “We looked around and we thought we have to give not just a vice president that will assist him (Atiku) but we did our homework to select a man, who is highly educated, very humble, and who has done very well as a governor in his home state.\n“Okowa is the most qualified running mate. It is on his merit that he was selected by the party as the vice presidential candidate for Atiku Abubakar. I think Nigeria will be very lucky to have two such people who are committed to the development, who are detribalized and who believe in uniting this country.”\nThe PDP chairman, however, urged Nigerians to be wary of the APC, saying the ruling party performed poorly because they lacked a clear blueprint to turn around the fortunes of the country.\nHe said: “Even if APC were to come back tomorrow and give you a Muslim-Christian ticket, your fate will be worse because they have no programme.\n“We have a president who is a Muslim, a vice president, who is a Christian, but they are not sensitive to the needs of the vast majority of the population.\n“We have about 28 ministers in the Northern part of the country. I think only two Christians, the rest 26 Muslims, or that. Is that not insensitive? The vice president, per se, cannot do everything.\n“Today, we are borrowing to pay salaries because of the mismanagement that has befallen this country. We have never had a situation where the security situation was so bad. I believe we can salvage this country. This country is drifting very dangerously. We can’t allow it to disintegrate.”\nUrging Christian youths to take active part in the political activities leading to the 2023 elections, Ayu said: “What you are doing is a service to humanity. If you give them (Atiku and Okowa) your support and you mobilise the rest of the Nigerians to support, I believe we can salvage this country and make a difference.\n“As a Christian, I want to say that we believe a lot in prayer, but over the years, we also know that, if you pray and you don’t work, I don’t think God will just come down and make things happen. You need to act. And so why do we pray? We try as much as possible to act in a way that God will help us.”\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"https://www.vanguardngr.com/2022/09/no-going-back-on-opposition-to-same-faith-ticket-forum-of-northern-christians/amp/","2":"2301","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999847412"},{"0":"The Federal Government has said that it will stop the payment of fuel subsidy by the end of June 2023.\nThe Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Mrs Zainab Ahmed, disclosed this during the public presentation of the 2023 Federal Government budget.\nMrs Zainab disclosed that in the 2023 fiscal period, the government has made provisions of N3. 36trillion naira for fuel subsidy payment to cover the first six months of this year.\nThis, she stated, is in line with the 18-month extension announced in early 2022.\nREAD ALSO: Presidential Election: Obi Leads Atiku, Tinubu, Kwankwaso In Fresh Survey\nBreaking down the budget, the minister noted that the nation’s revenue performance as at November 2022 stood at 6. 5 trillion naira, representing an 87 percent of the set target of 7. 8 trillion naira for the year.\nAn analysis of the key contributors to the revenue collection according to the minister of finance and planning, includes a N586billion collection from the Federal Government, Customs – N15billion, independent revenue collection N1.3trillion as well as a N3.7trillion collection from other sources of revenue.\nTop sectors that contributed to the growth of the economy in 2022 includes Agriculture at 23 percent, information and communications technology, trade, manufacturing with the oil and gas sector contributing just about 5. 6 percent.\nThe depreciation in the contribution of the oil and gas sector to the economy according to the minister represents the government’s resolve to diversify the economy.\nAs regards tax waivers, the minister of finance announced the withdrawal of the pioneer status tax waiver for companies going forward.\nShe stated that a total of N6trillion had been forgone between 2021 to date under its tax waiver scheme.\nThe plan according to her, will help shore up the federal government’s revenue.","1":"https://www.channelstv.com/2023/01/04/fg-to-stop-payment-of-fuel-subsidy-by-end-of-june-2023/","2":"395","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999599457"},{"0":"By Julie Coker\nMy girlfriend doesn’t like condoms. She prefers sex naturally without any artificiality. We have begun having sex recently. The first few times we did, we used condoms. But she doesn’t feel good with it. She said she prefers to feel me. Lately, we stopped using it. I always pull out before I come. Is this still safe? Is it safe to re-enter after this? I will appreciate all the help. Thanks.\nI want to understand the problem here. Is it sexually transmitted infections (STIs), pregnancy, or both? In the case of STIs, the answer is a resounding NO! Pulling out, or withdrawal, isn’t an effective method of STI prevention because most disease-causing microorganisms don’t depend on ejaculation for transmission. A condom will only help prevent the spread of STIs if you put it on before sex and leave it on the entire time you are having sex.\nIf both of you have been tested before you started having sex with each other, you may not be concerned about STIs. If you haven’t been tested you may want to consider doing so.\nAs a primary means of pregnancy prevention, withdrawal has several disadvantages. First, there’s the pre-ejaculatory fluid on which the withdrawal method has no effect since it’s released well before you ejaculate. Pre-ejaculate itself doesn’t contain sperm, however it may pick up sperm left in the urethra from a previous ejaculation, and thus, re-inserting your penis after ejaculation (outside of the vagina) does present a risk of pregnancy. Next, and what perhaps has even more of an impact on the effectiveness of the method, is the issue of consistency and self-control. Can you use the withdrawal method correctly and consistently each time you have sex? If not, then you might want to think about whether this method is right for you. Of course, you do have the option of emergency contraception.\nWithdrawal does have its advantages. It’s free and always available. Second, no side effects are associated with this form of contraception. The estimated failure rate for typical use is around 22 percent. When practiced perfectly, the failure rate is estimated to be around 4 percent. This means 4 to 22 women out of every 100 who use withdrawal as their contraceptive method get pregnant.\nIf you haven’t already, perhaps you and your girlfriend could talk about your concerns and work toward reaching a mutual decision on what form of contraception and/or safer sex you both want to use. Besides the issue of STIs, it’s best to talk about how willing you are to risk having to deal with a pregnancy and what either of you would do if a pregnancy occurred. Withdrawal is definitely less effective than, say, the birth control pill. But, if both of you are okay and comfortable with the risk involved, then you may decide that withdrawal is a good method for the two of you. To make a decision like this, it’s helpful to have as much information as possible.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"http://www.vanguardngr.com/2015/05/she-doesnt-like-condoms/","2":"666","3":"Health","4":"2","5":"en","6":"0.9999923706"},{"0":"Sheik-up: Sir Alex Ferguson and a member of the Al Thani family during Man U’s visit to Qatar in January last year.\nZurich, Switzerland – FIFA on Monday raised objections to holding the 2022 Qatar World Cup in the summer despite calls by top European clubs and leagues.\nFIFA’s medical chief highlighted the health risk of holding matches between May and September, while the governing body’s secretary general Jerome Valke said there would be a clash with the Muslim fasting month.\nAfter a meeting of a task force to decide the dates of the Qatar tournament, FIFA said that a tournament in November-December or January-February was favoured.

But for us as a party we know that NYSC is a mandatory scheme. It is not something you may elect to do or abstain from doing and my understanding of the NYSC Act is that no employer of labour is permitted to employ anyone who graduated under 30 years and who did not obtain an exemption for reasons as provided for in the NYSC Act. So, for us, not participating in the NYSC raises very serious moral issue as well as legal issue. After interviewing him, we were convinced that….for our party, there are clear lessons we need to learn from our recent past when people…anyway, we were convinced that if he did not do NYSC, that for us, was enough to disqualify him and we had to find the courage to do so.\n“As for the Honourable Minister of Women Affairs, she has issues that have to do with party loyalty. Our constitution is clear and it dictates that to contest elections or even hold office in the APC, you must be loyal to the party in every material concern. From all she had said in the past and even her comments and general attitude during the screening, the NWC reviewed everything taken together and we arrived at the conclusion that she does not possess the level of loyalty that the APC requires for her to contest elections on our platform. We made it clear when the defections happened that APC may well benefit from these defections if it helps us to be more critical in terms of who we give platform to contest elections and that there are core values that binds the APC together and they are non-negotiable.\n“The Electoral Act and the APC Constitution forbids anyone from being a member of more than one political party at a time. You cannot be a member of APC and be a card-carrying member of another party but when you have a situation where it would appear, based on what you know and based on what I know that someone is probably APC in the daytime maybe for the purpose of retaining certain offices and they are PDP at heart or if they are not PDP at heart, they are actually and simply a follower of a one-man permanent presidential candidate…then we have the right to ask ourselves if these attitudes and qualities are characteristics of an ideal member of an APC. So, those are the reasons. We did not want to have a lengthy explanation to do but she knows why she was disqualified and we know why we denied her the use of our platform”, he said.\nHajia Alhassan had last year raises dusts when she declared her support for a PDP presidential aspirant and former vice president, Atiku Abubakar.\nOn the just concluded governorship elections in Osun state, Oshiomhole declared it “substantially” free and fair. He said he used the word ‘substantial” due to the incidences that forced the Independent National Electoral Commission INEC to cancel the first round of elections in seven polling units.\nHe said INEC declared the APC candidate winner based on their independent assessment of facts of the election, dismissing concerns that the electoral umpire might have come under undue influence from the APC led federal government.\nOshiomhole also added that the candidate of the Social Democratic Party SDP in the election, Sen. Iyiola Omisore was never bribed to get his support for the rerun.\nAccording to him, Omisore only extracted a firm commitment from the ruling party that it would implement some policy issues in the SDP manifesto.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"https://www.vanguardngr.com/2018/09/primaries-how-atiku-cost-mama-taraba-apc-ticket-oshiomhole/","2":"1040","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999961853"},{"0":"The Attorney General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami, kept mum on Monday when he was questioned by journalists on the legality of freezing bank accounts owned by #EndSARS protesters and promoters.\nAGF kept mum, smile, and walked away when he was accosted by journalists who asked about the legality of the action by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN).\nChannels Television has earlier reported that the CBN received an order granted by Justice Ahmed Mohammed to freeze the account of 20 individuals and an organisation linked to #EndSARS campaign.\nREAD ALSO: Clampdown On #EndSARS Promoters Is Unacceptable And Not Wise, Moghalu Tells FG\nSome of the affected individuals include Bolatito Racheal Oduala, Chima David Ibebunjoh, Mary Doose Kpengwa, Saadat Temitope Bibi, Bassey Victor Israel, Wisdom Busaosowo Obi, Nicholas Ikhalea Osazele, Ebere Idibie, Akintomide Lanre Yusuf, Uhuo Ezenwanyi Promise, and Mosopefoluwa Odeseye.\nOthers are: Adegoke Pamilerin Yusif.

All these governmentâ€™s efforts and contributions were not seen as interference by the NFA, but the advice from my office to the NFA leadership, to suspend all processes towards the elections and concentrate on the World Cup was blatantly ignored.\nRather, it chose to report to FIFA that the Federal Government was interfering in the running of football in Nigeria.

Buhari, on Sunday in his nationwide broadcast, imposed a total lockdown restricting movements in Lagos, Ogun and Abuja.\nAddressing Nigerians, the President said: “based on the advice of the Federal Ministry of Health and the NCDC, I am directing the cessation of all movements in Lagos and the FCT for an initial period of 14 days with effect from 11pm on Monday, 30th March 2020.\n“This restriction will also apply to Ogun State due to its close proximity to Lagos and the high traffic between the two States.”\nHe urged all citizens in these areas to stay in their homes, adding that travel to or from other states should be postponed.\nAll businesses and offices within these locations should also be fully closed during this period, President Buhari ordered.\nIn a jointly issued statement Monday by the Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning and CBN governor, entitled: ‘ Notice to affected stakeholders and general public regarding COVID-19 and restrictions in

expected from Germany, the Federal Government says it will take possession of other stolen antiquities from U.S. and Scotland in October.\nThe Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed disclosed this on Saturday in Lagos at a media briefing on the efforts by the federal government to repatriate looted smuggled artefacts from around the world.\n“In March 2021, the University of Aberdeen in Scotland agreed to return a Benin Bronze from its collections.\n“We shall take possession of this in October this year.\n“We have also secured a date in October 2021 for the repatriation of antiquities from the Metropolitan Museum in New York.\n“These antiquities consist of two important Benin Bronzes and an exquisite Ife Bronze head,’’ he said.\nThe minister said the development formed parts of the successes recorded by the campaign he launched in Nov. 2019 for the return and restitution of Nigeria’s looted/smuggled artefacts from around the world.\nMohammed recalled that in Oct. 2020, the Netherlands returned a highly-valued 600-year-old Ife Terracotta while Mexico returned a bronze piece in April 2021.\n“The University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom has also agreed to return a disputed Benin artefact.\n“We will soon commence the procedure for the repatriation of this highly-valued piece,’’ he said.\nMohammed said the country is currently before the Intergovernmental Committee for Promoting the Return of Cultural Property to it Countries of Origin or its Restitution in case of Illicit Appropriation (ICPRCP) in Paris.\nHe said a claim was instituted before the committee against a Belgian who wanted to auction an Ife Bronze head valued at 5 million Dollars.\nThe minister said that the Ife Bronze antiquity had been seized by the London Metropolitan Police, pending the decision on who the true owner was.\nAccording to the minister, the most remarkable progress in the quest to repatriate looted artefacts was recorded in Germany on the repatriation of 1,130 Benin Bronzes to the country.\n“As you are aware, I recently led a high-level Nigerian delegation to Berlin, Germany, to iron out the modalities for the repatriation.\n“The negotiations were tough but fruitful and have agreed that there is no going back on the issue of returning the Benin Bronzes,’’ he said.\nThe minister said the agreement for repatriation of the artefacts should be signed in December while the repatriation should be concluded by Aug. 2022.\nHe said it was also agreed that the release would neither be attached with any conditional nor be staggered.\nAccording to the minister, with less than two years after he launched the campaign the efforts at repatriating Nigeria’s looted artefacts were achieving positive results.\n“The work ahead remains tough and daunting, but we will not relent until we have repatriated all our stolen and smuggled antiquities.\n“These artefacts are so cherished all over the world.\n“We realise that if they are returned to Nigeria and properly exhibited within and outside the country under our control, they stand to increase the influx of tourists to our nation and earn us good money.\n“Of course, these timeless and priceless pieces of work are an important part of our past, our history, our heritage resource, and allowing them to sit in the museums of other nations robs us of our history.\nHe stressed that, though not everyone in possession of the artefacts was willing to return them, the government remained undeterred in repatriating them and would continue to deploy all legal and diplomatic means.

Let me make this clear, I think somebody just wanted to bump into the President because the President had discussed what he wants.

And that is it.\n“I am talking about the clerk, governor saraki, the key characters in all of these had sufficient information directly or indirectly coming to them that the President will be meeting the party members and the party chairman was present on the ground. Assumption would have been that every loyal and committed party member would have presented themselves to the party and to their President. That did not happen yesterday (Tuesday).\n“I mean the information had been made available to people who would have decide this process. A respect for the President even if and for him to have made this point, even the outcome would have been the same. They chose to be absent. They chose to respect their party and the President. 51 APC Senators decided to answer the call of the party and the President and were present to this meeting.

Such measure in our view will reduce currency counterfeiting and enhance the confidence of Nigerians in this medium of exchange.\n“There is nothing fundamentally wrong with the idea to introduce the N5,000 as there are some benefits to be derived. Beside having the potential to reduce royalty payments on existing security features as well as the cost of printing and maintenance of the currencies, the initiative will enhance the profitability of the CBN and its ability to generate funds for the government. It is common knowledge that the CBN orders, prints, mints, handles and sells currencies to money deposit banks with which they carry out their intermediation functions. The margin between cost of printing and selling of currencies is one of CBN’s sources of fund. Although the cost of printing each denomination is the same, higher denominations are sold to banks at a premium and therefore, earn more for the CBN. Section 5(3) of the CBN Act 2007 requires that at year end, 75% of its net surplus must be paid to the Federal Government. Here lies an incentive to earn more money. In addition to this, the cost of cash management by banks will further reduce with positive impact on wealth creation.\n“In spite of the above benefits, we are not persuaded that the N5,000 denomination should be introduced. At a time when the size of government deficit is about 2.8% of GDP (although within acceptable limit), the intention to spend N40 billion for this exercise appears to be both a waste of scarce public resource and misplacement of priority. Set against the benefits, the proposed expenditure of N40 billion will add little or no value to wealth creation. The subsisting budget deficit, financed largely with domestic borrowing at an unsustainable rate, and therefore crowding out available credits to the economy, can further be reduced by this huge expenditure of N40 billion, if redirected to the funding of infrastructural development.\n“In our view, the introduction of N5000 note will eventually alter the pricing structure of products in the market leading ultimately to the permanent disappearance of the 5, 10, 20 & 50 naira notes (and even the proposed new coins) from circulation. The extinction of these smaller denominations will negatively impact the buying capacity and habits of low-income earners and the poor as goods and services will be priced above their levels. Sustained increases in prices may the unintended consequence.\n“Also, we strongly advocate that the CBN should work towards strengthening the purchasing power of the naira through policy consistency. The steady slide in the value of the naira in relation to other currencies like the USA dollar, British pound sterling, etc, as an import-dependent country should be a major source for concern. As an import-dependent nation, when Nigeria converted to naira and kobo in 1973, the exchange rate was GBP£1=N2 and USA$0.30=N1. Today, the exchange rate is now GBP£1=N246.31, USA$1=N157.50. From the literature and empirical experience, devaluation benefits export-oriented economies. As a mono-product and import-dependent economy, we are most unlikely to benefit from the resultant devaluation that this initiative may unwittingly cause. Since the naira is not convertible, increasing the denomination will not check the perceived trend towards dollarisation.\n“The CBN’s repeated change in its monetary policy rate is an indication of severity of inflation which it has been targeting for some time. If unemployment was lower, it would not have been a cause for worry given the established inverse relation between unemployment and inflation. To print more currency as envisaged without earning foreign revenue to support its value will put more inflationary pressure on the naira and lead to a diminution in its value. Indeed, one of the indices of a growing inflation, from economic history, is the creation of higher denominations as exemplified by Argentina, Peru, Poland, Russia, Democratic Republic of Congo, Angola, Zimbabwe, etc.\n“The aforementioned press statement of the Governor did not indicate whether the introduction of the N5,000 notes will involve the printing of more currency notes to complement the existing quantity of money in circulation or it intends to substitute some smaller denominations with the proposed new note. It merely said that some currencies will be converted to coins. Whatever the intention, we shudder to think that the CBN plans to increase the quantity (volume) of money in circulation by introducing N5000 notes when the possible inflationary impact of this is common knowledge! Or does the CBN want to substitute higher denomination for smaller, more convenient, ones when Nigerians are yearning for enhanced value of the naira that will lead to the return of Kobo coins? Who is the beneficiary of a denomination that will stall transactions in rural Nigeria inhabited by 70% of the populace? Only the convenience of the elite and urban dweller will be assuaged. Following the CBN statistics that 90% of Nigerians’ cash transaction is less than N150,000, why substitute their preference for higher denomination? Is it not obvious that small transactions will be made more difficult if a proportion of each smaller denomination is eliminated?\n“We are persuaded that the initiative will impair the modest gains recorded with the Anti-Money Laundering Act and the pilot cashless policy in Lagos which the institute expects to spread to the entire country by first quarter of 2013. The convenience of carriage of N5,000 notes will indeed, be an incentive, not disincentive, to carry cash. Such an incentive will defeat the acclaimed drive towards a cashless economy. If the international community perceives that we are lax in anti-money laundering agenda which higher denomination and convenience of carriage connote, we stand the risk of being the target of FATF initiatives including blacklisting with its attendant problems for the attraction of Foreign Direct Investment. This is an untoward route that we have taken before. It should be avoided.\n“The heroines or amazons to be honoured- Mrs Funmilayo Ransome Kuti, Mrs Margaret Ekpo and Hajia Gambo Sawaba (of blessed memory) – deserve all the possible posthumous recognitions available because of the profound contributions and enduring legacy they made to humanity particularly, the less privileged. They represented the finest women of their era and even today, set against all best practice parameters, their achievements tower. Indeed, they were rich in ideas, principles and strong in character. As dogged fighters for the rights of the downtrodden, honouring them with the highest currency denomination belies their pro-proletariat stance. They never made any pretensions to pro-elitism and should not be painted in that light.\n“Finally, the national economy is confronted with a lot of challenges requiring ingenious strategies to overcome.

Failure to do this on the idealistic grounds that the quality of our public officials is more important than their ethnic and religious origin is bound to be problematic.\nNigerians are yet to believe, if we ever will, that the competence of a president is more important than his ethnicity. In any case, the background of a president is without prejudice to his ability. There is no ethnic group in Nigeria that does not have people who can be excellent presidents. However, if issues of federal character and ethnic-balancing are not addressed in Nigerian politics, even the best presidential materials will become ineffective.\nThe average Nigerian is not a sophisticated voter. Therefore, people like me will continue to analyse Nigerian politics from the perspective of the need for regional and ethnic-balancing.\nThe APC is seen as a vehicle for Northern domination of Nigerian politics and many people are implacably opposed to this. Although the APC claims not to subscribe to zoning, everyone knows its 2015 presidential candidate must come from the North, otherwise the centre will no longer hold. Certainly, all those insisting the North must regain power have flocked to the APC precisely because they see it as the vehicle for realizing their dreams.\nThere is also widespread perception that the APC is sympathetic to the Boko Haram. Fani-Kayode, a former APC member, complained that the APC is the political wing of the Boko Haram in the same way that Sinn Fein was the political wing of the Irish Republican Army in Britain. Indeed, for the longest time, some APC members were Boko Haram apologists. Murtala Nyako even claimed the Boko Haram was a Southern hoax. He called it a “phantom.” Muhammadu Buhari sought political amnesty for the Boko Haram; demanding the insurgents should be given the same golden handshakes as the militants of the Niger Delta.\nTherefore, it will not be easy getting non regionally-chauvinistic votes for a Northern APC presidential candidate in 2015. If that Northerner is a Muslim, it would be harder still. The Boko Haram insistence that Nigeria must become a Muslim Caliphate and the systematic bombing of churches and killing of Christians in the North ensures that religion will be a major factor in the coming election.\nWhile Muslims may have no qualms voting for a Christian president, Christians are likely to see the defeat of an incumbent Christian president by a Northern Muslim as succumbing to Boko Haram. That feeling is unlikely to be assuaged by a Southern Christian vice-president, in the same way that the demands of some Northerners for a Northern president have not been assuaged by the fact that the current vice-president is from the North.\nThe blunder of Atiku Abubakar in stating that the North will not be voting for President Jonathan in 2015 betrays the Northern bias of the APC. If the North will not be voting for a Southern candidate, why would the South vote for a Northern candidate?\nA Southern Christian presidential running-mate in 2011, in the person of Pastor Tunde Bakare, did not help Buhari, who remains a hard sell in the South. Buhari was only able to muster a measly 391,922 votes from the South, out of a total of over 38 million votes cast nationwide. That is conclusive proof that fielding Buhari yet again as the Northern presidential hopeful, on a fourth time lucky gambit, is bound to fail. Chances are Buhari would get even less votes this time out than he did in 2011.\nThe challenge for the APC is to get Southerners to vote for a Northern APC presidential candidate in 2015, in spite of the current regional and religious polarization of Nigerian politics.\nThe APC desperately needs a Southern politician to balance its Northern presidential ticket. However, such politician cannot come from the South-East or the South-South.\nIn spite of the presence of men like Rochas Okorocha of the South-East, and Rotimi Amaechi of the South-South, the APC has little chance of getting significant South-East and South-South votes. These geopolitical zones remain Jonathan strongholds. Their voters are not likely to agree to truncate Jonathan’s South-South presidency in exchange for a Northern president and a South-South or South-East vice-presidency. If APC is to get vital Southern votes in 2015, the answer lies in the South-West; a region of residual APC/ACN political strength.\nThe APC needs a vice-presidential candidate with sufficient political clout to galvanise South-West votes. There is only one man in South-West politics today that can conceivably marshal bloc South-West votes for the APC in 2015. That man is none other than Babatunde Fashola! As far as the APC is concerned, Fashola is the game-changer!\nThis truth will be very bitter for die-hard Tinubu supporters. But the fact is that Fashola, and not Tinubu, is now the poster-boy for the APC in the South-West. In spite of having the second-largest bloc of voters among the six regions in the country, the South-West had the least number of voters in 2011. Only 34% of the South-West’s 14 million voters bothered to vote. Fashola could conceivably invigorate South-West voters in a way no other politician currently on the horizon can.\nFashola as APC vice-presidential candidate will do for a Northern candidate what Bakare could not do for Buhari in 2011; he will clean up South-West votes. If nothing else, Fashola has a legacy of eight years of tarring roads, building bridges and planting grass and flowers in Lagos. Moreover, he does not come with the political baggage of Bola Tinubu, who has become a political liability, even in the South-West.\nUnlike Tinubu, Fashola has not antagonized the Afenifere and the Yoruba Obas. Indeed, the coming regional elections in the South-West are shaping out to be as much about the need to bring an end to the domineering politics of Tinubu as anything else. With Tinubu on the ticket, allegations of certificate forgeries, inordinate land-grabs, nepotism, alpha beta scams, toll-gate deals and anti-democratic manipulations will come to the fore. Therefore, in contrast to Tinubu, Fashola is a breath of fresh air.\nNeutralisation of Tinubu\nA Fashola vice-presidency would have the added political bonus of spelling the end of the political pretensions of Bola Tinubu in the South-West. Vice-president Fashola will quickly upstage “party leader” Tinubu. A Fashola vice-presidency would mean, to all intents and purposes, the passing of the baton from Tinubu to Fashola. It would spell the end of the self-appointed “godfather” of South-West politics. Therefore, Tinubu can be expected to say to a Fashola vice-presidency: “over my dead body!”\nBut the fact of the matter is that the APC only has a chance in the coming presidential election “over the dead body” of Tinubu. Tinubu must be marginalized in any marketable APC equation. Any attempt to accommodate him inordinately, as happened in the rigging of Oyegun as party chairman with the collusion of APC governors, will turn far more ugly and disastrous for the party than it was the last time. To have any reasonable chance of success nationally, APC must have a viable South-West policy. That means its presidential ticket must be built around one man: Babatunde Fashola.\nFashola as APC vice-presidential candidate would be a stroke of genius for the APC in addressing yet another liability of the party: its widespread perception as a Muslim party. This perception has come about because Bola Tinubu’s ACN never ever fielded a non-Muslim candidate as the governor of any South-Western state. When the APC registered as a political party with INEC, 17 of its 18 board-members were Muslims. For months until recently, all members of the APC national executive were Muslims. Foolishly, the APC even rationalized its earlier plans for a Muslim/Muslim presidential ticket on the pages of the newspapers.\nHowever, the vice-presidential candidacy of Babatunde Fashola would prescribe a Northern Christian as APC presidential candidate, for the simple reason that Fashola is a Muslim. The emergence of a Northern Christian as APC presidential candidate would open many doors closed to the APC politically. In one fell swoop, it would dispel all notions that the APC is the political arm of the Boko Haram because the last thing the Boko Haram want is a Christian president.\nChanging of the guard\nAPC fools no one by talking power shift and then touting people like Buhari and Kwankwaso as its presidential hopefuls. How does another Hausa-Fulani president of Nigeria speak power-shift? This is Atiku’s bargaining-chip; that power needs to shift from the North-West and the North-Central to the North-East. Unfortunately, apart from supposedly having a fat war-chest, Atiku is not sell-able as president of Nigeria. He has tried before and failed woefully. In any case, Atiku is a Muslim. There is need for power shift in the North from Moslems to Christians in defiance of Boko Haram threats.\nA Northern Christian as APC presidential candidate will achieve this. It will make the party more attractive in the predominantly Christian South, where voters may be dissuaded from voting for a Northern Muslim president in this era of Boko Haram insurgency. It will also open the APC to Northern Christian votes which might not be forthcoming otherwise. It must be pointed out that there are far more Christians in the North than many realise. Adamawa, Benue, Nassarawa, Plateau and Taraba all have majority Christian populations; while Bauchi, Borno, Gombe, Kaduna, Kogi, Kwara and Niger have significant Christian populations.\nFor the APC to have even a look-in in the coming presidential elections against an entrenched PDP, it needs a fresh slate from the political has-beens of Atiku, Buhari and Kwankwaso that it is still currently touting as its presidential hopefuls today. To be truly progressive, the APC must not just talk progressivism, it must walk progressivism. A Northern Christian presidential candidate will definitely give political backbone to APC’s progressive pretensions; neutralising the damage done by its earlier suicidal plans for a Muslim/Muslim presidential ticket.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"http://www.vanguardngr.com/2014/09/northern-christian-presidential-candidate-apc/#sthash.7Eul31mK.dpuf","2":"2359","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999446869"},{"0":"It has been a controversial impeachment of the Speaker of the Kogi State House of Assembly, as five lawmakers in a 20-member house sat on Tuesday and purportedly removed the Speaker, Honourable Momoh Jimoh.\nThe lawmakers also chose Umar Imam as the new Speaker of the House.\nFriday Sanni, who briefed journalists about the impeachment, said the Speaker was impeached for not carrying other members of the House along in the affairs of the House.\nHe also claimed that since the new Governor, Yahaya Bello and the Speaker are both from the same senatorial district, the Speaker should vacate the seat.\nMeanwhile, 15 members of the House who were seen at Hon.

Besides the festivities, the three-month roller-coaster event designed to celebrate the teaching hospital’s birthday also provides an opportunity for stocktaking and recalibration for the future, reports Associate Editor ADEKUNLE YUSUF\nMany Nigerians, old and young, appear to be losing hope in their country, but not 88-year old John Olaoye Abioye, an academic retiree. Recently, the retired professor had another reason to rekindle his hope in Nigeria, believing once again that the country can actually work and reclaim its lost glory in spite of multi-faceted challenges currently inhibiting its destined march to greatness.\nThis was in June this year when Abioye, who retired from the services of the University of Lagos (UNILAG) in 1999, woke up with a severe toothache, which landed him in the Lagos University Teaching Hospital (LUTH). As the retiree, who joined the services of UNILAG in 1969, was led to the Dental Care Clinic gate at LUTH for the much-needed treatment on June 29 this year, he was both “shocked and happy seeing a beautifully-mounted signboard that reads: Faculty of Dental Services.”\nExpressing his joy in seeing the departmental upgrade, Prof Abioye added that he was also tremendously satisfied with the state of infrastructure renewal taking place in the teaching hospital as well as the quality of medical service he received. While commending the management of LUTH, the retired professor described the LUTH medical team as “diligent, cheerful, respectful and professional.” He made bared his mind on infrastructural renaissance taking place in LUTH in a commendation letter, dated July 25, 2022, which he addressed to Prof Oluwatoyin Ogundipe, Vice Chancellor, UNILAG. The retired professor is one of many stakeholders who are happy seeing what is taking place in LUTH.\n“In spite of my tooth ache, I stopped, gazed and gazed, looking as if I was visiting the LUTH for the first time. I feel very excited in the wake of seeing, for the first time, on Wednesday June 29, 2022, that part of our famous College of Medicine (which used to exist, until I retired in 1999, as either a Department or School) has been upgraded into a full-fledged Faculty (of Dental Sciences). I hereby congratulate the authorities of UNILAG (past and present) for this praise-worthy elevation.”\nWeeks after the commendation letter, the management and staff of LUTH have been locked in a revelry mode celebrating the sixtieth anniversary of its birth. The teaching hospital was enacted into existence by a cabinet decision made in April of 1961, following recommendations made by the Sir Eric Ashby’s Commission on Post-Secondary Education in Nigeria.\nAt a press conference to flag off its 60th anniversary celebrations, LUTH) unfolded plans to perform its first bone marrow transplant for cure of sickle cell anaemia. The Chief Medical Director (CMD), LUTH, Prof Chris Bode, made this known during the opening ceremony and unveiling of anniversary logo to herald the diamond jubilee. According to him, the three-month celebration would feature an art exhibition, sports, seminars, health walk, gala night, student funfair, visit to Oba of Lagos, presentation of awards, among others. Also, many landmark projects would be inaugurated.\n“We shall be performing our first bone marrow transplant for cure of sickle cell anaemia. A new 30-bedded Intensive Care Unit (ICU) is about to be completed and put to use. A new outpatient complex is under construction. This complex comprises five buildings, each comprising four floors to house 256 consultation rooms, 16 waiting areas, 16 nursing stations, eight meeting rooms, eight patients’ lifts and many other facilities, including a car park, cafeterias, shops, amongst others,” he said.\nBode said since LUTH admitted its first patient on August 9, 1962, the teaching hospital has gone on to continue its commitment to improve public health through innovative solutions as well as contributed in the training of medical and paramedical personnel both within and outside the shores of Nigeria. “Over the years, LUTH has remained one of the best teaching/specialist hospitals in the country. The hospital is designated a centre of excellence in dentistry. A major breakthrough of the successful conception and delivery of the first authentic test tube (In-Vitro-Fertilisation) baby was performed by the duo of Prof Osato Frank Giwa-Osagie and Prof Oladapo Ashiru at LUTH.\n“The hospital also renders services in specialised areas of medicine like neuro-surgery, haemo-dialysis, radiation, oncology, ophthalmology, obstetrics and gynaecology, cardiothoracic surgery, urology, paediatric surgery, maxillofacial surgery, ear nose and throat surgery, haematology, medical microbiology, community health, child dental health, restorative dentistry, maternal health, psychiatry, orthopaedic surgery, etc.\n“LUTH has the highest concentration of skilled medical and paramedical staff in different areas of medicine. This explains the reason the hospital is always the focus when foreign countries, oil companies and even highbrow private hospitals in Nigeria are on recruitment drive for manpower. It has pioneered small incision cataract excision surgery in Nigeria and trained over 40 doctors from all over the country in the procedure in the past years. The hospital has also commenced laparoscopic general and gynaecologic surgery, which has dramatically reduced the duration of hospitalisation after surgery.\n“LUTH boasts a comprehensive diagnostic centre and VIP clinic, state-of-the-art laboratories, radio-diagnosis, radiotherapy and renal dialysis facilities. From a humble beginning of 330 beds, LUTH is the largest teaching hospital in Nigeria with over 1,000 beds and with the College of Medicine of the University of Lagos, LUTH is involved in the training of hundreds of medical, dental, pharmacy and other allied health science students.\n“The hospital has produced thousands of nurses, laboratory scientists, health records officers, biomedical engineers and other para-medical cadres. Various members of the consultant staff have made significant contributions to the advancement of knowledge in major areas of medical science, notably in the separation of conjoined twins and In-Vitro-Fertilisation. LUTH is a unique institution in not only having such a large catchment population, but also having a large concentration of highly specialised manpower that enables it to respond to a variety of health conditions and trainings.\n“It has also taken advantage of the FGN Public Private Partnership Initiatives, and partners private organisations in providing state-of-the-art facilities. The flagship of such partnership is the multi-million dollars NSIA-LUTH Cancer Centre (NLCC), the first of its kind in West Africa. Others are LUTH Blood Banking System, Radiodiagnosis Centre, Independent Power Project, Sickle Cell Centre/LUTH Bone Marrow Transplant Centre, and Olusola Dada Dialysis Centre and Renal Institute. LUTH is the only Federal Teaching Hospital with independent power project that generates its electricity, and, therefore, has been enjoying uninterrupted power supply since December 2017.\n“The biggest renal institute in Nigeria, Isaac Olusola Dada Dialysis Centre and Renal Institute, is already inaugurated and functional. Alima Atta Oncology Wards (60-bed wards) is near completion. LUTH has also partnered Smile Train since 2007. With this, Smile Train has supported free surgical treatment of patients with orofacial clefts, with over 800 surgical repairs of cleft lip and/palate done in LUTH so far.\n“Other areas of care being supported by Smile Train include orthodontics care, speech therapy and nutrition for patients with orofacial clefts. Kids Operating room [KidsOR), a global health charity focused on brining equitable access to safe surgery for children, and Smile Train supported LUTH with a grant of over $500,000 for the renovation, furnishing and equip two state-of-the-art (paediatric) theatres, dedicated only for children surgical procedures.”\nWhile appreciating the Federal Government as well as the management and staff of LUTH, he enjoined stakeholders to work towards the betterment of the institution. “As we look to the future, we must reflect on the past 60 years and imagine what LUTH shall be at its centennial in another 40 years. Let us dream dreams and come up with lofty goals which shall be our own legacies to be celebrated by posterity. As we celebrate, we are also engaging stakeholders to define the new goals and projects for the future of our institution,” Bode added.\nRegarded as one of the foremost teaching hospitals in the country, LUTH, many stakeholders in the healthcare delivery believe, has lived up to its billing, gradually facilitating into a highly functional, professional, patient-focused, and results-oriented health institution. Prof Bode, who became the CMD in March 2015, shortly after he was drafted to be the Chairman of the Medical Advisory Committee (CMAC) of the hospital, is popularly applauded for the whirlwind of reforms and positive changes his tenure has brought to LUTH.\nHe confronted and strategically tackled immediate problems of the tertiary hospital: poor staff morale, incessant strike actions, and dilapidated infrastructure. The institution, which almost lost its accreditation in surgery year back, has since found its way for ensuring service delivery through collaboration, culminating in landing several world-class facilities through Private-Public Partnership (PPP), thus boosting the nation’s healthcare as well as research and training in line with global acceptable best practices.\n“Efforts in the past 7 years led to several modest contributions to elevate the LUTH brand, thereby improving both human and infrastructural capacities hospital-wide. Immediately after reaching out to a couple of low-hanging fruits; on-going projects were strategised and completed on both medium and long-term spans.”","1":"https://thenationonlineng.net/celebrating-sixty-years-of-medical-excellence/?utm_term=Autofeed&utm_medium=Social&utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1663909816","2":"2206","3":"Health","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999828339"},{"0":"Wholesale By Popularity\nWholesale By Fashion\nTOP REASONS TO BUY WHOLESALE JEWELRY FROM JEWELRYBUND.COM\n- Wholesale Jewelry 100000+ Selections\n- As a prestigious wholesale jewelry supplier, we offer thousands of wholesale jewelry online at affordable price.

Photo by Gbemiga Olamikan.\nBy Tonnie Iredia\nThe Special Mini Convention of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to fill some positions in the party’s National Executive has come and gone. Whether or not the party deserves commendation can be viewed from two standpoints. The first and perhaps the more obvious is that which believes that to congratulate the party on the event does not in essence arise. This is because there was nothing special about the convention as its title tended to impute. The correct title should have been “PDP Repeat Convention”.\nIn March 2012, the PDP held a national convention to elect its national officers. The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) which is statutorily mandated to supervise the event ruled that it was defective thereby necessitating a repeat.\nAccordingly, the party organized another convention on Saturday August 31, 2013.On the occasion, the party, with all glamour and pageantry rolled out the drums and with newly designed decorative uniforms sat again for an examination on aspects of the famous internal democracy course which it earlier failed. Why congratulate a party that was in the same position as a student who was merely re-writing his “carry-over” course in an examination?\nWhy congratulate the party when it did not take more than one day for the world to learn that the event ended poorly? Oh yes, the glamour of the PDP convention was cut short as some of its key members walked-out on the party before the event ended? That was not all; they formally formed a faction which has to a large extent destabilized the party. So why would anyone praise the PDP over what has turned out to be an ill-fated convention?\nThe type of message of congratulations which I sent to a friend who lost his father last week seems to me as good for the PDP at this point. So, just as I sent a good will message to my friend for surviving his father, I heartily congratulate the PDP for surviving its own intrigues and pervasive impunity. In earnest, the party has become obese and unwieldy with many inexplicable issues.\nFor example, whereas posterity would easily understand that in 2013, the PDP Governors Forum, being a PDP affair, was naturally led by the PDP Governor of Akwa Ibom State, it would be difficult to comprehend why the Nigerian Governors Forum of 19 was led by the PDP Governor of Rivers State while the “bigger” Nigerian Governors Forum of 16 was led also by the PDP Governor of Plateau State. This picture of one political party overseeing 3 secretariats on one subject vividly reflects the dilemma of the largest political party in Africa.\nWho could have caused this dilemma? Put differently, who are the real enemies of President Jonathan who are about to destroy the party during his tenure? Could it be the break- away Governors? To put so much blame that way appears simplistic because everyone saw it coming. The now captioned break-away Governors gave more than ample notice as their complaints were not secret-they openly articulated them and consulted widely.\nThey visited some elders including formers heads of government and at no location did any of their hosts condemn either the content or posture of their visit. Neither their plan to hold a factional convention on the same day nor the venue of their convention can be described as spontaneous. The same is true of the list of members of their interim national executive. All these issues appear predetermined in what can be called ‘Plan B’.\nThe situation could have been prevented if the coordinating engine of the “loyalists” around the President had sought to dialogue rather than overwhelm. It would really have been a different ball game if those grievances which the chairman of the parent board of trustees thought could be genuine were isolated and a few concessions made here and there. Many of the so-called contentious issues could have been put on the family table where some members could have been persuaded to see reason.\nIf Governor Amaechi is ambitious as alleged, elders of the South-South family should have used every avenue to draw his attention severally to the common good of a united zone. Instead, everyone behaved as if the man was not entitled to his own ambition. At the same time, the anti-Jonathan groups should have been constantly reminded that not being unconstitutional for the President to contest the 2015 elections, it is only fair to allow him enjoy an advantage as they, the opponents would have done if they were in his shoes.\nIt is unfortunate that those in the corridors of power did not see this apparent superiority of give and take approach as well as dialogue to the use of force. Instead, they sought to overwhelm dissension. Even critics were not spared. El Rufai, Oby Ezekwesili, Ben Nwabueze etc were abused without providing concrete evidence to remove from the public domain some solid criticisms they raised.\nThe Ezekwesili case was the worst poorly handled as government officials merely indicated that she too was not clean while in government. Does it mean that her ‘wrongs’ would have been overlooked if she said nothing? It is thus not uncharitable to suggest that the friends of government have been more of a problem than the opposition. For instance, although the President has pleaded many times not to be distracted from governance emphasizing that he would not speak on his next political option until 2014, it is those closest to power that are holding rallies for 2015 in breach of the electoral law.\nI therefore heartily congratulate President Jonathan on the opportunity which the current PDP uprising offers him to outlaw every youthful exuberance, adult rascality and proactive senility from his supposed admirers because such unwholesome behaviour derogates from his popularity daily. It is also a good time for him to lead his own cause notwithstanding the setting up of ‘elders group’ to resolve the crisis. This is because, in these times, trust is dicey. As our people say, if one thief is among a group that is helping a man find his lost item, it is probably lost forever.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"http://www.vanguardngr.com/2013/09/hearty-congratulations-to-pdp/","2":"1297","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999980927"},{"0":"BODO, Nigeria Big oil spills are no longer news in this vast, tropical land. The Niger Delta, where the wealth underground is out of all proportion with the poverty on the surface, has endured the equivalent of the Exxon Valdez spill every year for 50 years by some estimates. The oil pours out nearly every week, and some swamps are long since lifeless.\nPerhaps no place on earth has been as battered by oil, experts say, leaving residents here astonished at the nonstop attention paid to the gusher half a world away in the Gulf of Mexico. It was only a few weeks ago, they say, that a burst pipe belonging to Royal Dutch Shell in the mangroves was finally shut after flowing for two months: now nothing living moves in a black-and-brown world once teeming with shrimp and crab.\nNot far away, there is still black crude on Gio Creek from an April spill, and just across the state line in Akwa Ibom the fishermen curse their oil-blackened nets, doubly useless in a barren sea buffeted by a spill from an offshore Exxon Mobil pipe in May that lasted for weeks.\nThe oil spews from rusted and aging pipes, unchecked by what analysts say is ineffectual or collusive regulation, and abetted by deficient maintenance and sabotage. In the face of this black tide is an infrequent protest soldiers guarding an Exxon Mobil site beat women who were demonstrating last month, according to witnesses but mostly resentful resignation.\nSmall children swim in the polluted estuary here, fishermen take their skiffs out ever farther “There’s nothing we can catch here,” said Pius Doron, perched anxiously over his boat and market women trudge through oily streams. “There is Shell oil on my body,” said Hannah Baage, emerging from Gio Creek with a machete to cut the cassava stalks balanced on her head.","1":"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/17/world/africa/17nigeria.html?hp","2":"399","3":"Politics","4":"2","5":"en","6":"0.9999847412"},{"0":"•Say enough is enough\n•Attack on any Igbo soil is an attack on Nigeria—Iwuanyanwu\n•Displaced residents narrate ordeals\n•Nursing mothers, widows, bedridden patients now in exile—Rep\nBy Anayo Okoli, Emman Ovuakporie, Vincent Ujumadu, Johnbosco Agbakwuru, Chinenyeh Ozor\nUMUAHIA—As condemnations continue to trail the massacre of no fewer than 40 people of Nimbo community in Uzo-Uwani Local Government Area of Enugu by Fulani herdsmen last Monday, Igbo youths under the aegis of Ohaneze Youth Council (OYC) have given the herdsmen three days to leave Igbo land or they will be forced out.\nThe Igbo youths gave the herdsmen till Monday to vacate all Igboland saying enough is enough even as it was gathered that the attack by the herdsmen has forced nursing mothers, widows, children and bedridden patients from the affected communities into exile.\nAn Igbo traditional ruler, Igwe Rowland Odegbo and Champion newspaper publisher, Chief Emmanuel Iwuanyanwu also condemned the massacre and tasked President Muhammadu Buhari to bring the perpetrators to justice.\nRising from an emergency meeting held in Enugu on Thursday, the Igbo youths in their communique noted that the herdsmen “are off-shoots of Boko Haram and must not be allowed any breeding ground in Igbo land. Any herdsman who fails to quit South East by Monday will have himself to blame”.\nThe communique was signed by the National Vice President of the group, Mazi Obinna Achuonye and the Chairmen of OYC in seven Igbo- speaking states of Abia, Anambra, Ebonyi, Enugu, Delta, Imo and Rivers.\nAccording to the communique, “never again will Igbo youths fold their arms and watch our people being massacred by blood-sucking terrorists under the guise of herdsmen. Urgent times need drastic measure. We warn all violent Fulani herdsmen to vacate our farmland, our backyards, our territories and boundaries on or before Monday next week.\n“Even though Ohanaeze Ndigbo will meet over the weekend to discuss this menace, Igbo youths will not wait until our people are massacred again before we take action.\n“If after Monday and the herdsmen are still around, we will direct Igbo vigilante groups set up by OYC in all the 95 Local Government Areas in South East to force them out”.\nContinuing OYC said it had also uncovered plots through its intelligence unit that Ebonyi State has been marked as the next target of the rampaging herdsmen.\n“We have uncovered plots that their next target is Ebonyi State. They are coming from Taraba State to attack Ebonyi. We want the Governor of Ebonyi State and all the security agents in the state to be at alert”, OYC alerted. OYC claimed that Igbo youths were already collaborating with Ijaw youths and Middle Belt youths on how to defend their people as the Federal Government under Buhari has failed to protect them.\n“Ijaw youths, and Middle Belt progressives are already waiting for the expiration of the deadline on Monday. Fulani herdsmen have pushed us to the wall, time to take action is now or never”, it warned.\nNursing mothers, widows, bedridden patients now in exile—Rep\nMeanwhile, the barbaric murder of over 40 persons in Igboland by Fulani Herdsmen has forced nursing mothers, widows, children and bedridden patients in the area into exile, a member of the House of Representatives Chime Oji has said.\nSpeaking in an interview with Saturday Vanguard in Abuja, Oji who represents Enugu North/South Federal Constituency of Enugu State said that since the gruesome murder of innocent citizens by the herdsmen, the mood in the area had been that of total frustration, despair and anguish.\nAccording to him, “To the best of my knowledge, the killing was not an offhand attack. It was too coordinated to be an impromptu or perfunctory misunderstanding. The damage is colossal to be dismissive by any right thinking and patriotic Nigerian.”\nDescribing the mood in the area as that of anguish, he said, “it is total frustration, creating fear, despair, anguish and forced exile on the people, most of whom are infirm children, very old and pregnant women, nursing mothers and widows, including bedridden patients who were all compelled to leave their homes for exile.”\nDisplaced residents narrate ordeals\nResidents of the community who fled their homes as a result of the attack and now taking refuge at petrol stations, churches, motor parks, hospitals, army barracks and uncompleted buildings have also recounted their ordeals. One of the displaced persons, John Ayogu of Nimbo community told Vanguard that his family survives at the mercy of good Samaritans who donate food, water and fairly used clothes.\n“We sleep at any available space at night and roam the town in the day time for food to eat, mostly for the teenagers who were forced out of school by the barbaric attack and killings in our community. People have been helpful to the residents of Nimbo, some people took some of us to their residential homes to take refuge, and many others buy food items and water for us. We fled our community without food and cloth. The number of death was too much for one community to bear. Our children were forced out of school for a good number of days now; we don’t know when it will be safe for us to go back to ours farms. We are predominantly farmers but the herdsmen could not allow us settle in our farms as they rape women and young girls. We no longer allow our younger girls to go to the farms for fear of being defiled by Fulani herdsmen”\nUtazi Chikodili of Nimbo in tears at Royal Cross hospital said, ‘’Fulani herdsmen have finished our people, turned indigenes of Nimbo to beggers. We wander about everyday looking for food and water to stay alive with the little ones who could do nothing but to cry when they are hungry. We sleep at this hospital every day and night, people do come here to give us food and water, and we take our bath at midnight because of space.\nAjougwu Chisom (15) an SS 2 student at Community Secondary School, Nimbo and Ugwoke Regina (10) in primary six, said, ‘’we went to buy food items with the little money people gave to us. We are staying with our sister and our parents but we want to go back to school”\nAttack on any Igbo soil is an attack on Nigeria—Iwuanyanwu\nChief Iwuanyanwu, in his reaction said “once again, innocent Igbo blood have been shed in Igboland by Fulani herdsmen. The activities of these herdsmen in the past 12 months have been of great concern to all men and women, who are committed to the unity, peace and economic development of Nigeria. These group of people have waged serious war against many Nigerian communities.\n“Wherever they attacked, they were reported to have used sophisticated weapons and other weapons of modern warfare. They have slaughtered people in a most brutal and uncivilized manner. They have raped women, including young girls, married women and the aged women. This matter has become a matter of grave concern to everybody.\nThe recent attack in Ukpabi Nimbo in Enugu State, is very painful to Nigerians and Igbos in particular. By Igbo culture and tradition, the greatest injury one can inflict on an Igboman, is to attack him and kill him in his home. It is even worse when his property is destroyed, some lives are lost, their women brazenly violated. Attack on any Igbo soil is an attack on Nigeria and an impunity on the peace loving Igbo people.\n“This matter should not be treated with levity but regarded as a matter that can seriously affect peace, unity and economic progress of this country, which all of us are trying to achieve.\nToday, most farmers in these areas are afraid to go to their farms for fear that they may be killed, kidnapped or raped by this group, resulting in poor agricultural production in Igbo land and other parts of Nigeria, where they are invading. The truth is that this matter has assumed a dangerous dimension.\nThe Nigerian Police is over stretched. It is impossible for Nigeria to get enough policemen to police Igbo farmland and other parts of the country, where the so called herdsmen are rampaging. Rather the following questions needs to be addressed and answered:\n*By the laws of Nigeria, individuals are not allowed to carry automatic weapons. Who allowed the herdsmen to carry automatic weapons?\n*Since this invasion, kidnapping and raping by the Fulani herdsmen commenced some years ago, no arrests or prosecution or conviction has been made against any of them.\nSet up panel of inquiry, Monarch tells Buhari\nSimilarly, the traditional ruler of Nteje in Oyi local government area of Anambra State, Igwe Rowland Odegbo has called on President Muhammadu Buhari to set up a panel of inquiry to look into the remote and immediate causes of the activities of Fulani herdsmen who have been killing people in various parts of the country in recent times.\nSpeaking in an interview, Igwe Odegbo, who is a prominent member of Anambra State Council of Traditional Rulers, said the panel of inquiry should consist of security operatives, leaders of thought and traditional rulers.\nHe described as unfortunate a situation whereby herdsmen swoop on communities and slaughter people and wondered “why people should be killed because of cows”\nHe said: “President Buhari is a Fulani man and his silence on this matter is not sending any good signal. He was elected to protect the lives of all Nigerians irrespective of their tribe and he should not encourage a section of the country to threaten the lives of other Nigerians.\n“Grazing areas should only be established in the North for the people who do the business of rearing cows. They should not come down to the south to avoid conflict with communities who are mainly farmers.”\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"http://www.vanguardngr.com/2016/04/enugu-massacre-leave-land-now-igbo-youths-tell-fulani-herdsmen/","2":"2214","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999313354"},{"0":"File: Weapons seized from bandits.\nBy Henry Umoru—ABUJA\nThe Senate Leader, Senator Yahaya Abdullahi(APC-Kebbi North), has said 350 million (or 70%) of the 500 million illegal arms in West Africa were in Nigeria.\nSenator Abdullahi said this while recalling the report of the National Consultation on Physical Security and Stockpile Management (PSSM) organised in 2019 in Abuja by the United Nations Regional Centre for Peace and Disarmament in Africa (UNREC) and the Presidential Committee on Small Arms and Light Weapons (PRESCOM).\nThis is just as the Senate blamed the high level of violence, insecurity with consistent cases of armed banditry and kidnapping across the country, on the proliferation of weapons.\nAccording to the Senate, small arms and light weapons are readily available and quite easy to use, just as it said that against this backdrop they had become the primary or sole tool of violence in almost all conflicts in every part of our society.\nThe Senate said that these weapons were in the hands of irregular troops operating with lack of respect for international and humanitarian law, and they have taken a heavy toll on human lives, with women and children accounting for nearly 80 percent of the casualties.\nConsequently, the Upper Chamber has considered a critical bill seeking to tackle the illicit importation and trade of small arms and light weapons in Nigeria, even as the Nigerian National Commission Against the Proliferation of Small Arms and Light Weapons bill, on Wednesday, scaled second reading in the Senate.\nThe bill was sponsored by the Senate Leader, Senator Yahaya Abdullahi(APC-Kebbi North).\nThe bill, after consideration, was referred by the Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, to the Senate Committee on Defence for further legislative work.\nIn his lead debate, the Senate leader said that the piece of legislation, among other things, seeks to: identify sources and main routes of small arms, ammunition and light weapons; establish links of liaising with relevant authorities, agencies and organisations with the aim of tackling the menace; and train and build the capacity of the corps towards and enforcement of this mandate.\nAccording to him, when passed into law, the bill would put in place machineries such as the Nigerian National Commission Against the Proliferation of Small Arms and Light Weapons to combat illegal importation of arms; and enhance harmonisation of intelligence and information collection, analysis and dissemination among the Intelligence organs and law enforcement agencies.\nSenator Abdullahi said: “Small Arms and Light Weapons are readily available, easy to use and have been the primary or sole tool of violence in almost all conflicts in every part of our society.\n“These weapons of terror are in the hands of irregular troops operating with scant respect for international and humanitarian law.

There were also reports of low and high turnout of voters.\nIn Abuja, there was massive turn out of voters just as civil society organizations (CSOs) under the aegis of Situation Room raised the alarm over the alleged arrest and intimidation of its observers.\nIn a report made available to newsmen, yesterday, in Abuja and signed by Clement Nwankwo and Jibril Ibrahim, the groups said: “We note with dismay the seemingly systematic and coordinated intimidation and arrest of our observers deployed to observe the presidential election.\n“We are particularly disturbed by reports of these attacks in Jos, Plateau State. Although we understand that some of the observers were subsequently released, we have received reports of several other similar cases.\nIn Warri North in Delta State, three observers were detained. Two were later released; one is still being held. Tellingly, this was the same ward where observers were detained for seven hours during the voters’ registration.\n“Another area of serious concern is that of massive thumb-printing which was observed in Soku, Akuku Toro LGA in Rivers State. In Benue State, the chairperson of a publishing outfit was caught in a vehicle with previously thumb-printed ballot papers.\nA related issue is that of ballot box snatching. Again in Benue State, six ballot boxes were snatched at Achia Ikyurav-Ya in Kwande LGA, and an undisclosed number were snatched from Pus in Shough council ward, Gweru East LG by Hon. Christine Alaago”.\nThe group also noted that “the problem of underage voting was widely observed in many polling units in Bauchi, Gombe, Kaduna, Kano, Plateau, Nasarawa and Taraba states. In Gombe State in particular, it was reported that irate youths attempted to lynch the Resident Electoral Commissioner and some journalists present who tried to intervene”.\nLagos: 30 thugs, six aliens arrested\nIn Lagos State, immigration officers arrested six aliens and one under-aged girl, who tried to vote during the election at Amuwo-Odofin.\nThe exercise was generally peaceful and hitch-free and voters’ turnout was impressive. Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) officials and security agents arrived at the polling booths on time and accreditation started timely. In many polling centres, a windy queue of people stretching up to 200 metres was seen.\nAt Kuje-Amuwo, six foreigners, who were trying to vote at some of the polling units within the vicinity were apprehended by immigration officials.\nConfirming the incident, Inspector E.O Oduh, said the Immigration officials intercepted the foreigners – three Ghanaians and three Nigeriens – as well as an under-aged, who tried to vote.\nNo fever than 3 suspected thugs were arrested by policemen and army officers during the elections at Mushin after an attack on a polling centre. The thugs, numbering over 50, reportedly invaded a polling centre at Mosalasi with guns and other dangerous weapons as they created panic with heavy gun firing, leaving prospective voters running helter skelter.\nThe arrested persons were taken to Area D Command headquarters on along Isolo Road for investigations.\nAt a briefing, the state police commissioner, Suleiman Abba, described the election as ‘relatively peaceful’, and that he had not been briefed of the arrest of the hoodlums.\nNasarawa: Polling officers flee to palace to escape thugs\nPolling officers at Yelwa community in Agwada Development Area of Kokona Local Government Area of Nasarawa State, yesterday, fled to the palace of Sarkin Yelwa (traditional ruler), Alhaji Maiwada Dauda, after thugs, allegedly working for the one of the political parties, snatched the ballot box there and attempted to abduct them.\nThe presiding officer of Yelwa thugs stormed the polling unit and attempted to snatch ballot materials from the electoral personnel; at 1p.m. after voting commenced at the station.\nHe said policeman and some Civil Defence personnel attached to the polling station did not act.\nThe Divisional Police Officer in the area, Mr. Patrick Onah Agbo, confirmed the incident when contacted on phone, saying, “I sent the D.O. (Divisional Officer) in Agwada to go there. The Civil Defence man called him and said that the matter has been resolved there. That they have started voting.”\nBut a voter there said voting came to a halt after the thugs left with ballot materials.\nOsun: Voters apathy\nThere was apathy in the presidential election in Osun State as the exercise was characterized by low turnout of voters.\nHowever, Governor Rauf Aregbesola, who voted at 12.51 p.m. at unit 001, ward 08, Ifofin area, Ilesa, expressed a different view, saying the outcome of the election at the end of the day would justify whether people turned out for the exercise or not, stressing that most voters only got to the poll centres late.\nThe governor, who expressed delight at the security situation in the state during the election, said, “The security situation in Osun today was excellent. Osun would have won award for being the most peaceful state during this year’s elections but for the unfortunate incidence of last week where some people including a pastor were killed.”\nEdo: ACN members vote Jonathan\nTHE presidential election in Edo State witnessed large turn out and peaceful conduct with political leaders in the state describing it as a great improvement from the last weekend’s National Assembly elections.\nThere was no reported case of violence in the state and the presence of the military at strategic areas in the state immensely helped in ensuring security. Election materials arrived the units as early as 6:30a.m. while accreditation commenced at 8 a.m. Sunday Vanguard observed that the Action Congress of Nigeria (ACN) members were voting for Jonathan.\nGovernor Adams Oshiomhole; former Governor Lucky Igbinedion; Chief Tony Anenih; vice-presidential candidate of the All Nigeria Peoples Party (ANPP), Chief John Odigie Oyegun; minister of state for works, Dr Chris Ogienwonyi; former deputy governor and Edo State coordinator for Jonathan/Sambo campaign, Lucky Imasuen and the former chief whip of the Senate, Senator Rowland Owie, hailed the conduct of the election by INEC and expressed optimism that the best candidate will emerge.\nOshiomhole, who spoke after casting his vote at his ward 10, unit 1,Iyamho Primary School, Etsako Central Local Government Council, said: “ I believe that, today, INEC has improved substantially. No body complained about not finding his name in the register or that I wanted to vote but some body blocked me. And I think the security agents have also been fantastic. They conducted themselves in a very civil manner”.\nAnenih asserted:”The election is very peaceful. Turn out very impressive. Security arrangement is perfect. INEC arrangement is perfect; it has been an impressive free and fair election”.\nIgbinedion predicted victory for Jonathan, saying that “ as a son of the South-South, it is Jonathan and the PDP all the way”. Oyegun, who commended the turn out, stated: “Today’s election was better organized than that of the National Assembly. I am happy that the complaint we made last time as regards omission of names of persons who registered has been corrected.”\nDelta: Gun battle as PDP, DPP youths clash\nGUNSHOTS boomed, Friday night, at Ugborikoko, Effurun, near Warri in Uvwie Local Government Area of Delta State following a clash between suspected political thugs of the PDP and Democratic Peoples Party, DPP.\nSunday Vanguard learnt that some vehicles were destroyed during the fracas but no life was lost. However, the incident has heightened the tension between the two political parties ahead of the April 26 governorship election.\nA source said trouble started when some youths, suspected to be DPP faithful, accosted Governor Emmanuel Uduaghan, who held a meeting with some Ugborikoko chiefs at the home of Chief Joel Akporehe, to solicit the votes of the people for the April 26 election.\nIt was gathered that some DPP youths insisted they were not carried along by the elders and demanded “settlement” from the governor, as the area is purportedly a DPP territory.\nAccording to the source, the governor was harassed by the youths and when the information got to PDP youths, they mobilized and stormed the area in search of the DPP “boys” that harassed the governor.\nHell was practically let loose, as both sides exchanged gunfire and vehicles were destroyed.\nMeanwhile, trading activities at the Ughelli main market was in full swing during yesterday’s presidential election.\nOur correspondent who monitored the election in Ughelli North, Ughelli South, Ethiope East, Isoko North, Isoko South and Bomadi local government areas reported that the election was peaceful in the areas.\nBallot materials were distributed to various wards and polling units as early as 7:00a.m. in Ughelli and accreditation of voters started about 8a.m. Unlike what happened during the April 9 National Assembly elections, there was no single incident of ballot box snatching in the areas.\nAt Otu-Jeremi, Ughelli South local government, the state deputy governor, Prof Amos Utuama, SAN, who voted at 12:10 p.m. at unit 4, Jeremi ward II, said the large turnout of eligible voters was a reflection of the support the people of Delta have for Jonathan.\nThe state commissioner for lands, survey and urban development, Chief Fred Majemite, the member representing Ughelli South local government in the state House of Assembly, Olorogun Taleb Tebite, former managing director of the Niger Delta Development Commission, NDDC, Chief Emmanuel Aguariavwodo, and former commissioner for local government and chieftaincy affairs in the state, Dr Ebenezer Okorodudu, who also spoke to newsmen separately, spoke in the same vein.\nThey attributed the peaceful conduct of the election to the absence of opposition to the president in Delta, adding that about 80% of the political parties in the state had a consensus to vote for him.\n10 election observers of the Transition Monitoring Group, TMG, who were held hostage by youths of some communities in the state during penultimate Saturday’s presidential poll, were handed over to the police at the Koko Police Station, Koko in Warri North local government area of Delta state, later yesterday.\nDelta coordinator of TMG, Oghenejabor Ikimi, told Sunday Vanguard at 4.00 p.m. that information reached him indicated that the observers were brought to Koko police station, Koko, where they were detained for unknown reasons.\nHe gave the names of the arrested observers as Okotie-Eboh Samuel, Okuboye Jimmy, Iweha Charles, Dukuye Edirin, Ogbe Collins, Adams Okiemute, Isaac Lucky, Osadjere Paul, Ohowojero Samuel and Lucky Anayifek.\nIkimi said he was surprised that the election observers were made to pass through such ordeal when they wore TMG vests and had with them identity cards of the body, which were shown to their captors.\nContacted on the matter, the Delta State police spokesman, Mr. Charles Muka, that the matter was being addressed.\nCross River: Peaceful poll\nIn Cross River State, Governor Liyel Imoke described the presidential election as peacefully conducted throughout the state devoid of any report of thuggery or any form of disorder.\nImoke, who was accompanied by his wife, Obioma, stated this while fielding questions from news men shortly after casting his vote at the Government Primary School, Itigidi, Abi Local Government Area, declared that” the election is very very peaceful, election is very orderly and very credible”.\nRivers: Large turnout, youths unruly\nThe presidential election was almost marred in ward 10, Ahoada East local government area of Rivers State when some youths stopped INEC officials for several hours from distributing materials for the election.\nThe youths said until they were settled by politicians in the area, the election would not hold. The state REC, Mr Aniedi Ikoiwak, who lamented the action of the youths, wondered what they meant by “they had not been settled by politicians from the area. “\nIt took intervention of security operatives before accreditation could commence in the ward.\nThere was shortage of ballot papers at Eligbolo ward 7, Unit 3. Voters generally turned enmasse for the exercise. Accreditation started early in several wards visited.\nKwara: Strongman of politics stays away, 14 ACN members detained\nTurnout was low in Ilorin, Kwara State capital, and other major cities in the state even as the election was generally peaceful.\nAlso,the security agents enforced restriction of movement.\nMeanwhile, heavily armed military men invaded Iludun Oro in the Irepodun local government area of the state on Friday night to arrest 15 members of ACN including Kwara South Senatorial candidate, Mr Aanu Ibiwoye, over clash between the supporters of the party and those of the PDP.\nIbiwoye, who spoke on the development, said he was released in the wee hours of yesterday on his personal recognition, saying fourteen others were still in detention.\nContacted, the state Police Public Relations Officer, Mr. Dabo Ezekiel, confirmed the arrest.\nMeanwhile, the strongman of Kwara politics, Dr Olusola Saraki, shunned the election, but Governor Bukola Saraki and the gubernatorial candidate of ACPN, Senator Gbemisola Ruqqayat Saraki, did their accreditation and voted at different times at the same polling booth at Opobiyi in Agbaji ward.\nGovernor Saraki, shortly after casting his vote, described the exercise as successful.\nIn his remarks after casting his vote in his Emir’s road family compound the ACN governorship candidate in the state, Alhaji Mohammed Dele Belgore (SAN), said the exercise though peaceful has a very low turn out of the electorate.\nGbemisola Saraki whose party did not have a presidential candidate stressed that she had the right to vote for any candidate of her choice.\nAbia: Hundreds fail to vote\nTHE presidential election went smoothly in Abia State. Reports from across the state said the turn out was impressive. There was a general remarkable improvement on the performance of INEC.\nIn Umuahia, after Governor Theodore Orji voted at about 12.30 p.m. at his Ugba Community School Polling Unit, he expressed happiness at the impressive turn-out.\nAlso, after voting Unit 5, Central School, Umukabia, Umuahia North Council, a PDP chieftain, Chief Ikechi Emenike, noted that there was great improvement from what the nation witnessed in 2007, but “I think it is not yet Uhuru for the country”.\nAt the same Umukabia, a lot of voters, including old men and women who came out, could not vote. According to them, over 400 people from the unit could not vote because INEC moved their names to a polling unit at Umuosu, Okaiga Nkwoegwu, which has about 21 persons who registered. They called INEC to rectify the anomaly to enable them vote.\nNiger: 13 underaged voters held\nIn Niger State, accreditation and voting were smooth.\nThe turnout of eligible voters, especially in Minna, the state capital, was large.\nHowever, in some villages visited, including Konapi Unit in Kampala Ward, Area Court Polling Unit, Maikunkele in Bosso local government area, Primary 1&2 Polling Unit Beji, and Hausawan Unit at Zungeru Ward in Wushishi local government area of the state, there was low turnout especially the females and many underaged had a field day as they were accredited and allowed to vote.\nMeanwhile, the state commissioner of police, Alhaji Bala Hassan, arrested 13 underaged (names withheld) in Minna, attempting to vote.\nNiger State police spokesman, Richard Oguche said that besides being arrested, their parents will be traced and will be held criminally liable.\nThe arrested underaged will be prosecuted at the juvenile court tomorrow.\nAkwa Ibom: Tight security\nIn Akwa Ibom State, the presidential election was conducted under a peaceful atmosphere, even as soldiers were absent on major roads in Uyo, the state capital where security was largely provided by anti-riot policemen.\nHuman and vehicular movements were\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"http://www.vanguardngr.com/2011/04/amid-presidential-poll-monitors-allege-intimidation-underage-voting/","2":"3625","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999694824"},{"0":"Abubakar Malami (SAN) . Photo by Gbemiga Olamikan\nBy Anthony Ogbonna\nThe Federal Government, Wednesday, agreed it would publish the names of treasury looters as ordered by the Federal High court in Lagos today so Nigerians can see.\nMinister of Justice and Attorney-General of the Federation, Mr. Abubakar Malami, disclosed this to State House correspondents on Wednesday after the Federal Executive Council meeting.\nAccording Malami, the President Muhammadu Buhari-led Federal Government totally agrees with the ruling of the court and hence, will carry out the order as long as it does not amount to violation of the rules of the court.\nRecall that the Hon Justice Hadiza Rabiu Shagari-led Lagos Federal High Court had, in a ruling, ordered the Federal Government to “immediately release to Nigerians information about the names of high ranking public officials from whom public funds were recovered and the circumstances under which funds were recovered, as well as the exact amount of funds recovered from each public official.”\nThe judgement followed a Freedom of Information suit number: FHC/CS/964/2016 brought by Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) against the Federal Government.\nIn her judgment Justice Shagari had agreed with SERAP that “the Federal Government has a legally binding obligations to tell Nigerians the names of all suspected looters of the public treasury past and present.”\nJoined as Defendants in the suit are the Minister of Information Alhaji Lai Muhammed and the Federal Ministry of Information and Culture. Justice Shagari also granted the following reliefs:\nA DECLARATION that by virtue of the provisions of Section 4 (a) of the Freedom of Information Act 2011, the Defendants are under a binding legal obligation to provide the Plaintiff with up to date information relating to the following:\nTo widely disseminate including on a dedicated website information about the names of high ranking public officials from whom public funds were recovered since May 2015 The circumstances under which stolen public funds were returned.\nSERAP is now processing a certified true copy of the judgment.\nTimothy Adewale, SERAP deputy director who argued the case on behalf of SERAP and was in court this morning when the judgment was delivered said “This is a victory for justice, rule of law, transparency and accountability in this country. The judgment shows the way forward in the fight against corruption and impunity of perpetrators. We will do everything within the law to ensure full compliance by President Mohammadu Buhari and Acting President Osinbajo with this landmark judgment.\nIt would be recalled that the Ministry of Information last year published details of the recoveries, which showed that the Nigerian government successfully retrieved total cash amount N78,325,354,631.82, $185,119,584.61, £3,508,355.46 and €11, 250 between May 29, 2015 and May 25, 2016. Also released were recoveries under interim forfeiture, which were a combination of cash and assets, during the same period: N126,563,481,095.43, $9,090,243,920.15, £2,484,447.55 and €303,399.17.\nAnticipated repatriation from foreign countries totalled: $321,316,726.1, £6,900,000 and €11,826.11. The ministry also announced that 239 non-cash recoveries were made during the one-year period. The non-cash recoveries are – farmlands, plots of land, uncompleted buildings, completed buildings, vehicles and maritime vessels.\nSubsequently, SERAP issued an FOI request and gave the Minister of Information, Alhaji Lai Muhammed 14 days to disclose the names of all suspected looters.\nThe request reads in part: “While we believe that suspects generally are entitled to be presumed innocent until proven guilty by a court of competent jurisdiction, SERAP opposes blanket non-disclosure of names of high-ranking public officials from whom some of the funds were recovered.”\n“SERAP insists that the public interest to know is greater than any other legitimate interest that the government might wish to protect. The Nigerian government has an obligation to balance whether the risk of harm to the legitimate aim (that is secrecy of ongoing corruption investigation and presumption of innocence) from disclosure of the names of public officials is greater than the public interest in accessing the information.”\n“According to public interest test, even if the government demonstrates that the publication of the names of public officials would substantially harm a legitimate interest, it is nevertheless obliged to disclose the requested information if, as it is the case here, the public interest in disclosure is sufficient enough to overweigh the harm.”\n“SERAP believes that the recoveries, specifically from high-ranking public officials (and not private individuals), are matters of public interest. Publishing the names of those public officials will provide insights relevant to the public debate on the ongoing efforts to prevent and combat a culture of grand corruption and the longstanding impunity of perpetrators in the country.”\n“The gravity of the crime of grand corruption, the devastating effects on the socially and economically vulnerable sectors of the population, and the fact that recovery of huge funds from high-ranking public officials entrusted with the public treasury raise a prima-facie case and therefore amount to exceptional circumstances that justify naming those high-ranking officials in the public interest.”\n“SERAP also argues that Nigerians are entitled to the right to truth derived from the obligations of the government to carry out an investigation of violations of human rights and crime of corruption committed within its jurisdiction; to identify, prosecute and punish those responsible; and to ensure that victims have the simple and prompt recourse for protection against violation of fundamental rights, as well as to ensure transparency in public administration.”\n“SERAP believes that the right to truth allows Nigerians to gain access to information essential to the fight against corruption and in turn development of democratic institutions as well as provides a form of reparation to victims of grand corruption in the country.”\n“Publishing the names of public officials involved could go a long way in preventing senior public officials from turning the public treasury into a private cashbox. SERAP argues that the public interest in publishing the names of the high-ranking government officials from whom funds were received outweighs any considerations to withhold the information, as there would be no prejudice against those whose names are published as long as the information is appropriately framed and truthful.”\n“There is a general public interest in promoting transparency, accountability, public understanding and involvement in the democratic process. While the government in some limited cases can legitimately place restrictions on the public’s right to access certain information, attempts of the Nigerian authorities to justify the total closure of information related to the names of public officials from whom funds were recovered on the basis of “ongoing criminal investigation” and “presumption of innocence goes far beyond the limitations allowed under international law, and would promote secret recoveries.”\n“The information being requested is not related to detailed investigatory activities of anticorruption agencies regarding the recoveries so far made. Similarly, the mere fact that the information being requested is related to ongoing investigation does not necessarily mean that the information could not be disclosed. In addition, governmental agency has the obligation to prove that the disclosure of the names of public officials would disrupt, impede, or otherwise harm the ongoing or pending investigations or presumption of innocence.”\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"http://www.vanguardngr.com/2017/07/breaking-well-publish-names-of-looters-fg/","2":"1594","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999790192"},{"0":"THE Obaseki family of Benin Kingdom, headed by the retired Justice of the Supreme Court, Justice Otutu Obaseki, has distanced itself from the activities of Pedro Obaseki, reiterating the resolve of the family to back Godwin Obaseki.\nA statement signed by Mr. William Obaseki, described the action of Pedro as shameful and embarrassing to the family, adding that the family will soon meet to decide their next line of action.\nPedro Obaseki had recently defected to the PDP and declared his support for the governorship candidate of the PDP, Pastor Ize-Iyamu to the chagrin of the family members.\nBut reacting swiftly, the family said “We wish to inform the general public that the family disassociates themselves from the mischievous actions of Pedro Obaseki.\n“We hereby reaffirm Godwin Enogheghase Obaseki as the only recognized candidate who has the blessings of the head of Obaseki Ogbeideoyoo family, Chief Justice Andrew Otutu Obaseki, Justice of the Supreme Court (RTD) and the Obaseki of Benin Kingdom for the September 10, 2016, governorship election.\n“And we urge all Edo sons and daughters to support him so that he can take Edo State to the next level.

recovery plan in December\nInsists on $29.9b loan in meeting with Saraki\nFollowing two days of brainstorming in Abuja, various teams drawn from the public and private sector have concluded work on various aspects of a new and comprehensive economic blueprint for Nigeria.\nMinister of Budget and National Planning, Senator Udo Udoma whose ministry organized the retreat stated that contrary to critics’ misleading opinion that the federal government lacks an economic programme, President Muhammadu Buhari had laid out one in his 2016 Budget speech.\nAccording to the minister, the president’s economic vision, the Strategic Implementation Plan drawn up by his ministry along with vibrant ideas canvassed or analysed at the retreat would be harmonised and launched as the federal government’s comprehensive economic development programme next month.\n“It is helpful to note that the National Economic Recovery and Growth Plan will play a signalling role, while also promoting coherence and coordination.\n“In other words, by putting government strategies, directions, policy priorities and intended initiatives in one place, other stakeholders are better able to take their own strategic economic decisions.\n“In addition, economic actors in various sectors will be guided by commonly derived objectives in the plan which promote coordination and prevent duplication and needless dissipation of scarce resources.\n“The planning process also provides an opportunity to review the trajectory of the economy, especially in the context of regional and global developments,” Senator Udoma stated.\nAccording to him, the federal government’s focus on stimulating and revitalising the Nigerian economy is yielding positive results already, especially through the reforms in agriculture, stimulated investment in the solid minerals sector and the ‘Made in Nigeria’ campaign.\nHe noted that government’s identification of 45, 000 ghost workers through the Treasury Single Account and the liberalization of fuel supply which curbed daily consumption by 30% and saved $4. 5 million daily expenditure through elimination of false subsidy claims are among the recent economic gains.\nPointing out that Nigeria has been grappling with the ‘triple shock of prices, production and power’ for most of 2016, he stated that economic recession, collapse of oil prices and the vandalisation of oil pipelines that has a negative effect on electricity and gas supplies are serious challenges.\nHe said that the two-day retreat was conceptualised to provide an opportunity for stakeholders from the various sectors of the economy to consult and exchange views on the medium-term economic plan and facilitate enduring macroeconomic stability, economic diversification, ease business competitiveness, enhance social inclusion and assess governance processes towards enhancing rapid economic growth.\nAmong government officials present at the retreat, along with private sector players were the Minister of Mines and Steel Development, Mr. Kayode Fayemi, Minister of State, Petroleum Resources, Dr. Ibe Kachikwu, Minister of State for Health, Dr. Alhassan, Permanent

Ahmed Tanimu has surfaced wherein the varsity don is alleged to have confirmed that Senator Dino Melaye is a “bonifide graduate of ABU Zaria who has his genuine transcript and certificate.”\nIn the alleged confirmation claimed to be from the varsity’s Dean, Bar. Tanimu, the don is said to have stated that although Senator Dino had not wanted to graduate from the school, the institution, however, graduated him and his likes so that “peace may reign.”\nWhatever is meant by the statement “so that peace may reign” could not be ascertained.\nMelaye is a Senator representing Kogi West in the Senate on the platform of the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC.\nRecall that Melaye has been embroiled in certificate scandal since Sahara Reporters, an online media platform, published report that the lawmaker never graduated from Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria, where he attended his first degree course.\nThe development court the Senate attention Tuesday, leading to its decision to refer the matter to its Ethics and Privileges Committee for investigation ,when Senator Ali Ndume, APC, Borno South, brought up the issue during plenary.\nThe committee was directed to investigate the claim that he does not possess an authentic first degree certificate from the Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria.\nDuring the day’s plenary presided by the Deputy Senate President, Ike Ekweremadu, the upper legislative chamber decided to conduct the investigations, following a point of order raised by ousted Senate Leader, Senator Ali Ndume, who noted that both issues, raised by the online medium, borders on the privileges of the senators.\nHowever, according to the confirmation making the rounds on social media, “Dino is a graduate of ABU Zaria. I do not like him but the campaign of calumny and falsehood against him must stop. I recalled a meeting with the then VC, chief security officer Mallam Ashiru.”\n“At the meeting it was resolved that all politically exposed students and unionist must be graduated for peace to reign in ABU.\n“The VC started by asking me, the then SECGEN ABUSUG, when am I supposed to graduate? I told him I was only in 4 hundred level law then, he then asked after so many other commrades like Anslem, Chris, Ochums, Arokoyo, Ribadu, Renshaw, Kamal, Ntom, SB, Bright, Ganzi, Kombitel, Realman, Kurfi, Kabir Mustspha, Tijani Kabir(refused to graduate and 8 years later became NANS president), Precious Abdul, MB Mustspha, Dino etc……he gave a marching order that the Dean student affairs must ensure that our types are promptly graduated and leave the school in peace and in good time. Refering to all the so called elders and Unionist of ABU then.”\nThe case of Elder Dino as he then was, was even the worst. In truism, Dino never wanted to graduate from ABU. He was benefiting handsomely and almost feeding from Unionism like many Unionist, he deliberately keep having carry-overs so as to remain in ABU against the orders of the VC.\nTrust the smart VC Mahdi, he ensured that Dino swiftly passed all his carry-overs. When Dino resisted that move by the VC, he was told by the Dean that the University has the power to pass and graduate any of it’s students if they are satisfied that such a student has attained sufficient learning or good character standing(whether he actually pass all his papers or not).”\n“In Dino’s case, the emphasis was placed on his good character and not necessarily the waived passing.”\n“I repeat, Dino is a bonifide graduate of ABU Zaria, Department of Geography and Faculty of Social Science. He has his genuine transcript and certificate. He might have been exempted from NYSC as he was an adult even when in school.”\nRecall also that Senator Melaye, while determined to prove that he was awarded a Bachelors Degree by the Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria, has on Thursday, pledged to tender his certificate before a High Court of the Federal Capital Territory sitting at Maitama, Abuja in a N5 billion libel suit he brought against SaharaReporters.\nIn the suit he filed through his lawyer, Mr. Mark Ikongbeh, Senator Melaye, insisted that he indeed bagged a B. Sc in Geography from the University. He told the court that the certificate scandal has exposed him to great psychological stress and emotional trauma, saying he has been abandoned by his friends and associates owing to the defamatory publication by the defendants.\nCited as 1st to 4th defendants in the suit marked M/4812/17, were, the Incorporated Trustees of Sahara Reporters Media Foundation, Omoyele Sowore, Temitope Olumuyide and Sahara Reporters Media Group Inc. Aside praying the court to award him N5billion as aggravate and exemplary damages for libel, the plaintiff also applied for an injunction restraining the defendants, by themselves or by their servants or agents, from making further publications on the issue.\nHe is equally seeking N10million as cost of the legal action. In the statement of claim, the plaintiff told the court that a great number of his constituents, friends, associates, foreign acquaintances have felt so betrayed and let down by conducts maliciously and falsely alleged against him by the defendants, to an extent that they have ostracised him and have currently given him a wide berth.\nHe said: “Many invitations to honourable events have been withdrawn and attempts to reach out to several people who had very cordial relations with the plaintiff has been met with a cold shoulder. “The plaintiff has suffered great psychological stress and emotional trauma by reason of the defamatory publications arising from the loss of company he has suffered from friends and associates.\n“This precarious psychology state has been exacerbated by the number of people whom the plaintiff has had to reach out to or who have reached out to him for explanation and reassurance of the truth in the situation. “The plaintiff has greatly been weighed down emotionally by the sudden loss of huge public goodwill which he enjoyed prior to the publication of the defamatory publication.\n“Further, the defendants published the defamatory words out of malevolence and spite towards the plaintiff and with a view to cower the plaintiff into soft pedalling on his stance in several issues ongoing in the Senate chambers”.\nIn a 15-paragraphed affidavit that was personally deposed by the plaintiff, he averred: “That I am a Senator of the Federal Republic of Nigeria representing Kogi West Senatorial District of Kogi State and I was once the honourable member of the House of Representatives representing the Kabba/Bunu/Ijumu Federal Constituency.\nAmongst other duties; I currently serve as the Chairman of the Senate Committee on the FCT. “The 1st defendant is an organisation setup under Part C of the companies and Allied Matters Act as a non-profit organisation ostensibly dedicated to promoting a brand of investigative journalism pioneered by the 4th defendant.

My friend, we need to know from youâ€. Those were questions that have bombarded me since the Eagles made their exit from the first World Cup in Africa. Many people especially Journalists and the people of South Africa would not let anybody rest once they notice you are a Nigerian.\nFor the foreign media, we have to know ourselves through interactions either from the media centre or the media tribune or from the mixed zones where we meet in the course of getting stories for our different organisaions. I know that many Nigerians by now have come to terms with the sour performance of the Eagles but out here, mentions are still being made to the early exit of the Eagles.\nOne British Journalists said that he has never seen such a miss in the whole of his 39 years of writing sports and covering many international competitions. He was referring to Yakubuâ€™s miss. In the 66th minute of\nTuesdayâ€™s final group match against South Korea, trailing 2-1 and needing a win to have a shot at advancing,Â striker Yakubu was set up with an absolutely perfect opportunity right in front of the goal. With the keeper sprawled out beside him and a wide open net waiting to be fed the ball, Yakubu tried to flick the pass in for the astonishingly easy score and he put it wide off the post. He missed.\nI still donâ€™t think it was possible, but he missed. Well, he did hit a water bottle, but that doesnâ€™t count for anything. Since then, I have not rested for the silly mistake of Yak. He has made me to be answering questions that I donâ€™t know. Nigerians and Africans, too, have been attributing the miss to Native Doctors, or a spell. One said boldly that it was not for nothing that he missed the chance. I am not an authority in such mundane trivial things of â€˜tyingâ€™ the playersâ€™ legs as is being suggested here. Some claimed that some native doctors were\nferried to South Africa from Nigeria by Nigerians to ensure that Sani Lulu and his group of traveling members in the NFA do not use the glory of the World Cup by the Eagles to climb back to the glass house. Others have insinuated that it is retribution. That the Eagles and NFA and indeed Nigerians reaped what they sowed by kicking out Amodu Shuaibu from his post after suffering to qualify Nigeria for the World Cup.\nI learnt that Amodu was at the World Cup but did not set my eyes on him. I thanked God that I did not see him because I would not have faced him for an interview. Yes! How could I have done that or what question could I have asked him knowing his temper.\nI didnâ€™t want to be like Onochie Anibeze who faced the wrath of Emmanuel Okala after Rangers International were defeated by the then Leventis United. Rangers had played the match of their lives and controlled every aspect of the match. Rain suddenly started falling and a harmless shot, the type that Goalkeeper Robert Green of the Three Lions of England conceded against USA was fired by Leventis.\nThe goalkeeper bent to hold the ball and it slipped into the net for the only goal of the match. Rangers officials and players wept. And as a cub reporter Onochie went straight with his tape recorder to Okala and asked, â€œCoach what would you attribute to the defeat? Okala in his giant size seized Onochie by the collar of his shirt and lifted him up, retorting in Ibo. â€œina attribute, ifuro rain? It means, â€œAre you attributing, didnâ€™t you see rain? By the time he hauled Onochie down, he had a stiff neck. I still remember that incident as if it happened yesterday.\nAnd I thanked God that I did not see Amodu because I wouldnâ€™t have avoided the urge to ask him questions. Why that happened in those years, now mistakes by keepers and strikers are being attributed to the Jabulani; the official ball of the World Cup in South Africa.\nPlayers who shoot wide pass the blame on the jabulani while goalkeepers who fumbled point at the Jabulani. Yakubu has not said anything on his infamous miss but donâ€™t be surprised that one day he would either blame the jabulani or agree that external forces misdirected the ball from the yawning net. I still wonder why the Nigerian Television Authority stopped one kiddies program called Tales by moonlight. Such excuses or blames on external forces or spiritual attacks, frankly, are nothing but tales by moonlight. Even though that Friday Nwankwo Kuja a.k.a Ambassador swore that many people cursed the FA members and some of the players because of their greed and cheating innocent people.\nFunny, funny identity!\nI donâ€™t know if you still remember one of the classics done by Oliver de Coque? The late high life musician who lifted the burden of Nigerians with his music. If you do, then, you must know about funny, funny identity. Part of the track says, â€œsometimes when I dress, I dress like boyoyo, sometimes when I dress, I dress like Chief of Kings. I been get beer-beer, my beer bear is from nature, music is my talent, thatâ€™sÂ my identity.\nEh weeee, mama mo, funny, funny identityâ€.Â Our Entertainment Editor, Ogbonna Amadi still has it as his ring tone in his phone. But the funny, funny identity of the world cup is coming from the President of the Nigerian Supporters Club, worldwide, Dr Rafiu Ladipo. Ladipo is designed with tribal marks on his face. He wouldnâ€™t have allowed his parents toÂ mutilate his face if he had the choice. If you know our Photo Editor, Joseph Akintola, then, you know what I am talking about. He too has s designerâ€™s mark on his face.\nBut then, such marks were the identity of the Yorubas, Once you see any man or woman with marks you know where he or she is coming from. But while in Primary School, we had a Yoruba boy called Ebenezer. He too was heavily designed with tribal marks. He was huge and feared by all. We were told that he fought with a Lion and killed the king of the jungle with his bare hands. That it was during the battle that he got the marks. And since then, he had learnt to be humble by genuflecting while greeting people.\nI didnâ€™t know if he knew about the tales but enjoyed it when people carried out his orders.Â Things have changed. I would have wished that they still draw marks on their faces especially my friends who are so fine and deprive me from things. If they had marks(tribal or from the Lion), I would have been the king of the jungle in their midst. Anyway! Dr Ladipo told me that he would be going back to Nigeria since the Eagles have been kicked out of the World Cup.\nHe would have loved to stay in this beautiful country till the end of the world cup. But his tribal marks give him away as a Nigerian. People ask him annoying questions on what he is still doing around after their team lost. He bemoaned his tribal marks and said that if he had fine face like me, he would have stayed back.\nWe all laughed, Then I took a closer look on his face and wanted to count the number of lines on his face. He was talking andÂ always moving his head. I lost count.\nAt a stage I started getting dizzy following his head. It made me remember during our WAEC exam how one boy who got an expo wrote the answers on the ceiling fan. The questions were OBJ(I donâ€™t mean our former farmer President). He would read question one, and looked up to see if the answer was a, b or c and he would circle it. But a vigilant teacher who was watching him went and switched on the fan. As the fan was rotating, our friend was rotating his head to get his answer. He complained that he was cold but majority of the students said that they were sweating, unaware of what was happening. He continued moving his head to the rotation of the fan until he slumped. There was commotion in the hall. We thought he was suffering from epilepsy until the Teacher poured water on him and revived him. Then, he switched off the fan and showed us all his writings on the blades of the fan. That man is a Medical Doctor, now.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"http://www.vanguardngr.com/2010/06/28/is-it-a-curse-or-sabotage/comment-page-2/#comment-257696","2":"1878","3":"Sports","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999637604"},{"0":"By Ikechukwu Nnochiri\nABUJA—Justice Audu Bako, a member of the panel hearing petition seeking to annul the election victory of Governor Ibrahim Gaidam of Yobe State, is dead.\nVanguard learned that Justice Bako died around 2p.m. yesterday at Primus Hospital, Karu, a suburb in Abuja, after a brief illness.\nHe was buried in his home town, Nasarawa, Nasarawa State, according to Islamic rites.\nBako was a member of the three-member panel of Yobe State Governorship Election Petitions Tribunal that had, on August 12, heard how Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, traced the origin of N15 million that was lodged into the bank accounts of a Resident Electoral Commissioner.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"http://www.vanguardngr.com/2015/08/yobe-election-tribunal-judge-dies/#sthash.0I9wMtHn.dpuf","2":"182","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.998516202"},{"0":"Oyegun, Tinubu and Buhari\nSIMON EBEGBULEM, BENIN-CITY\nChief John Odigie-Oyegun, the National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), in this interview, says his party is not worried about a mega party said to be in the pipeline and allegedly being formed to rival APC, saying his party will win the 2019 presidential election.“He also speaks on many other issues, including his planned meeting with the National Leader of the APC, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu.\nEconomic recession is biting harder, particularly in this festive period. How do you see the situation as the National Chairman of the ruling party?\nI hope it was low key, but what is important is that you could see signs of fun everywhere. Which means that inspite of everything, people are happy. That is not say that there is not some degree of belt tightening. I can feel it but what is also good is that people are still able to eat rice. We have become a bit of wasteful society; now we are being forced to adjust, measure the way we spend money. People hardly fly business class these days.\nThese are signs of growing realism, growing change, an acceptance that it can no longer be business-as-usual. But, personally, what made me glad this Christmas is the existence of local rice; we now have Ebonyi Rice and the Lake Rice. Nigerians are beginning to domesticate their taste in the local rice they prefer, which is very good.\nThe fact that there was so much in terms of quantity of local rice all over the place is something that makes me glad. It means that there was good harvest, and that, next year, for the fact that the market has now been established, it means we can even export rice. So, thank God, out of every seeming adversity, the good Lord opens windows of prosperity. I think we are at the start of a prosperous period, when this country will be depending not just on oil but on a broader base of production.\nAre you not scared that the recession may degenerate to depression?\nWe are working hard. We are not even thinking of depression, we are thinking of getting out of the recession that we are in. And all government policies and projects are geared towards getting this nation out of the recession as soon as possible. Perish the thought of depression, we will never get there. What is happening with rice now, the same thing is going to be replicated in the agricultural sector and, as soon as the power sector stabilizes, we will get industries like the textile kicking back into production. We can only look upward and not backward.\nYour party has been accused by the PDP of rigging recent elections that took place in the country. What is your view?\nAccusation of that nature is basically stupid and silly. Anybody who knows the President and what we stand for as a party and the true meaning of change, will notice that what is being done is that every effort is being made to create the atmosphere for Nigerians to exercise their fundamental right to choose in a free and unfettered atmosphere. But the reality on the ground is that there are still people who are not used to free and fair voting. That is why there is this strong presence of security to ensure that nothing untoward happens. Security was provided in Edo State during the election and we saw how it went without the loss of a single life. It happened in Ondo State where we had a free and fair and transparent voting without the loss of a single life.\nWe have the singular exception of Rivers State. And let us be honest with each other, Rivers is a state that truly never genuinely voted in the past, that is the reality. Port Harcourt, yes, there is a show of voting, in the past, but in the riverine areas, that was a totally different kettle of fish and, you know, if you are honest to Nigerians, you will know that people in the riverine areas of Rivers never voted in the past, these are areas where the PDP just wrote results. Buhari and APC this time ensured that people felt free enough to come out and exercise their voting right and, to do that, you have to massively police the area. And you can see that inspite of that there were still a lot of violence to the extent that police officers were beheaded. And if you read papers you will find that this violence is still going on in Rivers.\nYou have a government there that came into office, the verbal language of that government was one that is virtually saying that it is legitimate to employ violence. Speeches were being made that any INEC officer coming who does not dance to their tune should write his will before coming to operate in Rivers. You cannot have a situation like that in this country. When we campaigned, we had to be robust; why we were robust in our rhetorics was because we wanted to give people the courage to come out and vote. If you did not do that, they will say these are people that will just come and talk and go back and there won’t be anybody to protect them. So we tried to be robust to give the people the courage to come out in the knowledge that enough security had been put in place to protect them. So the accusation by anybody that the APC is rigging elections is silly and stupid and totally untenable.\nRumoured formation of mega party\nMega party, I don’t know where the name mega party suddenly came from in the lexicon of politics in this country. When two people gather to have a meeting, it is a mega meeting.\nWe don’t feel threatened; we will in fact encourage a mega party, because with the gradual collapse of the PDP, we want a party that can make us sit upright and be on our toes in terms of delivery of service to our people; a party that will make us feel challenged, that will make democracy real, offer the people a real choice.\nWe are not threatened at all, we are focused on our mission made difficult by the current economic situation worldwide, which of course is compounded with the collapse of the oil market. You will observe that I have held meetings with the National Assembly leadership, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar and we are waiting for the arrival of Asiwaju Tinubu who is outside the country. Once he comes back we intend to visit him and have meaningful discussion.\nWe are reforming this country, reforming it ethically, morally and economically by building a fresh economic base which will no longer depend on an extractive industry which does not involve the people.\nNow we are pushing agriculture, most Nigerians are in the field of agriculture. We are pushing extractive minerals which of course are virtually all over the country, a lot of Nigerians will be involved in that enterprise. We are pushing power generation and distribution because that will also energize the small and medium scale industry. So we want an economy in which most Nigerians are participants, it is no longer oil which is highly technologically based. So it is a different reality we are trying to build and establish. It involved sacrifices, hard work but what is necessary today is that we are focused. What is real today is that the government of Buhari is passionate about seeing this thing to its logical conclusion.\nThis nation must change and the change is so fundamental that there is no question at all that a lot of people are going through temporary hardship but the situation is such that, tomorrow, everybody will be glad that we pursued this line of development inspite of the problems we are facing currently. So we are not bothered about the rumoured formation of any new party.\nThe APC is solid enough to win any election including the 2019 presidential election. And I can tell you that some of these our leaders who they are using their names to talk about the new party thing is not true. Some mischief makers are trying to use their names to achieve their selfish interest. APC is intact, and that is the secret of our success so far.\nIt is a war that in the interest of this nation must be won. What has destroyed every facet of this country is corruption.\nWe had 16 years of PDP government; tell me one of the national problems that was ameliorated? Corruption was high, not that they wished the country ill but they were so corrupt that they did not see the need of focusing on development either of the citizens or institutions; everything today is in a total state of decay because of the corruption entrenched by the PDP. We must beat corruption, it may again mean taking a few short cuts.\nI know of course that the law to create special courts for corrupt people is under way but, as far as I am concerned, we should not allow the technicalities of the English legal system to hold back the reality. A man is getting half a billion Naira every month and you allow him to take ten SANs to go and argue the case, it will be difficult for the government to secure convictions. Why should a man get half a billion Naira every month and be buying houses for his children? This is my personal view, it has nothing to do with APC. We must beat corruption or corruption will beat Nigeria. Buhari has zero tolerance for corruption and we must end it this time.\nPeople see INEC as an appendage of the APC-led government. Are you not bothered?\nThat is part of the PDP propaganda. They talked about postponement of elections and cancellations; do you expect the Commission to go on with an election from security reports that said the election will be bloody? Let me tell you, in the Edo election, we knew the kind of thuggery the PDP wanted to unleash and the kind of resources the PDP states in the South-South allegedly deployed with a view to rigging the election here. States like Delta, Akwa Ibom, Rivers, which are the wealthiest states in the South-South allegedly brought money here to rig the Edo election. And INEC postponed the poll for security reasons and you know that the INEC work with the security agents to ensure credible election. And inspite of the long delay in the Rivers election we still did not get away with it violence free and that I must say is a major consideration. We don’t want lives lost because somebody wants to be in office, that is not acceptable. And that is why you see INEC shifting polls and you cannot blame them. We want elections but not bloodshed and you cannot blame the commission for trying to save lives.

But, at the same time, she has abstained from abusive outbursts against former Governor Nyesom Wike, who is Minister of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). Correspondent MIKE ODIEGWU reports\nWhen she was unveiled as the running mate to Siminialayi Fubara, the then governorship candidate of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) in Rivers State, Professor Ngozi Nma Odu, had dreamed of and prayed for two things; victory at the poll and a peaceful tenure as a deputy governor.\nUndoubtedly, Odu, born on October 23, 1952, in Ogba/Egbema/Ndoni Local Government Area, has her first prayer granted. She excelled at the 2023 election with her boss. But, the same thing cannot be said about her request for a peaceful, crisis-free and fulfilled tenure.\nOdu, who obtained her first degree in Microbiology from the Paisley College of Technology, Renfrewshire, Scotland, the United Kingdom (UK), watched as the substructure of a once united political family built by a former Governor Nyesom Wike, who is currently the Minister of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Abuja, began to collapse, following irreconcilable differences between Fubara and Wike, his erstwhile godfather.\nThe same family nominated and worked for her to become deputy governor. Her choice was unanimous. She was singlehandedly picked by Wike through the recommendations of former Governor Peter Odili.\nOdili is a key figure in modern Rivers politics who supported Wike throughout his tenure as his political father. He has also often been referred to as the political godfather of Odu. While Wike solely nominated Fubara and made him governor, the former governor out of respect for Odili reportedly asked the latter to recommend Fubara’s deputy. Without hesitation, Odili was said to have chosen Prof. Odu.\nOdu, a refined international scholar and first PhD graduate at the Department of Microbiology, University of Port Harcourt, was brought into politics by Odili. Under the administration of Odili, Odu was a permanent secretary in the Ministry of Health between 1999 and 2006, making her the longest-serving permanent secretary. She also rose to become the Commissioner for Education in January 2006.\nThe scholar, who led the rescue team of the December 2010 ill-fated Sosoliso crash in which only two people survived, owed her political loyalty to Odili. She was said to have developed a fondness for Wike, who used to pour encomiums on her publicly, especially during the campaigns.\nRead Also: Atiku as an endangered specie\nHow has Odu faired amidst the political crisis in Rivers? A peep into her activities shows that the professor has been discharging the functions of her office diligently. The nature of her office and Odili’s position in the impasse have helped Odu to define her feelings.\nThe office of a deputy governor has always been likened to a spare tyre. Just like her predecessor, Dr. Ipalibo Harry-Banigo, who is now the senator representing Rivers West, Odu has maintained a quiet mien. She has never made controversial political statements. Though she has maintained her loyalty to Fubara, she has never been heard casting aspersion on or verbally attacking Wike.\nShe has meticulously attended all programmes of the governor that required her presence. She has also been representing the governor in various events. In her public speeches, Odu has shown her complete loyalty to Fubara as required by her office.\nRecently at the 2024 Rivers Economic Summit, Prof. Odu described Fubara, whom she fondly refers to as her boss as a leader with the ability to inspire, motivate and encourage people to bring out the best in them. She said: “We thank him for conceiving the idea of this summit. He is a man of courage; a man of focus and a man, who puts Rivers people first.”\nSimilarly, when Prof. Odu received the Silverbird Man of the Year Award on behalf of Fubara, she wrote: “It was truly well-deserved for my boss to be recognized for his efforts in promoting peace and unity in our state. This award serves as a reminder of the importance of working towards a peaceful and harmonious society for the betterment of all.\n“I am proud to be a part of his team and to contribute to the progress and prosperity of our dear state. Thank you, Silverbird, for this recognition. We also thank everyone who has supported us in our mission for peace. Let us continue to strive for a world where peace and harmony prevail.”\nWhile refraining from making public statements about the crisis, Odu has shown nothing but complete loyalty to Fubara. For instance, during the governor’s birthday, Odu wrote: “Your excellency, as you celebrate your birthday today, it is my fervent prayers that the Almighty God shall continue to bless, protect, guide and keep you in good health and give you the wisdom to pilot the affairs of the state excellently.”\nApart from the nature of her office, a key factor that has propelled Odu to maintain unwavering loyalty to Fubara is that Odili has pitched his tent with Fubura right from the beginning of the crisis. The former governor chose to support the Fubura camp from the outset. He is said to be an active leader of the camp and the backbone of the governor in the crisis.\nIn the heat of the crisis, Odili has openly identified Fubara as the political leader of Rivers. He further remarked that Fubara had taken full control of his administration. He said: “The time for politics is over; it is now time for governance. You have done well by hitting the ground running. You have touched all sectors: education, agriculture, and now health. This is in line with Mr. President’s agenda.\n“Regard your office as key. Don’t look back. It is not a matter of age. What is important is that your people are with you. The Rivers State people said I should tell you that you are their political leader. Whatever you say stands and wherever you go they will follow.”\nFubara has also boasted that Odili’s membership of his camp was giving his enemies sleepless nights. Therefore, Prof. Odu naturally belongs to Odili’s camp and can flaunt her loyalty to Fubara without any doubt.\nDespite not having the peace she dreamed of, which her predecessor enjoyed, Odu has continued to discharge her responsibilities, guarding her utterances and demonstrating unalloyed loyalty to Fubara while showing gratitude for the roles Wike played by resisting the temptation to be drawn into abusive outbursts against the FCT minister.","1":"https://thenationonlineng.net/rivers-crisis-fubaras-deputy-walks-a-tightrope/","2":"1514","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999866486"},{"0":"TechPP - Technology Personalized\nDiscover the Secrets of Tech\nMaking Tech Simpler\nGet the best advice\nGet the best tech for your needs\nGet the most out of your tech\nVivo T3 Ultra review: It might come with a premium mid-segment price, but the Vivo T3 Ultra delivers close to a budget flagship performance and has the…\nOnePlus Nord Buds 3 Review: For ₹2,299 (₹2,099, including offers), the OnePlus Nord Buds 3 has impressive bass-heavy sound and effective noise cancellation that works.

In this regard, the need to ensure that thorough investigations are carried out by relevant law enforcement agencies cannot be overemphasized.”\nEven as the House of Representative in a unanimous vote approved all the recommendations of the report, the AGF noted that the exercise carried out by the legislature is “mainly fact-finding.” He further pointed out that the report of the ad-hoc committee and the resolutions adopted by the House of Representatives, were yet to be transmitted to the executive arm of government.\n“Nevertheless, when the report and accompanying resolutions are received, the relevant law enforcement and anti-corruption agencies will commence the tedious process of sieving through the report, with a view to assembling all the essential ingredients required to sustain criminal charges that may be filed as a result of such investigations” he added.\nLack of evidence\nReferring to recent flaws recorded by the anti-corruption agencies in the trial of some corrupt allegations, Mr Adoke stated that “experience has shown that whenever our law enforcement agencies are stampeded to arraign suspects, the end result is usually the discharge of such suspects by the courts ostensibly for want of evidence.”\n“Nigerians must therefore allow our law enforcement agencies to conduct painstaking investigations that will ultimately satisfy the standard of proof required in criminal cases.”\nHe however admitted that the allegations contained in the subsidy probe report deserve serious action on the part of all those with oversight responsibility over the agencies and persons concerned.\nHe urged Nigerians to have faith in the processes being undertaken and to patiently wait for the outcome of the investigations and subsequent prosecutions that may flow from the fuel subsidy probe and also the on-going probe by the Senate.\nMr Adoke also reached out to the Save Nigeria Group (SNG) that has given the government a two weeks ultimatum to commence the prosecution of all those indicted in the report; else they will call for a nationwide protest.\nThe AGF stated that the threat to embark on demonstrations and strike actions will only “compound the problem and divert attention, as well as, the energy that would otherwise have been channeled into productive use by law enforcement agencies”\nMr Adoke reiterated government’s commitment to anti-corruption as he recalled the President’s initial reaction to the Report of the Fuel Subsidy probe, saying that “any person found wanting will be prosecuted irrespective of the person’s standing in the society.”\nHe therefore enjoined all Nigerians who are concerned about the revelations from the fuel subsidy probe report to be “patient and exercise restraint while these difficult, but essential processes are carried out by appropriate agencies.”\n“As Attorney General of the Federation, I swore to uphold the Constitution and I am therefore not oblivious of the constitutional responsibility placed on my shoulders to ensure that those who contravene our laws are held accountable through the legal process” he stated.\nRead the Complete statement of the AGF here.","1":"http://www.channelstv.com/home/2012/05/03/those-indicted-by-subsidy-probe-report-will-not-be-prosecuted-minister-of-justice/?utm_source=&utm_medium=twitter","2":"770","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999961853"},{"0":"The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) on Thursday, produced Form CF001, containing WAEC-GCE certificate and Secondary School Testimonial of Gov.

National Chairman of INEC to produce Form CF001, after INEC in Osogbo office said the documents were not in it’s custody, but with its Headquarters in Abuja.\nLead Counsel to INEC, Prof. Paul Ananaba, informed the court that the order given had been complied with and that the documents had been brought from Abuja by Mrs Joan Arabs, a Deputy Director.\nArabs, thereafter, presented the documents to the court, which was admitted and afirmed that the documents had been produced in compliance to the order.\nHowever, Mr Lateef Fagbemi, Counsel to the petitioners (APC and Gboyega Oyetola), after going through the two pages documents, told the tribunal that the documents produced by INEC (Form CF001) were not legible and could not be used to prosecute their case.\nFagbemi pointed out that they paid N305,000 for the documents and that the first document, West African Examination Council (WAEC) – General Certificate of Examination (GCE), does not have anything/result details on it and that only the signature at the bottom was legible.\nHe also said that the second document, School Testimonial, obtained from Ede Muslim Grammar School by Adeleke, does not have the address or location of the school on it.\nFagbemi told the court that the documents could not be used or managed by them, saying that they were not clear and legible.\nThe petitioners’ counsel urged the tribunal to take note of their objections to the documents produced by INEC.\nKume upheld the objection of the petitioners and ruled that the respondent (INEC) had not fully complied with the tribunal’s order to produce Form CF001, saying that the documents produced were not legible.\nThe tribunal chairman then, ordered that INEC should produce a clearer and readable copies of the documents.\nINEC counsel, thereafter, asked the tribunal to allow it snap the documents in their custody in Abuja and forward same, so that the hearing could go on.\nKume then granted the request and gave a break of one hour 30 minutes for INEC to get the documents.\nAs the hearing continued after the break, Ananaba said INEC Abuja had made the screenshot of the copy of the documents, which he printed and presented to the tribunal.\nKume, however, said that the copies were not better than what the INEC Deputy Director brought.\nAfter the arguments and submissions from the petitioners and respondents’ counsel, they agreed that the original file containing the Form CF001, in INEC custody in Abuja, be brought to before the tribunal next week.\nThe tribunal chairman said it was unfortunate that the respondent (INEC) could bring unclear and blurred copies of the documents requested by the petitioner.\nHe said it was agreed that sittings shall be held week days, weekends and even, public holidays, from the on set of the Tribunal’s pre-hearing.\nKume then adjourned next hearing to Dec. 3, asking INEC to produce clean and clear copies of the original file containing Form CF001.\nHe said that if INEC

aegis of OurMumuDonDo movement.\nThe protest, which started last Monday, has seen the protesters asking President Muhammadu Buhari to either resume work or resign, following his over three months stay in London, United Kingdom, on medical vacation.\nThe police, however, disrupted the protest on Tuesday, on the grounds that it would be hijacked by hoodlums.\nBut Falana in a statement issued, Suday, gave instances where the President led protests as a private citizen without harassment or assault from the police.\nHe said: “It is pertinent to remind the presidency and the Nigeria Police Force that President Buhari had, in the recent past, taken part in peaceful rallies in Abuja to protest alleged manipulation of election results and perceived injustice in the country.\n“It is on record that as he exercised his fundamental rights to freedom of expression and assembly with other Nigerians on such occasions he was never subjected to any form of assault or intimidation by the police.”\nHe also urged the Inspector General of Police to apologise to leader of the protest, Charles Oputa,aka Charly Boy.\n“By providing ‘adequate security’ for the pro-Buhari demonstrators while harassing the anti-Buhari protesters the police engaged in the violation section 42 of the constitution, which has prohibited discrimination on grounds of political opinion.\n“To that extent, the authorities of the Nigeria Police Force should apologise to Mr. Charlie Oputa and other members of the ‘our mumu don do’.\n“No doubt, the violent disruption of the anti-Buhari rally ought to have embarrassed President Buhari who had advised President Yar’Adua, in a similar situation, to step aside as he could no longer discharge the duties and functions of his office.”\nHe gave the example of a September 2003 protest by the defunct All Nigeria People’s Party, ANPP, which was disrupted.\nHe said: “The police authorities justified the disruption by claiming that the organizers of the rally did not obtain a police permit.\n“Completely aggrieved by the action of the police, Muhammadu Buhari and other leaders of the ANPP instructed our law firm to sue the inspector general of police to justify the legal validity of asking for police permit before protesting against the government.”\nHe said the presiding judge of the case had identified protests as a recognised form of expression in

Do you see a continued poor service quality?\nService quality is a factor of so many things, including the ability to invest in infrastructure. We have moved from 2G to 2.5G and to 3G, 4G and 5G and all these technologies have positively impacted on the telecoms sector and other sectors of the economy.\nHowever, most times telecoms operators face insecurity challenges and threats to telecoms facilities and all these could affect not only service quality, but fast roll out of relevant facilities. If one telecom site is vandalised, it can cause ripple effect on other sites that are connected to it. Again if there is a cut on the backhaul transmission cable, it can adversely affect service quality. So we need uninterrupted telecoms facilities, including investments in telecoms infrastructure, in order to achieve faster, wider coverage and better service quality.\nThe Federal Government’s national broadband plan is to cover 90 per cent population and 70 per cent landmass by 2025. Where do operators like you stand in this plan?\nI am pleased with the bold ambition of government concerning broadband penetration. However, government alone cannot achieve it without contributions of industry players and stakeholders like VDT Communications. 90 per cent population coverage and 70 per cent landmass coverage by 2025 is a tall order but achievable through collaboration with industry stakeholders. To achieve the target, there must be increased investments from industry players.\nAlready, VDT is fast expanding its services to provide connectivity to more organisations and people. We have plans to further deepen our retail strategies and offerings to customers in the next five years. We are investing in broadband infrastructure to boost our retail and enterprise service offerings, and we are doing so in every state of the federation. Through our expansion plan, we will be covering more organisations and homes, thereby helping government to achieve its broadband target.\nThere was this Universal Services Provision Fund meant for operators to access in order to move services to the critical areas, why are we still talking about low coverage particularly in rural areas?\nThe Universal Service Provision Fund (USPF), which is being offered by the telecoms industry regulator, the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), is like the equalisation fund that we see in the petroleum industry. The USPF is meant for network expansion in rural and underserved communities, but most operators are only concentrating on urban areas where they can make quick returns on their investments.\nThe essence of USPF is to encourage operators to develop rural areas that may appear unprofitable at the moment. What the NCC did was to use certain percentage of the money from Annual Operating Levy (AOL) for USPF and only operators that are willing to invest in rural communities have access to the fund. VDT is expanding in some parts of the rural areas and we are working with NCC to achieve further expansion in the rural and under-served areas of our country.\nYou play in the data space, where revenue for data is fast growing while that of voice is depleting by the day. The bigger operators are beginning to shift operations to data. As a small industry player, is VDT threatened by the shift from bigger operators?\nThe revenue for voice did not actually drop. What dropped significantly is the rate of growth in the voice segment of the business, because technology evolution is beginning to compel people to do more of data than voice. For VDT, even though we are small industry operator, our business model has been centred on data from the very first day of our operations. So, we are not threatened by the incursion of bigger players into the data space.\nYou have played in the telecom sector for 20 solid years, tell us your story?\nMy motivation to become a player in the telecoms industry, providing bespoke telecoms services, started from my school days in the University of Ilorin, where I studied engineering. At my final year as an engineering student, I had the push and zeal, as a communication/computer student, to become a provider of communications services to people after graduating from the university. After graduating, I worked as computer engineer in an engineering company, handling systems integration and maintenance.\nFrom there, I developed the interest to build networks for customers, and ensuring that different computers align and connect with each other in a seamless communication flow. That was 36 years ago. Having seen my dreams come true, I applied for a licence to operate VDT Communications. At the onset in 2001, we started operations with 14 staff addressing just five points of services, but today we have grown to 400 staff, attending to 143 points of services across the 36 states of the federation.\nIn the last 20 years, it has not been easy doing business in Nigeria, but we remained focused in delighting our customers and meeting their needs. That, and other factors, have brought us this far.\nHow has the suspension of Twitter operations in Nigeria affected your business, since VDT plays in the data environment?\nVDT is a customer-centric organisation and our focus is on customers who use our connectivity services. We provide Virtual Private Network (VPN) for customers but that is strictly private to gain access to connectivity. We also have VPN servers in the cloud where people can log on to and get connectivity to carry out several online activities. So the suspension of Twitter operations in Nigeria is not affecting our business growth. We have built security around our networks to protect the data of customers. The Nigerian Data Protection Regulation (NDPR) is another policy that is helping to protect customers’ and organisations’ data.\nHow fair is the current Forex regime to your business?\nCommunication services involve different equipment not manufactured in Nigeria. So we are understandably import-dependent. This makes foreign exchange inevitable for us. But the strength of our Naira currently has been weakened against the dollar. This has raised the rate of Forex which of course is affecting our business in Nigeria. Since the Covid-19 pandemic, the Naira has lost its value the more and it is telling on importation of communication equipment because Forex has gone so high and access to Forex is even a nightmare. Before Covid-19, the value of Naira was N360 to $1, but today, it has jumped to over N500 to $1, which is now eating deep into our revenue.\nSo what’s the way forward?\nOn the interim, the government must give ample opportunities for telecoms and communications operators to have easy access to Forex. However, the lasting solution is for the government to protect and promote indigenous manufacturers of communication equipment so that importation of equipment will be drastically cut down.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"https://www.vanguardngr.com/2023/02/tinubu-holds-lowkey-rally-in-katsina-vows-to-defeat-terrorists/amp/Low","2":"1519","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999828339"},{"0":"The National Association of Nigerian Students(NANS) has called on the Academic Staff Union of Universities(ASUU) to stop its opposition to the Student Loan Programme.\nThe NEC of the union had on Thursday said ”Nigerians should be aware that the Loan scheme is a way of starving public universities of funding and a ploy to divert public funds into private universities owned by politically exposed individuals and their friends.”\nReacting to this, the President of the Senate, NANS, Dist. Sen. Akinteye Afeez Babatunde in a signed statement said ASUU were pushing forth another agenda that favours them.\n”It is disheartening to witness ASUU, an organization purportedly dedicated to the welfare of students, opposing a program that could provide much-needed relief to countless individuals. This begs the question: does ASUU truly represent the interests of students, or do they have ulterior motives?\n”We are dismayed by ASUU’s hypocrisy in this matter. If ASUU members were to benefit from the Student Loan Program, would they still be opposed to it? It is time for ASUU to come clean and clarify any hidden agenda they may have regarding the student loan. Students demand transparency and honesty from ASUU regarding their stance on this crucial issue,” he said.\nBabatunde also call of the University Union to refrain from acting as the mouthpiece of the Nigerian students\n”Furthermore, ASUU’s attempts to speak on behalf of students regarding the Student Loan Program are unwarranted and unacceptable. Students are perfectly capable of voicing their own opinions and advocating for their interests. ASUU should not presume to speak for students without consulting them directly.” he said.\n”Today, students across the nation are calling on ASUU to refrain from interfering in matters concerning the Student Loan Program. Contrary to ASUU’s assertions, students are not only supportive of the program but are actively advocating for its implementation. The Student Loan Program represents hope for many Nigerian students, especially those facing financial hardship. It offers an opportunity for sons and daughters of ‘nobodies’ to access higher education, thereby levelling the playing field and fostering equal opportunities for all.”\n”In conclusion, students urge ASUU to cease its opposition to the Student Loan Program and to refrain from speaking on behalf of students without their consent. If ASUU has any genuine concerns or reservations about the program, they should address them openly and transparently. It is time for ASUU to prioritize students’ interests and support initiatives that will benefit the entire student community.”","1":"http://www.channelstv.com/home/2013/04/18/orji-commissions-road-to-fast-track-power-project/ce","2":"540","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9998989105"},{"0":"BY EMEKA MAMAH\nIgbo youths Thursday rose from an emergency meeting in Enugu, with a call for full implementation of the agreement signed by Nigerian leaders in Aburi, Ghana in 1967 as the only means of saving the country from disintegration.\nThe youths met to deliberate on incessant killings of southerners and other Christians by Boko Haram in the north. They said Boko Haram and their sponsors were killing Nigerians, simply because a northerner was not the President of Nigeria.\nAccording to the President of the Igbo Youths Movement, IYM, Elliot Ukoh said, “We have decided to demand full implementation of the Aburi accord, whereby Nigerian leaders agreed in principle to establish a confederation in Aburi Ghana in January 1967.\n’’We are demanding for its implementation because the deliberate slaughter of Ndigbo by Boko Haram cannot go on perpetually.\n’’It is unacceptable, we plead for a national conference where Nigerians will come together and decide on confederation. Therefore, on Aburi accord we stand”, Ukoh said.\n‘’The systematic killing of Ndigbo in the North by Boko Haram and their sponsors, simply means that some people do not want Nigeria to remain as one entity; they hope to provoke Ndigbo to retaliate and move the country to a war situation. We believe they are tired of Nigeria.\n’’The Federal Government’s assurances do not match its capacity to stop these killings. That means that the country is only being held together by Ndigbo’s endurance and tolerance in the face of such blatant provocation.\nThat is the point, the killings have continued. Boko Haram targets Ndigbo in the churches; at town hall meetings and even inside buses heading for the south east. The killings are systematic, geared towards attracting reprisals in the hope that a civil war could break out. They want to destroy Nigeria. It is very clear to everyone.\n‘’We will not fight back the Boko Haram way, because it is not in our character to kill in cold blood; innocent northerners in our midst, and also because, we do not want Boko Haram and their sponsors to have their way. Boko Haram will fail in their bid to set the agenda. We will not play into their hands,\n‘’We want to halt the wanton massacre of Ndigbo by Boko Haram. Ndigbo have been killed by our Northern brothers for more than 60 years. They are looking at the only way to seize Igbo properties in the North as abandoned properties; they want a violent confrontation but we agreed not to play into their hands.Their leaders tell us, that they are helpless. That means there is a grand conspiracy to disintegrate Nigeria violently and only a loose federation will save the situation.\nThis present unitary structure has proved unworkable for all to see. The mistake of 1914 (amalgamation of Nigeria) is staring us all in the face. Boko Haram wants to destroy Nigeria because a Southern Christian is president. These killings are aimed at the unity of the country.\n‘’Ndigbo live in Chad, Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger among others and they cope with all their laws. Only a confederation will guarantee peace now. On Aburi we stand. Our Northern brothers want war, we don’t want war, we want a way out. We want the killing of Ndigbo to stop.’’\nHe however, declined comments on the death of Chief Odumegwu Ojukwu, saying, ‘’I do not want to talk about Ojukwu. People tend to use OJukwu’s name to enhance their profile. We are not fighting for political space and I do not want to use Ojukwu’s name. He groomed people to continue the struggle. I do not want to talk about Ojukwu. If you noticed, I retrained from making political capital with his name. I am not a politician.’’\nAsked to access the performance of President Jonathan as it concerned the activities of the Boko Haram Islamic sect, he said, ‘’Jonathan is clearly under attack. The Federal Government is under attack by Boko Haram and their sponsors and Nigerians understand.\n’’We are solidly behind Jonathan. He will only disappoint us when he refuses to fight corruption headlong. Nigeria is under siege. Some people want to destroy Nigeria, because they believe their religion is superior. On Aburi we stand.’’\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"http://www.vanguardngr.com/2012/01/igbo-youths-want-govt-to-implement-aburi-accord/","2":"974","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999866486"},{"0":"By Juliet Umeh\nGoogle for Startups (GfS) Wednesday, announced the 25 African-based startups selected for this year’s $4million Black Founders Fund.\nThe Black Founders Fund, now in its third year, aims to help tackle systemic racial inequality in venture capital (VC) funding by providing equity-free grants and mentoring to early stage Black-led high-growth businesses across Europe and Africa.\nThe selected cohort of 40 startups from Europe and Africa, includes 25 African startups that embody the diverse entrepreneurial spirit across the African continent.

We have now seen his ministers.\nHe deserves the benefit of the doubt. Because when the biblical David set out to rescue Israel, he had gathered some of the most despicable people and reformed them. Amongst his army were rogues, pickpockets and morally bankrupt drunkards. The difference between David and Jagaban, however, is that David didn’t announce himself as a discoverer of talent. He had no access to the cream of society, so he used the dregs. His circumstances were forced on him. We might never know all Jagaban has been through. Another critical difference is that David understood his predicament. He didn’t pretend he had geniuses. That acute self-awareness might have shaped his attitude towards the mission as relied heavily on God.\nPerhaps Jagaban needs no reminding of the qualities of the people he has chosen. He made good picks like Alake, Fagbemi, Adelabu, Edun, etc. But he has a bunch of mediocre folks. Amongst them is a certain loquacious former governor who lacks the capacity for decency and discreetness. The man has publicly professed his love for 40-year-old whiskeys. The public also knows he can’t keep secrets. In his penchant for exhibitionism and a quest for superciliousness, he flaunts 10 million naira-per-bottle whiskeys on garden tables in the govt house.\nJagaban must be informed of these details since he is on a self-imposed damage-limiting exile from social media, the only place where these things matter. Because having asked the poor to make neck-bending sacrifices to save a country in peril, he must advise this minister to drink his luxury wines behind closed doors. But if he must drink in the open on his lawns, then he should contain himself and not flaunt sybaritism into the faces of suffering masses whose degree of wretchedness has convinced the government that N8000 a month to households for six months would be great succour.\nIt’s been said that Jagaban keeps his word. That’s a virtue. In other words, with him, ‘agreement is agreement’. So he is bound to compensate those who helped him win the election and respect the compromises reached, whether ugly or beautiful. But Jagaban need not be reminded that faithfulness must begin with the electoral promises he made to the electorate. Otherwise, it might appear that the masses have been duped by a syndicate. He promised to renew hope. To begin that laudable task, the young men and women who work in our critical institutions must be inspired. Two of our most important institutions are the EFCC and INEC.\nThe EFCC had fingered some governors as crooks. Against these governors, the young men and women in the EFCC had amassed clear documentary evidence, implicating the respected rogues in grand theft and money laundering. If these fellows who have used the courts to thwart legitimate attempts by the young men and women to clean up the polity are allowed to triumph, these patriotic youth will become disillusioned. While Jagaban reserves the right to override the indictments by any agency against any nominee to high office, it might be advisable to tell these lucky individuals not to brandish the impunity awarded to them before TV cameras. So that they do not grate the sensibilities of a bemused public. So that sleeping dogs can lie.\nOften the end justifies the means. So the EU report on the 2023 elections can be dismissed as the ranting of meddlesome interlopers. But from the EU to YIAGA to the United Kingdom, a certain state was implicated by all observers. During the electioneering campaigns in that state, naked violence and official subterfuge were brazenly employed to prevent other party candidates from canvassing for votes. On the 25th of February 2023, electoral malpractices happened in that state on an industrial scale. Of all the states in the country, that state has results on IREV that is so spectacularly different from the results announced by INEC for the presidential elections.\nJagaban knows where all the fingers are pointed. Those in INEC know the state in question. To restore and renew hope in the electoral process, those who exceeded themselves in the perpetration of these sorts of grotesque election malpractices can be rewarded but not with the pulpit. Agreed, we live in a banana republic, but we can’t compensate thugs with the oversight of any of our critical ministries. And if the renewal of hope must take place in INEC, the young men and women who witnessed some of the atrocities in the last election must be sanctified.\nThe best way to begin rehabilitating their minds will be to make them see remorse on the part of the state. But, if the linchpins of the electoral heist are allowed to brag about their rapaciousness, many of these youth will lose faith in the process and the nation. Perhaps Jagaban might have to advise a few of these ministers to resist the temptation of electoral chest-beating especially while kneeling in church at Thanksgiving to mark their appointment as minister.\nBefore Jagaban, Buhari had come to bring Change. Many months after he took the reins, he had no clue whom he wanted to work with. But because his lifestyle inspired hope, folks waited with expectations still. When the list of his ministers was released, village people yawned. Old wines in new plastic bottles. They had seen many of those folks before. But many who had implicit faith in Buhari persevered. Because there was a sprinkling of people of character and zeal in that list. When portfolios were attached to the names, expectations dipped. Because Buhari handed a critical ministry to a particularly inept charlatan. That fellow went on to become the centre of gravity of the administration. He stalled and ruined ideas using unscrupulous emanations as legal advice. With Jagaban we had great expectations on cabinet picks.\nJagaban ought to benefit from Buhari’s errors. Though biblical David harnessed rogues to achieve Godly aims, a rotten egg can send out a stench that would mar a party. The Senate could have helped Jagaban to edit the list dispassionately. But the Senate has been redesigned to serve as a virtual rubber stamp, and the confirmation process has since become a picnic. A certain lady on that ministerial list trained as a medical doctor. She fancies herself as a preventive health expert.\nIn the thick of the COVID epidemic, she had the responsibility to liaise with federal authorities to check the spread of the disease in her jurisdiction. Rather than abide by the oath of her profession and yield to proven medical science, she submitted herself to superstition and egotism. Alongside her often delusional governor, who loves jejune ideas, she declared that there was no covid in her state. But that wasn’t all. She accused the NCDC of attempting to import the virus into her state to sully their clean state. This irresponsible disposition to undermine a federal medical army, which was fighting a viral insurgency, was treasonous. Ludicrous as it was then, a couple of states had believed mangling data and registering no covid case was some great achievement.\nSo they suppressed figures and cooked facts without regard to the consequences on the populace and medical staff. While a belligerent village novice in Kogi could be excused, a preventive health expert who legitimised such a persecutory delusion should have been forced to undergo a mental reassessment. But since biblical David did wonders with all kinds of characters, Jagaban can proceed with the circus clowns in his team. However, it might be necessary to remind him that a covidiot shouldn’t be allowed to go anywhere near the Federal Ministry of Health.\nAll hopes are not lost. By the grace of God, David achieved great things with reprobates. Jagaban needs our prayers.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"http://www.vanguardngr.com/2015/04/tinubu-blasts-party-leaders-over-loss-to-pdp/Jagaban","2":"1678","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9998931885"},{"0":"President Jonathan and former President Obasanjo\n•Says Achebe is living in the past\nFormer President Olusegun Obasanjo has accused President Goodluck Jonathan of mismanaging the security issues engulfing the country.\nObasanjo stated this in an exclusive interview published in the February issue of the pan-African magazine, New African. He blamed Jonathan for the deteriorating situation caused by the insurgent Boko Haram.\n“If the President is the chief security officer of the country and there is a security problem, where do you go for the solution? And if that solution is not coming from the chief security officer, who else inside and outside will get a solution? He has the responsibility to solve the problem, and nobody else should be blamed but him.”\nIn a wide-ranging interview, the former General also challenged claims made by Nigerian literary giant, Chinua Achebe, regarding the country’s civil war in the 1960s. Obasanjo rebuffed claims that successive Nigerian administrations have marginalized the Igbo ethnic group within the country.\n“Maybe he is making those remarks because he is not living in Nigeria. If he was living in Nigeria, when I was the president of this country, an Igbo lady was my Minister of Finance, and Igbo man was the Governor of the Central Bank; an Igbo man was one of the military service chiefs.

As we proceed in the next six months and a span of three years, we are introducing 5000 new buses of European standard to actually clean up the city because if you want to grow the economy of Lagos, transportation is key and then it’s a major infrastructure for tourism itself.”\nGovernor Ambode noted that the dependence on road transportation in the last two decades, as the major means of transportation in the State has give rise to a chaotic system where about eight million Lagosians commute across the State every minute.\n“The question is how do you move 23 million people on a daily basis from point A to point B with ease and comfort? So the way the city has been so designed in the last few years, the city has actually concentrated on only one mode of transportation, which is road transportation. There has not been any comprehensive planning to integrate all the modes of transportation in a way that makes it easy.\n“There are eight million people walking on the streets of Lagos every minute, did we create more points for them. The answer is no. We have one-fifth of the State on water, are we doing effective water transportation, the answer is no. The rail system is still under construction in such a way that it can move mass number of people from one point to another. That is why we have a whole lot of congestion on the road,” the Governor said.\nBesides, Governor Ambode said that State Government had made series of intervention to improve road transportation network through the creation of more bus terminals, lay bys, bus stops to accommodate the eventual take off of the Bus Reform Initiative.\nThe Governor also disclosed that the reforms in the water transportation system was ongoing and would take off fully within the next six to nine months, as a means to encourage residents to utilise it as an alternative means of transportation.\nGovernor Ambode also listed urban migration as one of the major challenges his administration was contending with just as he revealed that about 86 persons enter into Lagos on a daily basis without any plan to go back.\nHe said the attending consequence of such migration was evident on the State’s healthcare system as well as the 13,000 tonnes of waste generated daily in the State on a daily basis, saying that his administration however must continue to think outside the box to provide solutions to such infrastructural challenges.\n“People fly in from Ghana to come and use our hospitals here in Lagos. So we now have to sit down beyond what we have learnt in school to look at the practical challenges of urban migration and good governance and things we have to mitigate against a population that is unaccounted for,” Governor Ambode said.\nThanking the Students for choosing to visit Lagos, he tasked them to go beyond acquiring leadership skills, but also get involved in policy formulation and implementation in their various domains.\nEarlier, immediate past Vice President, International Affairs of Harvard Kennedy School, Mrs. Toyosi Akerele-Ogunsiji said the team was proud of the exploits of the Governor in the last two years, noting that despite the major challenges of urbanisation Lagos was facing, there was appreciable level of progress.\n“I am overwhelmed with joy that I can bring some of the brightest and the best brains in the world to come and see the beauty, the greatness, the resilience, the talent and accomplishment of Nigeria. Lagos is the staple success story of Nigeria. I know Nigeria is not where it ought to be, but I know a State that is sustaining itself by itself under a crucial administration that understands how people should feel, she said.”\nThanking the Governor for receiving the Students, she said that the visit was to explore possible areas of partnership with staff of the State’s Public Service through research fellowships, policy analysis exercises, collaborations on talent, capabilities and constructive criticisms to move the State forward.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"https://www.vanguardngr.com/2017/08/lagos-roll-first-set-5000-new-commercial-buses-six-months/","2":"1089","3":"Politics","4":"2","5":"en","6":"0.9999847412"},{"0":"…says chairman’s actions, utterances deceitful\n…as Atiku, Ayu lead protest March\nJohn Alechenu and Omeiza Ajayi\nThe leadership of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has submitted a strongly worded protest letter to the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC to register its displeasure over the conduct and announced outcome of the Presidential election held on February 25th, 2023.\nNational Chairman of the PDP, Dr. Iyiorchia Ayu who led other party leaders and supporters to the INEC Headquarters, on Monday, submitted the letter which was received by INEC’s Commissioner in charge of Voter Education and Information, Barrister Festus Okoye, on behalf of the INEC chairman, Prof. Mahmoud Yakubu.\nIn the letter which was signed by Ayu and the PDP National Secretary, Samuel Anyanwu, and addressed to the INEC Chairman, the party said it’s decision to embark on a peaceful March backed by the protest letter, was taken after a series of meetings to review the elections.\nThe letter read in part, “…after long sessions of meetings to review and deliberate on the outcome of the Presidential and National Assembly elections held on February 25, 2023 considers it expedient to communicate to you and other critical stakeholders and partners in the advancement of democracy in Nigeria, the position of our great Party (PDP) with regard to the conduct and outcome of that election.\n“It is indeed disheartening to say that the election which raised the hopes of all Nigerians to witness an advancement in our electoral process turned out to be a charade.\n“You would recall the outcry of many concerned citizens of this country variously accusing your commission of complicity in a planned manipulation of the electoral process in favour of the ruling Party (APC).\n“ At each time the issues took the media front burner you were quick in dispelling them as rumors and mere allegations. Today Nigerians have all seen that those allegations were true.\n“In many meetings and briefings your commission held with the Political Parties and the Press ahead of the 2023 general elections, you assured Nigerians that INEC under your leadership would conduct a free, fair, transparent and credible election.\n“You also promised the use of the Bimodal Verification and Accreditation System (BVAS) technology in voter accreditation and result management whereby the public would have unhindered access to the results uploaded to your Servers online and in real time (iREV). Contrary to this belief there was an abysmal failure on your part to honour your promises.\n“Predictably, the conduct and outcome of the Presidential and National Assembly elections fell below acceptable standards. It has resonated the fears of all Nigerians in your integrity and that of your commission to conduct a free, fair, transparent and credible election.\n“The confidence you deceitfully made us to repose in you and your commission has been battered and eroded away by the outcome of that election. The masses are angry and have not hidden their resentment and rejection of the purported declaration you made to that effect.\n“Without any equivocation, this election, in the history of our country elicited so much interest, awareness, commitment and dexterity in Nigerians to exercise their civic responsibility.\n“The major factors that heightened the zeal and confidence of Nigerians to participate in the electoral process were the failures of the ruling APC government, the introduction of the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS) technology ,the Electoral Act 2022 and your repeated assurances of bequeathing Nigerians a credible electoral process.\n“Everyone recalls with disappointment the reported widespread irregularities and manipulations that marred the election. There are ample evidences to show deliberate complicity of your commission in the entire fraud.\n“ The falsification of results and deliberate de-activation of the BVAS and your Servers to frustrate the transmission of election results directly from the Polling Units attest to that. In all these issues brought to your attention you refused to act.\n“Nigerians are no more in doubt of your direct involvement in aiding and abetting the monumental rigging and manipulation of the election results in favour of the ruling Party (APC).\n“In addition, the refusal and neglect of your electoral officers to transmit the results of the election directly from the Polling Units (PU) to INEC Servers as required by law is a flagrant violation of the provisions of the Electoral Act 2022. This action is not acceptable to Nigerians and neither to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). It therefore stands to be challenged.\n“For want of clarity, Section 64 (4) (b) of the Electoral Act 2022 specifically provides thus;\n“A collation officer or Returning\nOfficer at an election shall\ncollate and announce the\nresult of an election subject to\nhis or her verification and\nconfirmation that the –\n(b) “Votes stated on the collated\nresult are correct and\nconsistent with the votes\nor results recorded and\ntransmitted directly from\nPolling Units under Section\n60 (4) of this Act”\n“Consequent upon the above Section 60 (4) of the Electoral Act 2022, the result you have announced and the declarations made are ultra vires, illegal and of no effect except for results transmitted directly from the Polling Units.”\nThe letter further read, “It is therefore circumspect that despite the agitations by Nigerians and our Party during the collation process protesting the reported irregularities surrounding the election you proceeded with the announcement of the results in utter disregard of the provisions of the Electoral Act 2022.\n“It is funny and a gross abuse of our electoral process for your commission to have commenced transmission of the February 25, election results from the various Polling Units (PU) days after the results of the said election had been announced and purported winners declared. Your action in this regard is an affront on the sensibilities of all Nigerians which we have vowed to resist.\n“Notably, the hasty declaration of the election results evidently violating the Electoral Act 2022 places your integrity to total scrutiny going by your deceitful representations and assurances to Nigerians and the International Community that the Electoral Act 2022 is a game changer that would guarantee a free, fair, transparent and credible electoral process especially with the BVAS transmission of election results directly from the Polling Units.\n“The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) detests and condemns this absurdity and brazen rape of our electoral process. Nigeria should be seen as a country governed by the rule of law and it is a responsibility we collectively owe our citizens desirous of entrenching true democratic principles and the rule of law. In this circumstance we call on all Nigerians both home and in the diaspora to stand firmly in defense of their rights, votes and stolen mandate.\n“In consideration of the foregoing, the leadership of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) acting on the mandate of the Nigerian electorate has resolved as follows;\n- To reject and declare as\nunacceptable the outcome,\ndeclaration of the Presidential\nelection results. “ 2. To call on your commission to\nsuspend the on- going\ntransmission of the Polling\nUnits results to your Servers\nwhich is in complete breach\nof the provisions of the\nElectoral Act 2022. - To warn your commission\nagainst a repeat of the\nexperiences of the\nFebruary 25, election in the\ncoming Governorship and\nState Assembly elections of\nMarch 11, 2023. Any attempt\nto manipulate the electoral\nprocess will be vehemently\nresisted. - To call on all Nigerians to be\nco- partners in defense of our\ndemocracy, votes, the rule\nof law and their Rights to freely\nchoose the candidates of their\nchoice. - To demand an explanation why\nyou proceeded with the\ndeclaration of the election\nresults marred with\nirregularities against all\ncalls to address the\ncomplaints brought to\nyour attention before and\nduring the collation process.\n“We are writing to you because we want to bring our grievances and demands formally to your attention for necessary action.\n“Furthermore, to inform you and your commission that, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) together with the ordinary and aggrieved masses of our dear country will no longer tolerate any act in defiance of our electoral processes and laws.\n“We feel pained at the outcome of the February 25, 2023 election and the provocative declaration your commission made against the will of the people. Sadly, this is coming at the time Nigerians were in high hopes of embracing a reformed electoral process.\n“Please take caution in your acts to avoid destabilizing our fledgling democracy.”\nIn his remarks after receiving the protest letter, Okoye said, “So, I have received this protest letter on behalf of the chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission and I promise you this letter will be transmitted to him.\n“If they’re remedial issues we will deal with those remedial issues. But I want to assure you that this Commission is a listening Commission this Commission is a public trust and this Commission belongs to the Nigerian people. Our allegiance is to the people of the federal Republic of Nigeria. This Commission does not owe allegiance to any political party.”\nEarlier, dozens of party supporters dressed in black outfits marched from the PDP Legacy House to the INEC Headquarters amidst singing and dancing with armed regular and riot policemen in several trucks providing security cover.

But in other lands, especially Europe and America, she is a ‘goddess’ whose works are cherished by kings and presidents.\nWithout a doubt, the story of Nike Okundaye, the face behind the huge success story of Nike Arts Gallery, located in Lagos, Abuja and Osogbo, is as compelling as it is inspiring.\nAt a time when young Nigerians are in desperate need of a role model and inspiration in what self-belief and hard work can achieve, Nike’s rise from the status of an unknown village girl born into a seeming insignificant family in a rustic village to a globally celebrated icon would make an A-list inspirational novel.\nBorn in her native village of Ogidi, Ijumu Local Government Area, Kogi State, young Nike had high dreams about what type of future she wanted for herself. But her dreams were truncated even before they could take form when she lost her mother at age six. “I was six when my mother died,” she said with a tinge of sadness.\nWith the blow inflicted on her dreams by her mother’s death, young Nike was taken away to live with her grandmother. At the time, many believed that by going to live with an old woman, the young girl’s future had been compromised. But events have since proved that destiny may indeed have been at work in her journey through life.\nShe had her first contact with the world of arts through her grandmother, who at the time, was the leader of cloth weavers in the community.\nShe said: “I come from a family of craftsmen. My parents were crafts people from Ogidi in Ijumu Local Government Area, Kogi State. My life as an artist is something that I was born with. I started weaving at the age of six.\n“I started with weaving different things, including adire, a traditional Yoruba hand-painted cloth design. As a matter of fact, I can say everything that had to do with textile. They taught me how to weave, using a little calabash. Gradually, I graduated to using bigger materials.”\nThough Nike was six years old and barely able to tell the difference between her left and right hands, she already had a picture of the kind of future she wanted.\n“My grandmother was the head of all the weavers in our community. So, even as a little child, I already had a dream that I would own a big studio when I grew up. People came from different areas to buy the cloth from her. So, at that time, I already sensed that I might not have the opportunity to go to school.”\nWith the death of her mother, her grandmother, whose responsibility it was to look after her, did not pamper her in any form. She ensured that the virtue of hard work was instilled in Nike’s young, impressionable mind.\nAt that time, young Nike, unaware of the reason behind her great grandmother’s action, would cry, believing that she was being unnecessarily punished. “I would cry and lament because I thought she was wicked and punishing me. But today, I always thank her for inculcating in me the virtue of hard work. It was through her that I learnt that you must persevere in whatever you do and never give up on your dreams.”\nAlthough she lost her mother at a time she needed her most, Nike believes that destiny might have been involved in the way her life played out, including her mother’s death. According to her, the mother was a very hard working young woman who would have spared nothing to ensure that her child got a good education up to the university level.\n“Even at that young age, I knew that my mother was very hard working. And I am very sure that if she had not died, she would have trained me up to university level. My father was a farmer. He also did several other things like basket weaving to supplement his income. So, definitely, I would have been educated very well if my mother had not died.\n“But today, I look at my childhood and all that I went through as something designed by destiny. Who knows, maybe if my mother had not died and I had gone ahead to be educated, I may never have had the kind of opportunity that I have today and may never have risen to the level that I am.”\nNike never went to school to study art, the vocation that has brought her to global spotlight. Vocational training in art was passed down to her by her great grandmother, the late Madam Ibikunle. Watching her great grandmother in the art of adire textile processing and helping her out, Nike walked up the line to become an expert in adire making, dyeing, weaving, painting and embroidery.\nA product of the famous Osogbo Art Movement, Nike is today a world acclaimed artist and textile designer. She brings vivid imagination as well as a wealth of history and tradition into the production of adire. Her works are celebrated in major capitals of the world, with her designs exhibited in countries like the USA, Belgium, Germany, Japan and Italy, among others.\nNike spent the early part of her life in Osogbo, a recognised hotbed for art and culture in Nigeria. During her stay in Osogbo, her informal training was dominated by indigo and adire.\nNike’s romance with international exposure began in 1968 when she had an exhibition at the Goethe Institute in Lagos. Since then, she has grown to become a major name on the international art circuit. She is most outstanding in paintings and design of adire, beadwork and batik.\nAmong Nike’s proudest achievements was her invitation to Italy by the Italian government in 2000 to train young Nigerian sex workers on how to use their hands to engage in creative ventures. Her invitation was as a result of complaints to the Italian government by the young Nigerians that they left Nigeria in search of work, not knowing what they would be forced into. When Nike got to Italy, she taught them skills in craft making and many of the women became self-reliant in no time and stopped their old means of income.\nIn 2006, she was awarded one of the highest Italian national awards of merit by the government of the Republic of Italy in appreciation of her efforts in using art to address and solve the problems of Nigerian sex workers in Italy.\nAbout two years ago, her adire painting was accepted at The Smithsonian, the world’s largest museum, located in Washington DC, US. Some of her works can be found amongst the collection of prominent personalities around the world, including the White House.\nWhile little is known about Nike and her works across the country, two former presidents of the USA, Bill Clinton and George Bush, were so enthralled by her works at various times that they sought audience with her during their visits to Nigeria. Much more than just meeting and shaking hands with the two former presidents, it was Nike that decorated George Bush’s room in Abuja during his stay in the country.\nThese two incidents, Nike told The Nation, were some of the best things to have happened to her.\nShe said: “When President Bill Clinton of the US visited Nigeria, he asked to meet the woman behind Nike Gallery, and I was taken to Abuja to meet him. It was the same thing with President George Bush. I was invited to meet him in Abuja during his visit to Nigeria. I was the one that decorated the room where the president stayed during the visit. What honour can be greater than this? I feel accomplished.”\nAs an accomplished artist, Nike has taught in several universities in the US, imparting the knowledge of her traditional adire designs in thousands of eager students from across the world. Her teaching exploits, she disclosed, have taken her to revered institutions like Harvard and Edmonton in Canada.\n“I have lectured and held workshops in several noble institutions across the world. Some of the universities include Harvard, Columbus, Edmonton, Ohio and in Los Angeles, among others. My first experience with teaching was in 1974. At that time, I taught people with doctoral degrees.”\nInterestingly, all the education she had at the time, according to her, was the traditional education that parents pass onto their children.\n“The type of education I had at the time was the education that is passed from parents to their children, not the education you get in a classroom. It was the practical type of education,” she said with a wry smile.\nIn 1983, she established the Nike Centre for Art and Culture in Osogbo, Osun State, where trainings are offered free of charge to Nigerians in various forms of arts. The centre was opened with 20 young girls who were picked from the streets and offered a new life in arts. So far, according to her, more than 3,000 young Nigerians have been trained at the centre.\nThe centre also admits undergraduate students from many universities in Nigeria for their industrial training programmes in textile design. The centre now admits students from Europe, Canada and the United States of America. International scholars and other researchers in traditional African art and culture also visit the centre from time to time for their research works on the processing of adire fabric and African traditional dyeing methods.\nBut she says the true story of the gallery started in her bedroom about 47 years ago.\n“The gallery you see today actually started in my bedroom in 1968. In 2008, we opened the one in Lagos, and my husband was always the motivator. It was intended to give the young and old a platform to hear their voice.”\nAs she spoke, with signs of fulfillment splashed on her face, her husband, Reuben Okundaye, a retired commissioner of police, who had remained quiet since the interview started, suddenly joined in the conversation.\nHe said: “It is with practical education that she has continued to teach and impart knowledge into people with doctoral degrees and masters in Fine Art. Some of these people even come here under the cover of night to seek advice from her. Yet, some would say she is not educated.”\nSpeaking about another experience, Mr. Okundaye said he once had an encounter with a prominent Nigerian who told him that his wife would have been made a minister of the Federal Republic of Nigeria if she was educated. Surprised, he said he took a swipe at the man, telling him his wife was better educated than most of the people that were being flaunted.\nHe said: “You can imagine, I was discussing with one big man the other day and he said that my wife would have been made a minister if she was educated. I was angry and I asked him what he meant by that. Here is a woman who teaches people with doctoral degrees in higher institutions all over the world, yet you say she is not educated. But when the chips are down, they come to her for advice.”\nAsked how she feels whenever she teaches in the classroom, Nike looked up as if relishing her achievements, and said: “I feel fulfilled. It was a very high sense of fulfillment. Imagine, a little girl who grew up in a rustic village without any sign of hope for a good future. Now I stand before PHD holders and teach them. I have been invited to meet presidents of foreign countries. I think I should be proud of my little achievements and be grateful to God.”\nIn spite of her seeming low education, she insists she has no regrets about not attending school. “I have no regrets at all. I give thanks to God for making all these things possible for me. I also thank my husband for standing by me all these years. I must confess that it was not easy coming this far. You will agree with me that for a woman to be recognised, she has to work three times harder than a man.”\nReechoing his wife’s position, Mr. Okundaye said Nike could not have had any regrets, having attained the heights sought by many across the world. “You asked if she has any regrets. How can that be possible? What kind of regret was she supposed to have with all her achievements? She is fulfilled in every sense of the word,” he enthused.\nExpectedly, the couple was attracted to each other by their mutual love for arts. Okundaye told The Nation how it all started: “I have always been an arts lover. I have some of her works. Perhaps, like you said, maybe it was destiny that brought us together.”\nWith a sterling career as a police officer, which saw him attaining the rank of Commissioner of Police and serving in more than four states, the couple has in the last 20 years of their coming together enjoyed the beauty of marriage and weathered the storm together.\nNike, who would be 64 in a couple of weeks, has also successfully created an identity for herself. Her most treasured clothes, she confessed, are adire fabrics. And it is not surprising that she cannot remember the last time she wore anything other than that.\n“You may be right if you say I have created an identity for myself with my adire clothes. It is the only thing that I am known with. I don’t wear any other clothe, even when I travel out of the country,” she said.","1":"http://thenationonlineng.net/new/meet-nigerian-woman-who-has-no-formal-education-but-lectures-at-harvard-other-top-varsities/","2":"2857","3":"Education","4":"2","5":"en","6":"0.999961853"},{"0":"Governor Adams Oshiomhole of Edo State addressing journalists at Iyamho Primary School.\nBenin – Gov.

Oshiomhole should consciously embark on programmes that will reduce poverty in the state, while removing the people of the claws of moneybags who are fond of giving pittance to voters to garner their support.\n“If the citizens are able to reject money or any form inducement for their votes, they will consequently be spiritually and psychologically free to hold elected officials accountable for any form of misrule,” he said.\nOshiomhole had also received similar congratulatory messages from President Goodluck Jonathan and other state governors.

And such inconsistencies have been the fate of history from time immemorial, making Karl Marx to observe that it first repeats itself as a tragedy, and later as farce.\nWhile these observations rightly mirrored the status of past events, whether documented or oral, they nonetheless, didn’t dismiss the instructiveness of history. The latest debate on those who founded Lagos is yet another repetition of history, which gives room to distortion to suit interests and times.\nSuch a situation re-echoes the author of The War of the World: History’s Age of Hatred, Niall Ferguson, who said oral history is a recipe for complete misrepresentation.\nThe American scholar added that when it comes to oral history, almost no one tells the truth, even when they intend. That is a case of the Lagos question, which seems to have birthed many later-day historians, whose conceptions and interpretations contradicted generally accepted narratives on the subject. Since the storyline dates back centuries gone, the witnesses to that history are now history themselves, but there are those who qualified as custodians of that history. One of them is Her Royal Highness, Erelu Kuti IV of Lagos, Erelu Abiola Dosunmu, a direct descendant of the progenitors of Lagos kingship. Her bloodline alone makes her side on the origin of Lagos more authoritative than anyone else. In this interview, which was conducted when the same controversy came up a few years back, Erelu Dosunmu narrated the story of Lagos as handed down by her ancestors. The current debate was provoked by the Oba of Benin, Omo N’ Oba N’ Edo, Uku Akpolokpolo, Ewuare II, who restated what others had said in the past.\nOba Ewuare on a visit to Lagos said: “I cannot help but say that it is in history books that Benin founded Lagos. But when some people hear it now they go haywire that ‘what is the Oba saying?’ But it is true . Go and check the records. Maybe not all of Lagos as we know it now but certain areas in Lagos – maybe the nucleus -was founded by my ancestors. The Oba of Lagos will say so.”\nJust as the monarch anticipated, the remark has reignited the controversy over who founded Lagos.\nAre you not concerned about the controversy over the true aborigines of Lagos?\nI would not say I am concerned because I know the truth. The history of Lagos is not obscure, it is very clear. If people are going to say the truth, we all know what the truth is.\nA friend was saying to me if I was not sure there is no third party trying to take the rights of Lagos through this raging controversy. We all know the story of Lagos from childhood. Even a play was staged about the beginning of Lagos last year. I just know that the truth will surface after this raging controversy because a lot of the gladiators are being miserly in some of their discussions.\nCan you give clarity on some of the things you consider not to be factual among those that have been said so far?\nThe territory of Lagos has always been an extension of the Benin Kingdom in the sense that they used it as a passage to the port for their trading and interaction with foreigners. We all know that foreigners visited the Benin Empire long before colonialism and signing of the treaty of Lagos.\nThis is their passageway and hunting ground. As soon as strangers came to settle down, they would pounce on them and make them pay royalties. Like all human beings, when you settle in a place for a long time, it is expected that you will have the right of ownership. And the foreigners were not ready to be subservient and refused to pay Isakole (royalty) and the Benin king did not take kindly to that. He sent an expedition and subjugated the foreigners and set up his own administration in form of a kingdom.\nTherefore, when I say that we are purely and predominantly Benin, it is the truth. The royalty of Lagos is predominantly Benin. But we have all intermingled and have since inter-married with people from Yoruba land and people from other places. And we are enjoying the two cultures. We are even enjoying more because we now have Igbo, Hausa and other tribes settling in Lagos. We are not enjoying the Yoruba influence alone, we are also enjoying other influences.\nPrior to the institution of the royalty with Oba Ado as the first king, who were the people that the Benin met on the ground?\nThe Benin has always known about Lagos because they considered it as part of their territory and they used it for many purposes. And when the Awori came from Ife to settle in the areas of Lagos, the Benin quickly got them to pay royalties. Benin was landlocked but, as Benin Empire, they were interacting with people from other parts of the world. It was Benin Empire and, when the Portuguese and others came, they also had to pass through the Kuramo waters to get there.\nThey had already laid claim to the land called Lagos. Whether they gave it a name or not, it was an extension of their playground. And when another group of people came to settle there, the Benin said they already had authority over the palace. That was what informed their decision to make the Awori pay royalties. And after paying the Isakole for a while, they (Awori) decided not to pay anymore. That made the Benin to decide not to leave a vacuum anymore and set up an administration.\nThat is why I am saying that there is no ambiguity in the history of Lagos if we are going to tell the truth. All these people, who have been talking, never mentioned that they paid Isakole but we all know that. It is written in books that they paid Isakole. That was the main reason the Benin came and took Olofin away. He refused to be subservient to them. The Benin came here because it is their territory.\nThere is evidence that an expedition was sent from Benin, there is evidence that they were conquered because there was an obaship in place. Even if they did not have anything and just sent an expedition to conquer, when someone conquers, he takes over the land and property of the conquered territory. Now, we want to unify our views and have a consensus so that those people, who are trying to take our rights away, can be confronted to see if we can get some kind of compensation for our children.\nThis is not the first time such controversy is raging, what do you think is responsible for its recurrence?\nWhat I did at NIIA was to state that Oba Dosumu was an unsung hero. It was to state that the treaty for which he was being castigated was a masterstroke. He was a forward-looking king who had the interest of his people at heart. He did not allow his position to go into his head by allowing his subjects to be destroyed in a meaningless battle. He found a way to a roundtable discussion and was able to retain integrity for his kingdom, while still retaining the friendship of the colonial people.\nThere are many countries in Africa where people don’t remember their culture but he found a way to get a concession by which he was allowed to remain a king and sustain the culture and pride of his people as independent human begins. And the people actually enjoyed the benefits because they were able to carry British passports and get scholarships to study abroad. That is why a lot of early educated people were the indigenous people of Lagos. For example, people like the late Justice Elias, Justice Junaidu, and Prince Ajose were among the early educated people. Our fathers and grandfathers were all products of King’s College; they were either great bankers or doctors or pharmacists, etc. It is wrong to think that Lagos people are lazy. It is not the indigenous people of Lagos who are lazy, it is those who come from other places.\nThis kind of controversy happened before and it is here again. In the light of that, how can the issue be resolved because oral history is easily distorted and told to suit individual and group interests?\nIf you don’t talk about issues, solutions may not be found. I think it is appropriate that we should discuss it. There should be this kind of conversation going on but, at the end of the day, a superior argument will carry the day. It is okay to take a story from wherever, but it is right to take it from the beginning and analyse it in a sensible way based on what our ancestors told us, what other people have written and what we learnt from our research. That is the best way instead of the jaundiced way it is being done now. We will get there. It is healthy that conversations will be going on, at the end of the day we will sit at a roundtable and harmonise our views. And whatever that is not clear, we will address it and come up with a consensus. We have had this kind of issue before on the story of the Eyo. The story is so clear but when the conversation started, people were attributing it to a princess from Badagry, but, at the end of the day, it was confirmed that the fetish came from the palace of the father of Queen Olugbani, wife of King Ado of Lagos.\nBut the colourful Aga is a creation of Oba Akisemoye of Lagos, the fetish was to protect them from the curious gaze of the people of Lagos. Strong young men in the neigbourhood were clad in white and given a stick to ward off anybody that wanted to interfere and they were called the Laba. That is why the Laba will always say that they are the head of the Eyo because they were the ones guarding the fetish until the early 1950s when the fetish felt they were not guarded properly by the Laba. Otherwise, Eyo, in the past, instead of the yellow Aga, was always red.\nThey were protecting the fetish but when the fetish felt the Laba was not protecting them anymore, they started having their own people to protect them with different colours of Aga. From there it expanded to the palaces of the white chiefs who started having their groups. It also expanded to groups formed by the Eyo Omo Oloku because, whenever there is an Eyo, it is always to honour departed obas.\nThe Eyo Omo Oloku can also come out in subsequent Eyos. So it kept getting bigger and definitely more colourful but it was a creation of the Oba of Lagos. The fetish was what was brought and the first Eyo was performed at the funeral of Queen Olugbani from where the fetish came from. But before we settled that matter, people told different stories. I believe this one will be resolved. The problem is even not with the indigenous people of Lagos, it is being caused by people who want to claim ownership by default. They are the ones who are actually fueling the controversy.\nThe Benin Kingdom is always a central factor in the history of Lagos and Oba Akiolu even acknowledged the place of the kingdom recently. Are there still some cultural activities that take place between the Lagos royalty and Benin royalty?\nThere is nothing stringent but there are still some courtesies that are exchanged between the two kingdoms. And if a new king is being crowned in Benin, the Oba of Lagos will have a vantage position as a son of the soil within the context of the ceremony. Apart from that, everybody is independent in his own right but we enjoy a lot of goodwill. Whatever is between us now is ceremonial and more of courtesies.\nSince all these started, have you reached out to the dramatis personae?\nI decided to talk because many people have called that, as the person who seems like a custodian of history and culture of Lagos for over 40 years, I should make a statement and reach out to everybody. I am talking because I want us to speak with one voice and not allow other people to take advantage of the situation. I am reaching out and hope that my views will throw more light on the issues. We are going to reach out to more people and iron these out behind closed doors rather than on the pages of newspapers.\nOn oral history…\nWhen people talk about oral history, they also have to think of logic because if people rely on what they hear, they can never have a consensus. But logic must prevail. Time must also prevail because things are time-bound.\nIf, for instance, they are saying that a certain people were paying royalties to the Benin Kingdom and others said they had been there centuries before the Benin came, but the same person who was said to have landed first was the same person that the Benin captured, how many centuries can that be? How long do human beings live? If they are saying the same person who came the first time was captured by the Benin and then returned, how long can it be? A lifetime!

Anya as president of the foundation, and refelect on what should be the role of the Igbo voter in the 2019 election.\nThis is as Chairman of the South-East Governors Forum, Governor Dave Umahi, who was also at the lecture, said the five governors of the South-East are for restructuring of the country and have adopted the Igbo position, which was canvassed at a summit in Awka, two months ago.\nChief Anyaoku, who chaired the lecture titled: ”The Political Economy of Retructuring The Nigerian Federation,” faulted the notion expressed by some people that restructuring Nigeria ”is a veiled campaign to dismember or weaken the Nigerian federation.”\nTo survive, he said Nigeria should copy the kind of federalism practiced by India and Switzerland, which have similar pluralistic ethnic nationalities.\nHis words: ”Since my return to Nigeria in 2000, I have been saying that, informed by my long association with governance in over 50 member countries of the Commonwealth, it is only through restructuring its governance architecture that Nigeria can achieve the national unity with political stability and economic progress that its citizens profoundly desire.\n”Indeed, I do not see how the country can arrest its current drift towards becoming a failed state without restructuring to a true federation of fewer and more viable federating units with greater devolved powers to plan and pursue development and peace in their respective areas.\nEminent personalities at the lecture included Igwe of Oko, Professor Laz Ekwueme; former Chief of Naval Staff, Rear Admiral Allison Madueke, retd; Publisher of Vanguard Newspapers, Mr. Sam Amuka; Elder Uma Eliazu; Governor Dave Umahi of Ebonyi State; Chief Ziggy Azike; Mr Cosmas Maduka; Mrs Stella Okoye and Mrs Kate Onyechere among others.\nDelivering his 12-page lecture, Professor Soludo outlined a litany of reasons Nigeria must be restructured urgenty.\nThe reasons include: Nigeria’s constitution, which he said is an inappropriate Meta institution for a productive economy, institutional dysfunction and circular stagnation, unviable states and inability of 30 of the 36 states to pay salaries without federal allocation, over-dependence on oil revenue, and disincentive for economic diversification among others.\nNigeria suffering from oil structure disease\nHe said the overarching case for restructuring is economic. ”Restructuring should provide the necessary foundational meta-level socio-political-governance architecture for the emergence and sustainability of a secured and prosperous post-oil economy…\n”Nigeria’s meta institution, its Constitution (legal-political-governance architecture) is designed to share and consume the oil rents and has perverse incentives for a productive economy. Oil or natural resource boom is known to cause the appreciation of the real effective exchange rate thus harming the economy, and this has been reffered to as the Dutch Disease syndrome.\nOurs is beyond the Dutch Disease. We also suffer what can be described as a Lottery Effect – a syndrome whereby a hitherto hardworking person wins a lottery, quits his job and restructures his family’s lifestyle around the consumption of the lottery money; breeds more children and each with guaranteed allowance from the lottery money; and centralises decision-making in the family such that the children never have the experience to take up challenges and mature in the process; etc.\nAt adulthood, the children have developed a dependent/entitlement mind-set and the ageing dad can no longer cope while the lottery money can no longer service the bloated livestyle. Instead of the lottery windfall aiding the family, the arrangements designed to utilise it might turn the Lottery into a curse.\n”The above is a caricature of Nigeria’s experience with oil and the institutional arrangements to share and consume it. A combination of the Dutch Disease syndrome and Lottery Effect produced what I refer to as Nigeria’s Oil Structure Disease.\nUntil we wean the system of this Disease, Nigeria’s economy will continue to sluggishly muddle along. This structural disease is the key reason Nigeria’s quest for economic diversification over the decades has been moving in fits and starts.”\nThe way out\nTo solve the problem, Soludo said there are three types of restructuring: soft restructuring (amendment of the constitution to allow state police, scrapping of local councils and resource control, etc) as recommended by the All Progressives Congress, APC, Restructuring Committee; and Hybrid restructuring (negotiation of a new constitution with regional auttonomy within the federation); and hard restructuring (confederation or outright independence for any desiring part of the country.)\nHe identified hybrid restructuring as the best for the country and urged political leaders, who he said have developed inertia to act, to carry it out. He also observed that those benefitting from the current structure do not want restructuring.\nNoting that restructuring will have short to medium winners and losers, he added that everyone could potentially win in the long run.\nOil money revenue squandered on bureaucracy\nHe argued: ”For a constitution that proclaims a federal structure, the exclusive and concurrent lists constitute an atypical concentration of powers at the centre. Currently, the federal government is burdened with hundreds of parastatals and agencies trying to inefficiently micro manage the entire Nigeria, with recurrent expenditure of the federal government exceeding total federal revenue.\nEvery penny of capital spending by the Federal Government of Nigeria is borrowed, and its fiscal position is precarious. Put starkly, not one kobo of oil money is invested in infrastructure by the FGN; it is all consumed by the obtuse federal bureaucracy. Unless we assume that oil boom will rebound and endure, devolution is a matter of survival for the FGN and the national economy.”\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"https://www.vanguardngr.com/2018/08/2019-poll-a-referendum-on-restructuring-soludo/","2":"1458","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9997882843"},{"0":"Chief Bode George, Mr. Aderemi Olusegun.

The arrested suspects provided useful information which led to the arrest of the alleged mastermind of the Christmas Eve bombings in Jos”.\nAttempts to get the name of the suspect proved abortive as the sources maintained that investigations were still on-going.\nSunday Vanguard was nonetheless told that “the suspect is already providing useful information that would assist in the investigations of some other dastardly acts”.\nOnce the investigations are completed, the security sources stated, “the bombing mastermind would be arraigned along with his collaborators in the aw court”.\n32 people were confirmed dead and 74 hospitalized in the blasts which rocked two parts of Jos, last Christmas Eve.\nGiving details of the bombings, Plateau State commissioner of police, Mr. Abdulrahman Akano, said a total of seven explosives were planted in the two parts of the state capital.\nAccording to him, five of the explosives went off at the Kabong area while two were detonated at the Angwan Rukuba area. One of the bombs was planted in a busy market at Kabong where people were making last-minute purchases for Christmas while another was planted at a relaxation spot in Angwan Rukuba.\nHe said dynamites and about 100 match boxes were recovered from one of the places combed by men of the bomb unit of the police and were being analyzed.\nAkano described the incident as more political than religious or ethnic, saying, “Honestly, my own estimation of this is that it is political.

But the couple, now 107 and 95 years respectively, have found a new sparkle to rekindle their marital love in the church.\nThe church ceremony in Plateau State, has remained the talk of the town in the social diary of the state and may remain so for a long time. This is particularly so because the celebrants are the first couple in the history of the state to be administered marital vow at such unusual ages.\nAt 95, the bride is well past her menopause. Her surviving first child is 65 years old. The groom, popularly known to many in his neighbourhood as Baba Dikam, is 107 years old and may no longer be sexually active. But all that is not enough to discourage the couple from walking down the aisle arm-in-arm for a new marital oath.\nThe ceremony, which was held at the Church of Christ in Nations (COCIN), Chizu village in Bwai, Mangu Local Government Area of the state, was a delight to watch as it was packaged in the manner that young grooms and brides would walk down the aisle. The groom was dressed in black suite and a red neck tie to match, while the bride stepped out dressed in a pure white wedding gown with a neatly made hair to match. They drove to the church in separate vehicles, as if they never met before. The groom was accompanied by cutely dressed men and the bride by a long bridal train.\nThey had a procession and matched into the church separately as if they never met before. They only came together after they were wedded by the officiating pastor. The officiating pastor of the church, Rev. Tongwe Sale, congratulated the couple and admonished them as if they were young couples. He said: “Marriage is ordained by God and it should be kept sacred.” He charged them to keep faith in God since they are still alive, noting that although they are old, they can still be important in the lives of their children and grand children.\nTaking his message from Genesis 1:26-27, Rev. Elisha Pam spoke on the topic, “Marriage: Highly mysterious” and pointed out that when God created Adam, the woman was already in existence in the body of man, after which she was brought out in a mysterious way and Adam named her Eve. He noted that the grounds for a solid marriage are patience and obedience through Christ as he read Ephesians 5:21\nThey happily took the oath that they would love themselves until death do them apart. They also vowed not to allow a third party in their marital life. They signed the marriage certificate after the service and marched out of the church dancing to the admiration of their guests.\nWhen they got outside the church auditorium, the newly wedded couple posed for photograph in various styles and angles. After the photograph session, they moved in a car and zoomed off to the reception ground accompanied by their guests, children, friends and family members.\nWhen it was time to cut the wedding cake, the couple walked hand in hand to where the colourful cake was placed. The groom continuously gazed at his wedding ring in a manner that suggests that the occasion was a dream come true for him. Like marksmen, they held the knife firmly and on completion of the spelling of Jesus, they cut the cake and feebly smiled at the guests. They trilled their guests with the ceremonial culture of couple feeding one another with the cake and non-alcoholic wine. After feeding themselves, the newly wedded couple danced to the music blasting from the loud speakers in “old school” style to the admiration of their guests.\nIt was celebration galore at the reception for the family and friends of the couple. The couples told their excited guests at the reception their true life stories. They said it was the grace of God that allowed them to solemnise their marriage in the church.\nThe groom narrated his life story thus: “I had seven wives and 32 children during my younger days, but I did so because I did not know Christ. But that made me great among my contemporaries as only those who were wealthy could do that. But in spite of that, God remained faithful and merciful for me. I have a lot of testimonies to show that God was so faithful to me. I am now in a better position to advise my children and my well wishers to live the life of Christ. I don’t want any of my children to emulate my past life style, because you may fall out of the grace and mercies of God. But I’m so pleased because my children are committed to Christ; they lived the life of Christ, they were the ones that insisted I must come to Christ and take their mother to the altar.\n“Before now we lived our lives outside Christ, but from today, we are now confirmed children of Christ. It would have been worse for us if we had died without Christ. But God has protected our lives up till this moment to come to Him.”\nOne of the children of the couple, Barr. Zephaniah Garba was full of appreciation and praises to God when he spoke with our reporter. He said: “I am full of joy today because my father has come to profess Christ at his old age. I have been looking forward to this day and I thank God they were able to make it. I want to encourage those who did not conduct their marriage in Christian way to try and do so; it is never late. My father’s own should be an example to others, you can still do it”.\nThere were goodwill messages from the Chairmen of PCC Kabwir, Rev. David Musa, and Langtang North LG Chairman elect, Hon. Daniel Dandul, while various dance groups added colour to the event as the couples cut their wedding cake.","1":"http://thenationonlineng.net/new/drama-as-107-yr-old-man-takes-heartthrob-95-to-altar/","2":"1264","3":"Romance","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999961853"},{"0":"The Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee of All Progressives Congress (APC) has announced the postponement of the nationwide membership registration update and revalidation exercise schedule to commence on Saturday, December 12.\nAccording to the Secretary of the Caretaker Committee, John Akpanudoedehe who disclosed this, membership registration has been postponed to the second week of January 2021 taking into consideration the Christmas season and to ensure maximum participation by all party.\n“As you are all aware, the membership registration, update, and revalidation exercise of our great party was supposed to commence on Saturday, December 12, 2020.\n\"On account of several factors, however, including the fast-approaching Christmas and End of Year celebrations; as well as the interest of our Christian members; and the objective of ensuring maximum participation, the CECPC has decided to shift the date of the exercise to the second week of January 2021.\n“The CECPC sincerely regrets any inconveniences that may arise out of the change in date; but appeals for the understanding of our teeming members and the general public, in the interest of preparing a solid foundation for a successful Exercise.\n\"The party wishes you all; as well as members of the public, a peaceful and rewarding Yuletide, and End of Year celebration.”\nAllNews recalls that on Wednesday, the APC dissolved all its party structures nationwide after its National Executive Committee meeting in Abuja.","1":"https://allnews.ng/news/apc-postpones-nationwide-membership-registration-till-next-year","2":"298","3":"Politics","4":"0","5":"en","6":"0.9999027252"},{"0":"Presidential Candidate of the Peoples Democrtic Party, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar acknowledging cheers from hin teeming supporters as he was warmly received from the trip to the United States of America at the General Aviation Terminal, Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja.

This report finds the illicit drug trade to be worth roughly $320 billion and counterfeiting $250 billion. These numbers reflect the potential for huge profits which is the fundamental driver of criminal trade,” it said.\n“These criminal flows can do immeasurable structural damage to developing economies by empowering forces which erode the capacity of the state,” it added.\nTI said that while most counterfeit goods are produced in China, production can also be found in the Philippines, Taiwan, Vietnam, Malaysia, India, Russia and other former Soviet republics, as well as countries in Latin America and Africa.\nCounterfeit goods are then shipped, often through free trade zones like Dubai, to their final destinations in the United States, the European Union, or where there is demand.\nShipping through free trade zones allows the origins of the goods to be disguised, and also provides a chance for “unbranded products to be decorated with the appropriate logos close to the destination market,” noted TI.\n“Once the goods get through customs at their destination they are shipped to a warehouse for ‘storing, repackaging and distribution.’ This provides another opportunity for labels to be put on anything that has not yet been branded,” it added.\nTI toted that an Interpol report estimates global commercial losses due to counterfeiting at $500 billion, while another, published by OECD in 2009, suggests that the annual value of internationally traded counterfeit and pirated goods could be around $250 billion.\nFor organ sale, the Philippines is among the “common donors” of these organs together with China, India, Turkey, Egypt, Moldova, Romania, Brazil, Bolivia, and Peru for buyers coming from developed countries like the United States, Canada, Japan, Italy, and Australia, as well as the wealthy classes from developing countries such as Saudi Arabia, Israel, and Oman.\nKidney is the most commonly transplanted organ, with a global estimate of 68,500 transplants performed per year, followed by the liver (20,100), heart (5,200), lung (3,250), and pancreas (2,800).\nIllicit trade in kidney and liver alone is estimated to reach between $600 million and $1.2 billion per year.\n“As with other forms of trafficking, the illegal kidney trade generally ‘flows from poor, underdeveloped countries to rich, developed ones’… Recently China, Pakistan, and the Philippines have taken steps to prohibit ‘transplant tourism,’ which the United Network for Organ Sharing defines as ‘the purchase of a transplant organ abroad that includes access to an organ while bypassing laws, rules, or processes of any or all countries involved.’ These efforts have dramatically slowed the practice of open transplant tourism, but experts believe that the practice continues as ‘an underground criminal activity,’” TI said.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"http://www.vanguardngr.com/2011/02/nigeria","2":"1209","3":"Politics","4":"2","5":"en","6":"0.9997130036"},{"0":"Stella Oduah, Aviation Minister\nBy Kenneth Ehigiator\nAn average watcher of recent developments in the aviation sector in the country may be tempted to say Nigeria has never had it so good in terms of paying attention to upgrade in infrastructure and key navigational facilities at the nation’s airports since most of them were built decades ago.\nFor instance, the nation’s flagship, the Murtala Muhammed Airport was commissioned in 1979 and ever since, no efforts had been made to renew it until the recent re-modelling embarked upon by the present administration. However, the re-modelling of physical infrastructure of airports is where the transformation of the industry stops as policy flip-flops still trail developments in the sector.\nEven the re-modelling appears not holistic, what with the cooling system of Lagos airport which performance remains epileptic as the chillers are as old as the airport itself. Talks of replacing them had been mere lipservice, even by the present dispensation.\nWhat is the essence of exotic physical structures without comfort for the travelling public. The functionality of an airport goes beyond beautiful terminal buildings as exemplified by LeopoldSedarSenghor Airport in Dakar, Senegal, for instance.\nThat airport is not presentable in terms of physical beauty but is functional 24 hours of the day without power failures, stuffy terminal building and epileptic navigational aids. Where Nigeria is struggling to position the MurtalaMuhammedAirport as a hub in West Africa without success, the airport in Dakar remains a natural hub due to its functionality.\nThe stowaway incident at Benin airport weeks ago is symptomatic of the rot still prevalent in the aviation sector, in spite of the semblance of transformation in the industry. Without necessarily instilling fears in the public, there may yet be more incidents of stowaway at the nation’s airports.\nThis is because aside from the airport in Benin, several others in the country, including the international airports, lack airport fencing, let alone perimeter fencing as prescribed by global aviation regulator, the International Civil Aviation Organisation, ICAO.\nWhen a herd of cattle strayed onto the runway of Port HarcourtInternationalAirport about a decade ago, the promise was that within that period, all airports in the country would be equipped with perimeter fencing. Because nothing was done, a cab rammed into an Arik airliner ready for taxiing at MargaretEkpoInternationalAirport in Calabar, which an airport fencing could have averted.\n“ All we have at some of our airports at present are airport fencing, no security fencing to satisfy Annex 17 of ICAO. I think government ought to have done this a long time ago. It is unfortunate that nothing had been done about this currently,” said Capt. Dele Ore, a stakeholder.\nAlthough these lapses were present when Nigeria got U.S. Federal Aviation Administration, FAA, category 1 certification on August 23, 2010, the expectation was that all issues relating to airport safety and security would be addressed shortly after.\nHowever, things seem to be degenerating further, four years after. At the moment, no Nigeria airport is certified by the regulatory agency, not even the international airports. The fear is Nigeria may lose the certification unless practical steps are taken to redress the present situation.\nThe infractions that made Mexico lose its certification a few years ago are not as serious as the stowaway incident at Benin airport, which gave the impression that the nation’s airports unsafe for passengers and investments\n.Another stakeholder, Capt Tito Omaghomi, is only concerned about the embarrassment the country had been subjected by the stowaway story, wondering why airports in Nigeria had been left with perimeter fencing, almost four years after the country secured FAA Cat1 certification.\n“This incident has offered opportunity to award contracts now; we don’t do the right thing at the right time but wait for things to degenerate before we start scrambling to award contracts,” he lamented.\nBeyond just creating the opportunity for Nigerian airlines to operate direct flights into U.S. destinations, the certification also serves as a blank cheque for local airlines to source for necessary foreign capital to upgrade their operations but because government is not interested in the development and growth of local airlines, this aspect of FAA category 1 certification does not appeal to those in government. Otherwise, how else does one describe recent hoopla that greeted Ethiopian Airlines’, ET, foray into AkanuIbiamInternationalAirport, Enugu, two weeks ago.\nIt should be noted that any government serious about the development of its aviation sector would not celebrates multiple entries for foreign airlines into its territories as doing that sets the tone for death of local airlines. And for an aviation sector that is as fledgling as Nigeria’s, the multiple entries granted foreign airlines by officials of the Aviation Ministry can best be described as debilitating for a struggling economy.\nThe implication of this is capital flight which, before now, had been put at close to N100 billion annually. So, the wild celebration that greeted ET flight into Enugu demonstrated the lack of capacity on the part of those drawing up policies for the aviation industry.\nEnugu now makes Ethiopian Airlines’ third entry point into the country, after Lagos and Abuja. Other foreign airlines enjoy same approvals from the Aviation Ministry. This makes the aviation industry the worst bleeding spot for the country in terms of capital flight.\nIdeally, local airlines are positioned to feed passengers for foreign airlines but now that the international airlines are indirectly carrying passengers to virtually every corner of the country, government’s talk about assisting domestic airlines to grow amounts to policy somersault. No sane country does it.\nThe entry of Ethiopian Airlines into Enugu is a negative development for domestic airlines. All we have done is to give way to kill the domestic carriers; we are killing the industry gradually.\nThey have also succeeded in killing operations into Port Harcourt, Owerri and Asaba, as the domestic airlines are supposed to feed passengers for foreign airlines to these airports. Politically, we have scored some good points but on the other hand, we are damaging the economy,” said Capt. Dele Ore, an ex-pilot.\nIn the past one year, there had been so much agitation by stakeholders against infiltration of the sector by non-aviators, people with little or no knowledge about aviation. Although the practice did not start today, close watchers of the industry expected that for a government that expressed so much passion about changing things for good, it would have been a thing of the past.\nBecause aviation is a technical sector which revolves around human lives, critical sections of the industry should be driven by people with sound knowledge of aviation matters. Unfortunately, political considerations had been the main criteria in employing and deploying personnel in the sector. In the past, a minister had flooded the regulatory agency with recruits from village of origin, qualified or not, and this accounted for the rot that culminated in series of crashes in the industry. However, when another minister came in, who also recruited his kinsmen into critical sections of the sector, they were all swept away.\nThe tragedy of the whole thing is that the practice is still prevalent. Aviation is too sensitive to be placed at the altar of ethnicity, nepotism and jingoism. What the practice had engendered in the sector is low moral of personnel as those imposed from outside the industry are often placed in management positions to boss others around.\nAviation regulation is one area stakeholders and observers of the industry expected the present administration to build on the foundation laid by President Olusegun Obasanjo’s government. Suffice to say that prior to December 2005, aviation regulation was non-existent as airline operators and other critical players in the industry carried with business as usual.\nThe Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority, NCAA, at the time had no autonomy to properly regulate the industry and had every of its programmes, from staff recruitment to airlines’ regulation, dictated by officials of the Aviation Ministry whose interest were self-serving. Consequently, their action and inaction led to the series of aviation accidents recorded between 2005 and 2006. It was the same ministry officials who in 2003 enslaved the sector to the U.S. and its allies through the Open Skies Agreement, which resolutions were completely skewed against Nigeria’s interest.\nThat tactless move is partly responsible for dominance of the industry by foreign airlines at present. However, with the close collaboration of the Presidency and National Assembly, the country came up with the new Civil Act 2006 which granted the NCAA autonomy, even though the Aviation Ministry still reared its head occasionally.\nThat brought some sanity into the sector and culminated in the U.S. FAA category 1 certification the country attained in 2010. Can NCAA still be said to be autonomous now? Certainly not, what with the new aviation policy the Aviation Ministry churned out earlier this year. There again lies another threat to FAA Cat1.\nObservers contend that the Ministry of Aviation should put into enthronement and sustenance of aviation safety and security the same level of zeal deployed into airports’ re-modelling.\nThis contention is hinged on the fact that the NCAA had had problems of inadequate inspectors which the immediate past director-general, Dr. Harold Demuren, had always admitted to have worked against the agency’s capacity to adequately effect safety and economic audit of airlines operating in the country.\nWhile re-modelling of airports could be said to be desirable, there are much more deeper issues to be addressed in the sector, if it must play the role of driving the economy as it does in other countries of the world. What appears germane to drive growth in the sector and larger economy of the country are policies that are investment-friendly, that could place domestic airlines on the plain not only to compete but also contribute effectively to development of the economy.\nThe airlines, as they are, cannot grow and create jobs because of the inconsistencies in policies churned out by government. What should bother this government, in the main, is how to address issues of multiple charges, navigational and non-navigational, skyrocketting fuel prices and high interest rates. These are leverages foreign airlines enjoy from their host governments to make them competitive.\nFloating another carrier without resolving these issues would result in the scenario that saw the end of Virgin Nigeria, after only four years of operations. It should be noted that the industry cannot grow without commensurate growth of local airlines; foreign airlines cannot grow the country’s economy, they only help to bleed it through capital flight.\nPerhaps those in the Ministry of Aviation need some training to be tutored on the mechanics of using aviation as economic driver rather than a vehicle for just moving people from points A to B. Nigeria’s aviation has no reason not to grow, what with a population of about 170 million, which is the requisite incentive for foreign airlines who fall over themselves to do business here.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"http://www.vanguardngr.com/2013/10/aviation-development-a-rehash-of-old-tunes-2/","2":"2284","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999866486"},{"0":"Senators worried over COVID-19 status of 35 colleagues\nBy Yusuf Alli, Managing Editor, Abuja\nFear heightened on Monday over the fate of about 35 senators who have not complied with the measures to determine their Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) status.\nThe senators last week returned from a trip to the United Kingdom (UK), where they attended a Petroleum Industry Governance Bill (PIGB) seminar in London.\nIt was learnt that they were caught in the web of coronavirus outbreak in the UK at a time the Federal Government directed that those returning from any of the COVID-19 high-risk countries should self-isolate for 14 days.\nIt was gathered that other senators are pressuring Senate President Ahmad Lawan to prevail on their colleagues to excuse themselves from the chamber’s business.\nSome of them (senators) were also said to be pushing for COVID-19 test for their colleagues.\nThe senators are members of the Senate Committees on Upstream, Downstream and Gas.\nTwo female senators are among those on the trip.\nIt was learnt that since the senators returned on March 14, they had been coming to the chamber to participate in legislative activities.\nA source, who spoke in confidence, said: “When the senators returned to the country, the President of the Senate tactically told them to go into self-isolation for 14 days. But most of them ignored his advice.\n“In fact, the senate president refused to either hug or shake hands with them to the consternation of the affected senators.\n“Now, we have a big challenge in the Senate. Some of us are pushing that these Senators should rescue themselves from all the activities in the chamber.”\nAlthough a senator confirmed some of his colleagues had just returned from the UK, he was quick to add: “Some of them have actually gone for test to confirm their status.\n“When we meet on Tuesday, we will be able to ascertain their real status and the next steps the chamber should take to protect the hallowed chamber.”\nThere were indications that the executive was worried about non-compliance of the Senators with the guidelines on the management of COVID-19.\nA source in government said: “There are no records that some of them went into self-isolation or test.\n“I think the government has sent the necessary advisory to the leadership of National Assembly on the need for the senators to respect the rules and regulations on COVID-19.”\nWhen contacted, Information and Culture Minister Lai Mohammed said: “I’m not aware that some senators travelled abroad and that rather than go into self-isolation, went into hiding.\n“But I know that the leadership of the National Assembly has directed that all its members that have just come in from any of those countries should self- isolate for 14 days.\n“Our appeal is that such members will heed the directive.”","1":"https://thenationonlineng.net/senators-worried-over-covid-19-status-of-35-colleagues/","2":"622","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9996500611"},{"0":"NNPCL expands global market footprint to Japan, China with LNG\nNigerian National Petroleum Company Limited (NNPC Ltd) has commenced shipment of Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) cargoes to Japan and China on a Delivered Ex-Ship (DES) basis.\nIt is in line with its strategic vision to be a dynamic and reliable global energy supplier of choice.\nNNPCL Chief Corporate Communications Officer, Mr. Olufemi Soneye, disclosed this in a press statement on Monday, August 26.\nThe statement said NNPC Ltd achieved the milestone through the collaboration of two of its downstream subsidiaries – NNPC LNG Ltd and NNPC Shipping Ltd – which delivered its first DES LNG cargo from the 174,000m³ LNG vessel Grazyna Gesicka at Futtsu, Japan, on 27th June 2024.\nNNPCL said since then, it has expanded its footprint to China with the delivery of one LNG cargo on a DES basis.\nThe state-owned company explained that delivered Ex-Ship (DES) is an international commercial term that requires the seller to deliver the products/goods at a specific port. The seller takes responsibility for the shipping and insurance for the products/goods until they get to the specified port of delivery. It requires expertise and a higher level of efficiency to execute than the Free on-Board (FOB) system.\nRead Also: 10 reasons why you should get enough sleep\nNNPC Ltd has been involved in LNG trading since 2021 with its first LNG cargo sale in November of that year.

Consequently, this is an open invitation by the APC to corrupt persons to join them as a party that accommodates, protects and promotes corruption in the country.\n“Our joy remains that the people of Kogi and Bayelsa will definitely reject this attempt to use immunity to cloak and protect friends and associates of the ruling party and government from further prosecution.\n“It is on this note that we urge the people of the two PDP states to remain unrelenting in their support for our great party and its candidates; Governors Idris Wada and Seriake Dickson respectively, to ensure their deserving overwhelming victory at the polls,” the PDP said.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"http://www.vanguardngr.com/2015/10/gov-election-audu-sylva-mockery-of-apc-anti-corruption-stance-pdp/","2":"863","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999694824"},{"0":"Militant groups threaten to resume armed agitation over 13% derivation\nBy Simon Utebor, Yenagoa\nA coalition of nine militant groups in the Niger Delta has threatened to dump the ceasefire reached with the Federal Government and resume armed agitation over the alleged refusal of the government to stop paying 13 per cent derivation to the governors of the region.\nThe coalition, under the aegis of Reformed Niger Delta Avengers (RNDA), accused Governors of the region of allegedly diverting the money accruing from the 13 per cent derivation to personal pockets without recourse to the infrastructural development of the oil-producing communities.\nThe RNDA, in an electronic statement on Friday by its Coordinator, self-styled ‘Major General’ Johnmark Ezonebi, urged President Muhammadu Buhari to pay the derivation directly to oil producing communities since the governors had allegedly failed the people of the region.\nThe coalition lamented despite the series of complaints and petitions against the state governors concerning the underdevelopment of the Niger Delta, the Federal Government had not deemed it necessary to stop paying the derivation to them.\nThe RNDA threatened the alleged decision by Buhari to side with the state governors by refusing to the stop the derivation payment to them would not be tolerated any longer and it might lead to resumption of hostilities in the region.\nThe coalition said: “We frown at the payment of 13 per cent derivation funds to state governors in the Niger Delta despite protests and suggestions that it be paid to the oil-producing communities in the region in order to improve the direct welfare and infrastructural needs of the oil communities.\n“We agreed after our emergency meeting in the creeks of the Niger Delta that we will soon collapse the cease-fire agreement entered with the Federal Government since on the 21st of August 2016, if the payment of 13 per cent derivation fund to the governors continues.\n“And that it will be bloody in the creeks if our demands are not met because we will not fold our arms and continue to tolerate the deliberate perpetual injury occasioned by the governors of the oil-producing states to the people who are from the oil-producing communities in the creeks.\n“There is serious deliberate neglect by the governors of the region despite receiving such huge amount of money monthly while the people in the communities are abandoned and left to suffer.\n“The Governors live flamboyantly without having any human feelings for their fellow kinsmen who suffer most hazards from the exploitation and exploration activities from crude oil production from the communities.\n“Our people are left with no single meaningful development and human empowerment despite the billions and trillions of naira being collected by these Governors on behalf of the oil-producing communities.\n“The level of deliberate abandonment and neglect by the governors of the South south states who are receiving over N180 billion yearly from the Federation Account as payment of 13 per cent derivation from the Federal Government on behalf of the oil producing communities is nothing to write home about.”","1":"https://thenationonlineng.net/militant-groups-threaten-to-resume-armed-agitation-over-13-derivation/","2":"630","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.999961853"},{"0":"As he has always done, Nwannekaenyi \"Nnamdi\" Kanu, a Nigerian Biafra political activist, and leader of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), a group canvassing for the secession and sovereignty of Eastern Nigeria on Monday hit out at his country of birth, AllNews reports.\nSelf-exiled Kanu via his known Facebook page wonders why Nigeria would 'build expensive refineries; export crude oil, but import diesel, kerosine, and petrol at twice the amount they sold the crude oil'.\nThese are the some of the headlines that makes you wonder what sort of demon created the Zoo Nigga-area and the animals Niggerians that inhabit.

For some years now, we have piled graduates upon graduates mortgaging the nation’s future and our children’s future for the greed, avarice and planlessness of our leaders through bad governance.\nThe enormity of unemployment challenge which has become a colossal one – a socio-economic affliction of great proportions can be illustrated most vividly when out of the 13,000 applications received by the Dangote Group of Companies for Graduate Executive Truck Drivers, there were six Ph.D, 704 Masters and over 8,460 Bachelor degree holders.\nMost astonishing was the fact that the company only needed 100 drivers but got 13,000 applications, most of them from reputable universities.\nAccording to the Federal Ministry of Labour and Productivity, more than 41% of Nigerian graduates are without employment after the mandatory National Youth Service Corps engagement.\nThe National Bureau of Statistics said over 50% of youths in Nigeria are jobless, while the World Bank puts the figure at 56%. Considering the country’s estimated population of about 167 million and 60 million jobless, these are grim figures portending danger to economic growth and development of a nation with the largest concentration of black people on earth.\nPerhaps worried that the youths are at the receiving end of this unemployment scourge, President Goodluck Jonathan’s administration came up with an initiative of youth entrepreneurship in partnership with the Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Communication and Technology, Ministry of Youth development and the Ministry of Women Affairs and Social Development called “The Youth Enterprise with Innovation in Nigeria (YOUWIN)”.\nThis will help to generate jobs by encouraging and supporting ambitious and creative enterprising young men and women to develop and implement business ideas for job creation. It is envisaged that over a 3-year period in which the second cycle will be completed in 2013 (September) between 80,000 to 320,000 new jobs will be created at cost of N10 billion.\nIn addition, the Federal Government said it has given over 1,000 youths who distinguished themselves after screening and training offered them in various vocations a take-off grant of about N1 billion to actualise their aspirations.\nThere is also Women and Youths Employment project carried out under the subsidy Reinvestment and Empowerment programme targeting employment for over 300,000 unskilled youths, women and the disabled each year.\nSome experts doubt the sustainability of these initiatives and whether they can be permanent bearing in mind the failure of the Youth Empowerment Scheme (YES) and the Micro Finance Bank initiative launched in 2005.\nInvariably, all these are mere palliatives, only trying to scratch the surface of the unemployment problem.\nGovernment can arrange special stimulus packages to several companies and conglomerates operating in Nigeria from oil to telecom, construction and manufacturing to expand and provide employment to qualified youths. Government should engage in specific projects with the objective of creating jobs.\nAreas begging for massive investment include infrastructure like roads, electricity, housing, agriculture, railways, environmental sanitation, bridges, water and refineries. Others are education, health, petrochemicals, mining, excavation, as all these projects have potential to create millions of jobs.\nAn American scholar puts it succinctly in this way: ”One of the unwritten and unspoken commonplaces lying at the root of modern academic policy is that the various universities are competitors for the traffic of merchantable instruction in much the same fashion as rival establishments in the retail trade compete for customers.”\nThe school system comprising primary, secondary and tertiary is not providing patriotic, productive, self-actualising, creative thinking individuals, while at the same time, the various regulatory agencies have failed to set standards and to ensure compliance at all times.\nPresident Obama once said that the American youth needs education that will make them possess 21st century skills like problem solving and critical thinking, entrepreneurship and creativity. This is because economic progress and educational achievement have always gone hand in hand.\nIt was the belief of Professor Julius Ihonvbere while delivering a Foundation Day Lecture of Lead City University, Ibadan, that Nigerian youths need even a higher level of that standard, especially in this internet age.\n“Rancid educational and economic policies that pay cursory attention to unemployment, coupled with unyielding and formidable peer pressure, are combined attractions for crime for the present day youth.”\nIt was noted that the leaders are no longer trusted and the mill of the antisocials enlarges by the day. No wonder we have armed robbers, political thugs, kidnappers, religious/tribal fanatics, drug couriers, yahoo yahoo boys all of them designed to cut corners. And they all passed through one school or the other. Against this background, there is urgent need for massive employment in order to check youth restiveness.\nA nation not interested in developing the youth (as is the case of Nigeria), will only be stranded in the earliest forms of pre-industrial and primitive stages of existence.\nAccording to Ihonvbere, it is wicked for present day public office holders to insist that fresh graduates must be self employed without the enabling environment. In civilised world, it is the duty of government to ignite such a revolution in the youth.\nNone of the big economies which Nigeria aspires to be part, leaves her productive sectors to the vagaries of market forces just like that.\nSaturday Vanguard investi-gation showed most graduates of higher education are still looking for jobs rather than create jobs. Only about one out of one thousand graduates of Nigerian tertiary institutions get employment. The low level of entrepreneurial zeal among graduates of higher education can be attributed as the main reason why they are not starting their own businesses coupled with inability to access loans provided by some banks, especially bank of industry.\n“In fact, the major challenge is the take-off capital or seed money required for some of these graduates in moving forward,” declared Engr. B.A. Odufuwa, Chairman, Governing Council, Lagos City Polytechnic in the 5th Convocation address.\nMany eminent persons and scholars have also pointed to entrepreneurship education as a bail out from unemployment.\nThe Vice Chancellor, Ondo State University of Science and Technology, Prof Tolu Odugbemi affirmed that one major outstanding feature of the institution is the emphasis on entrepreneurial training and skill development for the students.\n“Our students are being trained in over 20 various vocational skills aside from their normal academic pursuit to make them self-reliant, independent and job creators after their graduation,” he told this writer recently. He expressed concern over the teeming number of graduates produced annually by universities without employment opportunities.\nSimilarly, Covenant University, Ota, runs a Centre for Entrepreneurial Development Studies (CEDS) aimed to develop capacity to nurture the talents and ideas of students to create and sustain businesses and become creators of jobs, not job seekers. Prof. Pat Utomi, at the 4th Convocation Lecture of Redeemer’s University, titled “Entrepreneurship as panacea for unemployment in the 21st century – The Role of the University”, said that entrepreneurship is a fundamental part of our human dignity and it goes beyond passing a course but using what one has learnt and apply the knowledge in what one is primarily engaged in to create value and wealth.\nOn the other hand, it is believed that federal government’s 2013 budget would not favour job creation needed to tackle unemployment as allocations to infrastructure such as electricity, roads, etc are grossly inadequate.\nIt was also noted by stakeholders that banks have zero tolerance for risk and this is stifling private sector growth and capacity of entrepreneurs to create jobs.\nLack of skills has been identified as the reason many of our graduates are unemployable in the first place.\nAccording to a human capital development expert, Mr. Williams Ibiyinka, there is a clear difference between acquiring university education and acquiring skills.\nHuman capital or skill development is another strategy to reduce unemployment in this country. A lot of stakeholders want efforts to be intensified to ensure that youths are productively engaged and government provides necessary infrastructure to establish small and medium enterprises so as to reduce unemployment.\nAgain poverty level seemed to have risen, according to the National Bureau of Statistics.\nThe Statistician-General of Nigeria, Dr. Yemi Kale was reported in the press as saying:\n“It remains a paradox that despite the fact that the Nigerian economy is growing, the proportion of Nigerians living in poverty is increasing every year. This trend may have increased further if the potential positive impacts of several anti-poverty and employment generation intervention programmes are not taken into account.”\nIf the federal government is sincere with promises being made to provide millions of job for the unemployed, then the nation should be seeing signs towards that direction. “But what we have are mere slogans without concrete actions to show as the unemployment situation worsened.\nI left school since 2006, till today nothing to do. I don’t have sufficient capital to go into productive business,” laments Mr. Tuoyo Paul, an accounting graduate of University of Benin.\nAnother engineering graduate of University of Ibadan who has spent the past five years going about looking for employment (names not disclosed) said the situation is highly frustrating and embarrasing.\n“Most employers give conditions like obtaining second class upper, not above 25 years and some years of experience. It’s just too bad.”\nThe construction sector, agriculture, environment, housing, can throw up thousands of jobs for youths if government can harness the potentials for national development.\n“But government has left these options open to foreigners to exploit at the expense of our teeming young population seriously trapped by unemployment,” said Rotimi Funsho, an economist.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"http://www.vanguardngr.com/2012/11/unemployment-nigeria-sitting-on-keg-of-gun-powder/4","2":"2374","3":"Politics","4":"2","5":"en","6":"0.9999313354"},{"0":"Captain Chinyelu Chizoba Ndubuisi is the Pilot of Airforce 001, the aircraft that takes President, Muhammadu Buhari on local and international trips.\nCaptain Ndubisi is an Igbo man\nSpeaking on her Twitter handle the Personal Assistant on Social Media to President Muhammadu Buhari, Lauretta Onochie who post the photos of Captain Ndubuisi said ‘ for those who only remember Geography & skewed religious knowledge lessons, work out the rest.”\nWhat do you think she is talking about ?\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"https://www.vanguardngr.com/2017/12/captain-ndubuisi-buharis-airforce-001-pilot/","2":"136","3":"Travel","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.999630034"},{"0":"NEWCASTLE (AFP) – Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho could be set to ring the changes after launching a scathing attack on his players following their shock 2-0 defeat at Newcastle United.\nThe Chelsea manager left his squad in little doubt about his displeasure after an abject display saw them squander an opportunity to make ground in the Premier League title race.\nChelsea have an immediate chance to atone for a disjointed\nperformance — which Mourinho described as lacking in all departments — when they host German side Schalke in the Champions League this week.Several of the players who failed to impress at St James’ Park are unlikely to have an opportunity to restore their reputations immediately, with Mourinho ready to shake things up to avoid a repeat of the 90-minute no-show in the northeast.\nTaking his own share of the blame for a defeat that leaves Chelsea with just five points from five away league games so far this term, the Portuguese said: “I made 11 mistakes with my team selection — 11 mistakes.\n“That’s the feeling I have when my team plays so badly. We deserved to lose because for 45 minutes we played at the level of a friendly. The result is down to the fact that one team wasn’t there.\n“There was no aggression there and we lacked intensity. It was a bad performance and it sends me home with a lot to think about because I have to try and understand where a display like this came from. I have to admit I’d be worried if we play like that again.”\nMourinho concedes Chelsea’s patchy away form is a concern after they succumbed to second-half goals from French duo Yoan Gouffran and Loic Remy.\n“We’ve won just once away in the league this season and that worries me,” he said.\n“You have to come here to Newcastle with a certain mentality, and we just didn’t show that. We were lacking everything, to be honest, and that’s how I explain a result like this.\n“We’re 10 games in and it’s an open title race, but that’s not something I’m thinking about every week at the moment.

Any decision to zone must be discussed first before you say it is your turn.

So, we are breaking ourselves into units, so that we can actually do the door-to-door campaign. So, we are deemphasizing huge rallies and focusing more on small meetings. Again, we now need to actually spend more time on dissemination of information through the media, which means that we need the television, radio and newspapers.\nThere is the belief that some loyalists of Governor Godwin Obaseki, who did not defect to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) with him, might play the role of moles during the election. How is APC going to do deal with this issue?\nYes, we know that there are moles within the party but I want to assure you that we will deal with that. I will not elaborate on our plan to deal with that, but we will deal with it.\nTension is building up in Edo State ahead of the election. How can violence be averted before, during and after the poll?\nWe have said that we want this election to be issue-based. We don’t even want to resort to name-calling, let us focus on our agenda. I can assure you that we as party will do everything possible to avoid violence during the election and we hope that the other parties, especially the PDP will do the same because of what is already playing out.\nThey have campaign billboards and posters across the state; in fact they started erecting such billboards before us but we approached the agency of government in charge and asked about available spaces and the cost. They told us and we paid only to find out that a top official of the government said how can APC be allowed to have campaign billboards at strategic locations.\nThe next thing that happened was that they began to remove our campaign billboards but we have petitioned the commissioner of Police in Edo State and the state Director of the Department of State Services (DSS). Our campaign organization also addressed a press conference, where it made clear that the PDP must be accommodating and tolerant as well as well as avoid anything that will trigger violence. We could have taken the law into our hands but we didn’t do that. From that time till now, they have not mentioned that one of their billboards was destroyed by our supporters. So, I am assuring you that there will be no violence during the election as we will do our best and will cooperate with the security agents to make sure that election is peaceful.\nHave you been able to address those factors that worked against you in the 2016 governorship election?\nIf you had followed that election, you would have found out that despite the fact that I was coming from an opposition party in the state at that time, it was not easy for the ruling party. They had to postpone the election a day to it and brought it back after 18 days and when the result started coming out and I was leading, but you saw the drama that ensued and announcement of the results had to be stopped. By the time they came back, the whole thing had changed. But, when the Supreme Court says a particular person won, you don’t have to argue. However, I can assure that everything that happened then have been addressed and this time is our time.\nFormer Governor Adams Oshiomhole said all sorts of things about you during the last election, but you are working with him now. How do you react to that?\nYes, Oshiomhole threw punches at me in 2016, but people tend to have short memory. Oshiomole was at Ben Idahosa University, when I was being given a doctorate and he spent over one hour praising me for my contributions in his government and the role I am playing in the state. Oshiomhole also came to my farm at one time, when I was graduating students and he listed the roles I was playing in the state.\nAt my 50th birthday, there was no world he didn’t use to describe me including the fact that if he wants to mention those, who have helped him to succeed in government, there is no way my name will not be there. So, if during the campaigns for the 2016 governorship election he was abusing me because I was on the other side, what do you expect? Of course, he needed to abuse me, especially when he didn’t have a good product. You can imagine how Governor Godwin Obaseki started his camp for the forthcoming election. They placed a big screen on Ring road in Benin, where everybody passes and one would have thought that all he would be playing on that kind of screen are achievements of his administration in the last four years. Instead of that, he is playing about the governor of Kano State. It was when condemnation came from within and outside Nigeria that they had to stop it. What has the governor of Kano State got to do with the governorship election in Edo State apart from being the chairman of APC National Campaign Council? I am sure that those who had gone through campaigns before will tell you that people will call their opponents all sorts of names during electioneering campaigns, but if you allow those things to border you, they will distract you.\nIn fact, I confessed somewhere that they succeeded four years because I had my SIMPLE Agenda but I didn’t talk about it as I spent all the time replying their insults. Everyone knew that I had the SIMPLE Agenda but I didn’t talk about what I had, which they never had. This time I will not allow myself to be distracted; I will tell Edo people about my SIMPLE Agenda.\nAre you going to limit yourself to just one term in office if you win the election?\nWhen you are elected; are you elected to serve for two terms? You serve one term at a time and one term is four years, not eight years. So, in terms of planning, don’t leave any of your projects to run for an eight-year period or 20 year-period. If you want people to appreciate what you are doing or you want your agenda to be measurable and achievable, let it be within the period of your tenure. So, when I say four years, I am clearly conscious of the number of years a tenure is. Again, we are not God and nobody knows who will be alive tomorrow and death is not determined by age or position. So, why don’t we talk about what is on ground and leave the future to God?\nWhat is your take on security votes and are you going to stop it?\nI won’t say that I will stop security votes because what is important is what you use it for. I can’t make security a cardinal part of my agenda and there are no security votes; it is ridiculous. How do you handle security matters without financial votes? But the money you put in will determine or reflect the seriousness you attach to that area. So, for me, part of the security votes apart from going to the security agencies should also go to vigilant groups. They should not be working for gratis.\nHow can communities raise people, who are guarding farmlands and rural roads and government will not send them anything as support? Today, all the forests in Edo State have been taken over by criminals. If security votes were well managed by the present administration in the state, those forests would have been cleaned out. So, let use security votes judiciously and not see it as money for the governor.","1":"https://thenationonlineng.net/there-is-vacancy-in-edo-government-house/","2":"1646","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999980927"},{"0":"By Emma Una\nCALABAR —PEACE Mass Transit,

Turaki\nPeoples Democartic Party, PDP, presidential Aspirant and former Minister of Special Duties and Intergovernmental Affairs, Kabiru Tanimu Turaki, has said that the ruling APC government is scared and has gone into a desperation mode and inflicting vendetta on politicians holding contrary opinion because the opposition parties have decided to unite more than ever before to wrest power from them.\nHe said that the APC is jittery also, because Nigerians have determined to take their destiny in their own hands by acquiring their Permanent Voters’ Cards to vote out the ruling party and its baggage of propaganda, poverty, unemployment, insecurity, hopelessness, intimidation and violation of rights and the rule of law.\nThe presidential aspirant stated this at the Ondo State PDP secretariat in Akure on Wednesday, in continuation of his consultations with state executive committees, delegates and elders of the party ahead of the PDP’s national convention.\nTuraki accused the APC of extreme discriminatory approach to the fight against corruption which, he noted, was spearheaded and reinforced by the PDP at the onset of the current democratic dispensation in 1999.\nHe noted that ironically, a sizable number of the APC’s current bigwigs including some defectors in their ranks, were part and parcel of the past PDP administrations labeled as corrupt by APC which ceased to hound them with the EFCC once they defected, while loyal PDP leaders were being investigated and discredited in the media even when the law do not justify such an action.\nHe pointed out that corruption is not about money only, and asked: “When you give your own people unfair advantage in employment as the APC is doing now, or when people or groups are being treated unfairly simply because they do not come from your area or did not vote for you, what is that?”\nHe also accused the government of destroying the economy which it inherited on May 29, 2015 as the fastest-growing in Africa and number three in the world after China and Qatar, and pledged that visionary economic policies and highly knowledgeable and respected experts would be put in place to restore the sector to the glorious era.\nTuraki who was once the chairman, Presidential Committee on Dialogue and Peaceful Resolution of the Security Challenges in the North East said that the security challenges bedeviling the country currently will be tackled in a much more robust and effective manner, if given the chance to serve.\nHe lamented that Nigerians had never been so divided as now with an increased resurgence of agitations for self-determination and pledged that, as a bridge builder, he will ensure a turnaround situation that would bring peace and trust required to galvanize the people for accelerated development.\nHe said: “The situation in Nigeria today is so serious that we must come together to tighten our nuts to make the Nigerian Project solid.”\nTuraki, who commended the current PDP national leadership led by Prince Uche Secondus for its policy of justice, equity and fairness, traced the genesis of the party’s recent crisis and the steps which he and other concerned members took in salvaging the PDP from disintegrating.\nHe therefore warned that members should resolve never to allow charlatans again to determine their affairs.\nThe Ondo State chairman of the party, Engineer Clement Faboyede remarked that Turaki had won their hearts with his dynamism, and the intellectual depth and eloquence of his analysis of how to make Nigeria greater, while the chairman of the elders committee, Professor Olu Agbi said that he saw in the aspirant, a leader who would re-unite and take the country to the desired level of development in the 21st century..\nComments

$250m into power generation expansion project, marks one year on Stock Exchange\nBy Prisca Sam-Duru\nTo say that it is ‘appalling and disheartening’ that Nigeria’s power sector is yet to witness the needed improvement for greater impact on the people and the economy despite the huge amount of money sunk into it by successive governments is an understatement.\nThat, however, was how the Executive Chairman, Board of Directors, Geregu Power Plc, Mr Femi Otedola described the state of the power sector during the week.\nOtedola who though, who acknowledged that the sector has its challenges, noted however that, they are surmountable problems. The major problem he pointed out, is transmission and everyone wonders as he did, why it has seemed impossible for successive governments to fix the issue of transmission.\nBaring his mind on the sector while speaking at the “Closing Gong ceremony” and commemoration of the first Annual General Meeting (AGM) of the company on the floor of the Nigerian Exchange Limited (NGX) in Lagos, Otedola revealed the hard truth that if the power sector was well organised it would be cheaper and have a lot of positive impact on the manufacturing sector as well as the entire economy of the country.\n“The power sector has a lot of problems but they’re surmountable problems. It’s a matter of leadership in the country and willpower. If power is well organised, it’s even cheaper.\n“We will get there, it’s a matter of time.”\nThe business mogul queried why it’s difficult for the country to improve on the amount of power it generates when an individual like Aliko Dangote, has built 2000 megawatts for his plants. “Aliko, an individual has built 2000 megawatts of power for cement, fertilizer plants and refinery. And the country where I was born, has only 5000 megawatts. “So it’s appalling and disheartening that all the successive governments have failed in this regard but I believe we are now at the stage where the power sector will get a lot of attention and priority. We have new plants still sitting idle that the government built years ago and the real problem is transmission, there is a need to look in this direction,” he said.\nHe further said that Geregu was taking necessary steps to expand its capacity to deliver improved performance and maximise shareholders’ wealth, stressing that the challenges in the sector could be tackled if the government sets its priority right. For starters, he believes that the best way would be the engagement of investors in the sector.\n“Any government that thinks well will look for entrepreneurs in this sector that have committed so much capital and time and let them sort out the problem.\n“If the government then did not invite Aliko to build a cement factory and create an enabling environment, today we’ll still be importing cement.”\nWhile celebrating Geregu’s achievements on its first anniversary as a listed company, Otedola emphasised that for any company to sustain its wealth, there was a need for it to be listed on the stock exchange.\n“To sustain wealth, you need to list your company on the stock exchange”, he stated, adding, “We’ve come with a lot of firsts; the first power company to list on the Exchange, the first power company to embark on an aggressive 300 % expansion drive; the first company to release its results on the stock market.”\nIn a related development, Doron Grupper, a director of the power holding company, who is satisfied with the achievements of the power company so far, disclosed that Geregu boasts of professionals and good management to increase its capacity. “I’ve been with Geregu for years now since we started the power station. I think this power station according to my experience, works on natural gas. We have a great team of professionals, and good management to increase our capacity.\n“We are producing today, 450 megawatts but we have the potential for the next two years to increase to 1300 megawatts. We have the money, and we have the people but we need the assistance of the government of Nigeria to solve some problems with the gas issues.\n“We have a huge potential to increase and to contribute to Nigeria in the power sector and to increase the quantities and capacity of electricity to the people of Nigeria.”\nGrupper who spoke to Arise, TV correspondent, on the sideline of the NGX event on Tuesday, stated that the gas challenges have to do with the price of gas which he noted, is still low so there’s a need to increase it. The challenges also have to do with the quantity of gas and, “the pressure of the pipeline; we need to increase it. These are the three main issues that the government need to take care of and to assist us to increase the capacity.”\n“I hope that in the near future, we will come into a new era of electricity here in Nigeria,” he added.\nOn how much investments have been put in Geregu, he said, “When we bought the power station back in 2015 we produced 113 megawatts. We made a major overhaul to get to 450. Now, we are doing a major overhaul again…more than 250 million dollars altogether.”\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"https://www.vanguardngr.com/2023/04/nigeria-has-generated-only-5000-megawatts-since-i-was-born-femi-otedola-laments/","2":"1162","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999866486"},{"0":"Governors’ visits to Wike, Udom stir anxiety in APC\nVisits harmless, says spokesman\nTambuwal: we’re not politicking\nThere is disquiet in the All Progressives Congress (APC) over some governors’ visits to Rivers State Governor Nyesom Wike and Akwa Ibom State Governor Udom Emmanuel, who are of the Peoples Democratic Party. (PDP).\nThe APC governors, who visited their PDP counterpart, are: Abdulaziz Yari (Zamfara), Aminu Waziri Tambuwal (Sokoto) and Atiku Bagudu (Kebbi).\nThe governors also jointly hosted Wike in Sokoto- an action that sent political circles guessing that a major plan was on.\nA minister protested to the APC leadership in the Northwest over the trips, The Nation learnt yesterday.\nSome Presidency officials are also said to be disturbed by the signal which the visits generated.\nSome APC leaders were “shocked” that Tambuwal and Bagudu visited Wike before the last legislative election rerun in Rivers State, spending a day with him.\nThe two governors teamed up with Yari, who is also the Chairman of the Nigeria Governors Forum (NGF), to spend Christmas in Akwa Ibom.\nWike reciprocated the visits last weekend when he went to Sokoto. The Rivers State Governor was at the Sultan’s palace where he said the Niger Delta would not be part of any move to dismember Nigeria, adding that Nigeria’s unity is not negotiable.\nA source, reflecting on the development, spoke of “unease in the APC on the shuttles by Tambuwal and others to Rivers and Akwa Ibom states”.\n“Some of our leaders are uncomfortable with snippets from these trips”, he said, asking not to be named.\n“The timing of the first visit to Rivers State made some of our leaders to be suspicious. It was like paying a solidarity visit to Wike ahead of the Rivers State rerun elections.\n“Some leaders have been suspecting that the three governors might be the arrowheads of a political realignment in the country.”\nThere have been talks of a new party ahead of the next general elections. The direction and planners of the “mega” party remain unknown.\nThe source quoted the angry minister as saying; “We heard what you people are planning.”\nA party leader said: “Some of us have been angry with these governors because our members are going through hell in these states.\n“There is nothing wrong in exchanging visits or comparing notes, but we saw the trips as missteps at a time we are seeking redress or justice for our members in the affected states.\n“Of what use is an APC governor’s romance with a PDP governor in whose state APC members were attacked and maimed or where policemen were beheaded?”\nThe Department of State Services (DSS) last week gave indications that some politicians are under watch.\nThe politicians include those who are making “inciting” statements.\nIt could not be immediately ascertained if the governors in question are under watch.\nBut one of the governors had complained that his telephone conversations were intercepted by security agents.\nAnother source close to one of the governors added: “Of recent, we observed that some agents of a minister have been abusing our boss online over some of these visits.\n“It is unfortunate that friendly visits are being turned into other things. Some of these governors have been friends before getting into office.”\nAPC National Publicity Secretary Bolaji Abdullahi said: “My reaction will be that I think we should not read too much political meanings to all these trips. Governors socialise, regardless of party affiliation.\n“If governors decide to visit each other and socialise, I don’t think the party has the authority to stop them. I think we should not read any meaning into it.\n“But if the party has reasons to suspect gatherings are contrary to what the party stands for, the party will meet and take appropriate action. At this moment, there is no basis for that.”\nAlhaji Imam Imam, Tambuwal’s Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, said: “There is nothing political at all with all these shuttles. The commitment of the governor of Sokoto State to APC is not in doubt at all. Tambuwal is fully committed to APC. Our commitment to the President, the leadership of the party and all APC structures is unshaken and undiluted.\n“We work within the confines of APC. Nobody should link us with 2019. During political season, we will engage in politicking. But this is a period of governance; we are now focused on governance.”\nImam added: “Tambuwal believes in inter-state trade. So long as states cooperate among themselves, the potential for the nation’s economic growth is large.

We have credible intelligence that Sheriff had a meeting on Sunday night with an APC governor from North West, where it was agreed that he would be given full security and financial support to exacerbate the crisis in the PDP with the objective of preventing the PDP from presenting a candidate for the Edo governorship elections, or in the very least to prevent the PDP from offering a serious challenge to APC whose electoral fortunes has continued to nose-dive”.\nWhile expressing reservation of the committee on the role of the police in the whole saga leading to Senator Sheriff taking over the party’s secretariat, Prince Adeyeye said the role of the police has indicated that there was a superior authority directing the chain of events.\n“Up to a point, the police discharged their responsibilities satisfactory. However, later on without any justification whatsoever, Ali Modu Sheriff and the other renegades were allowed to gain entry into the secretariat, where they later proceeded to address a press conference.\n“While we are still trying to understand the role of the police in the entire saga, it is curious that the police made no arrest of the thugs who openly brandished various dangerous weapons in and around the premises of the secretariat in full glare of the police. It is also curious that the police claimed to be acting on “orders from above” in allowing Sheriff and his cohorts to gain entry into the secretariat.

In a deserted Gamboru, Chadian forces carried out clean-up operations after entering the town and retaking it from Boko Haram, which seized control months ago. AFP PHOTO / MARLE\nABUJA — Chadian soldiers have killed more than 200 Boko Haram terrorists as the soldiers recaptured Nigerian town of Gamboru after the Islamist terrorist group attacked a military base in Cameroon and were chased into north-eastern Nigeria.\nIn the encounter, according to Chad’s military chief in a statement, nine Chadian soldiers were killed and 21 injured when the insurgents attacked the base of the Multinational Joint Taskforce, a coalition Chad, Niger and Nigeria formed to fight Boko Haram.\nChad’s military chief said: “We regret nine dead and 21 wounded. On the enemy side, more than 200 deaths…,” adding that the toll could rise since clean-up operations in the Nigerian town of Gamboru were continuing.\nThe Chadian soldiers reportedly pursued the Boko Haram fighters into Nigeria and followed them to their bases in the towns of Gamboru and Ngala in Borno State, the general said in a statement published on the Chadian news website, Al Wihda.\nSoldiers destroyed a dozen Boko Haram vehicles loaded with heavy weapons and about a hundred motorbikes and seized a canon, according to the statement.\nAccording to a source with Nigeria’s Defence Ministry on the condition of anonymity, “Gamboru has been liberated, and that came with a serious cost to Boko Haram.” The multinational troops are working in tandem to rout out these elements.\nAbout 2,000 Chadian soldiers were stationed along the border this week after the African Union agreed on January 31 to send 7,500 troops to fight Boko Haram.\nIn Gamboru, the offensive, which was preceded by days of Chadian air strikes, had left scenes of desolation, with bodies lying on the ground, houses destroyed, shops gutted and trucks charred.\n“We have routed this band of terrorists,” the commander of the Chadian contingent Ahmat Dari told AFP Tuesday, vowing to “hunt them down everywhere.”\nNigeria’s sovereignty not compromised —DHQ\nNigeria has reacted defensively to the presence of foreign troops on its soil.\n“Nigeria’s territorial integrity remains intact,” defence spokesman Chris Olukolade insisted, claiming national forces had “planned and are driving the present onslaught against terrorists from all fronts in Nigeria, not the Chadian forces.”\nRegional forces have gone into action on several fronts.\nNigerian and Chadian war planes have been bombing Boko Haram hideouts since Monday.\nDefence spokesman, Chris Olukolade, said Tuesday that Nigeria’s sovereignty was not compromised by the presence of Chadian troops because all units were working in cooperation.\nThe insurgents are in control of about 130 villages and towns in northern Nigeria\nA security source said, “when the Chadians entered Gamboru, the Boko Haram members who were in the town and some villages fled and clashed with Cameroon soldiers at Fotokol as the Islamists fled an offensive by Chad’s army. Fighting between them and our soldiers is really intense.”\nChadian jet fighters had also bombed Gamboru before its troops entered.\nBoko Haram fighters were said to have gone on the rampage in the Cameroonian border town of Fotokol, yesterday, killing civilians and torching a mosque before being repelled by regional forces.\nSome of the insurgents escaped and slipped back across the border into Fotokol at dawn to make a fresh attack. “Boko Haram inflicted so much damage here this morning. They have killed dozens of people,” Umar Babakalli, a resident of Fotokol, told AFP by telephone.\nCivilians killed, houses burnt\nSeveral residents said civilians’ throats were slit and that the town’s main mosque was torched. “They burnt houses and killed civilians as well as soldiers,” a source close to security forces said.\nAnother resident who had fled to another town told AFP he knew of at least 10 people who had been killed.\nAfter several hours of clashes Cameroonian troops, backed by Chadian forces who scrambled back from Nigeria to help guard the town, managed to repel the assault.\n“People are coming back little by little to assess the damage. The survivors among the attackers have left the town,” a source close to the Cameroonian security services said. No official death toll was immediately available.\nThe sound of automatic gunfire could still be heard Wednesday in the town as the troops combed the town for remaining rebel elements.\nChadian troops and vehicles have massed near Boko Haram-held towns along Nigeria’s border with Niger, pointing the way to another possible cross-border operation on that frontier..\n“A contingent of about 400 vehicles and tanks is stationed between Mamori and Bosso,” Niger’s private radio Anfani reported Tuesday.\nFrance is supporting the operations by carrying out reconnaissance flights over border areas of Chad and Cameroon to provide them with intelligence, defence officials in Paris said.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"http://www.vanguardngr.com/2015/02/chadian-soldiers-kill-200-boko-haram-terrorists","2":"1133","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999599457"},{"0":"APC National Chairman, Abdullahi Adamu.\nOmeiza Ajayi, Abuja\nNational Chairman of the ruling All Progressives Congress APC, Senator Abdullahi Adamu has written to congratulate the presidential candidate of the party, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu on his emergence as standard bearer of the party at its 2022 Special Convention and Presidential Primary.\nAdamu had in the lead up to the exercise demonstrated open animosity towards Tinubu who he said would be severely sanctioned for publicly recalling how he (Tinubu) helped President Muhammadu Buhari to power in 2015.\nThe party chair had also announced Senate President Ahmad Lawan as the preferred consensus presidential aspirant of the party, a move that was fiercely resisted by critical stakeholders of the party including members of the National Working Committee NWC.\nHowever, in a congratulatory letter to Tinubu on Wednesday night, Adamu said the emergence of the former Lagos State Governor as standard bearer of the APC has now vindicated the party’s nationalistic outlook and patriotic disposition.\nHe said; “I present to Your Excellency, Senator Bola Ahmed Tinubu, my compliments and those of the members of the National Working Committee of the All Progressives Congress, in the best of traditions.\n“I write on behalf of the entire membership of the All Progressives Congress to congratulate Your Excellency on the sterling victory that you recorded at the just concluded Special National Convention to emerge as the Presidential Candidate of our great Party.\n“Your victory has vindicated our Party’s nationalistic outlook and patriotic posture as the Party of choice for every Nigerian.

He rather asked Nigerians to pray for the President for him to have the grace to execute the demands of his office.\nThe governor’s assertion came as a fringe group in the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, which called itself the PDP Media Watchdogs demanded the President’s resignation upon comments made in South Africa on Monday night.\nThe PDP Media Watchdogs was immediately disowned by the mainstream PDP which claimed ignorance of the group, saying that the language of the group was strange to the party’s posture, which is to only engage in healthy opposition to the administration. The PDP nevertheless, said that the PDP Media Watchdogs may have been instigated by the kind of bitter language used by the All Progressives Congress, APC, against former President Goodluck Jonathan while he was in power.\nThe ruling APC equally chided the PDP Media Watchdogs, describing their call as the product of deliberate mischief and a result of their members’ poor understanding of the English language.\nSpecial Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Mr. Femi Adesina, clarifying remarks given by the President to the Nigerian community in Johannesburg in a statement titled- “Like Good Wine, President Buhari Gets Better With Age”, said:\n“On Monday evening, President Muhammadu Buhari spoke with the Nigerian community at the Nigerian Consulate in Johannesburg, South Africa.\n“Speaking extempore, because according to him, he wanted to “speak from the heart,” the President urged them to be good ambassadors of Nigeria, a country he went to the war front to keep together.\n“Still extolling the virtues of our country, Nigeria, the President, who had served as a military governor of the then North-Eastern State at 33 years old, declared: ”I wish I became Head of State when I was a governor. Now at 72, there is a limit to what I can do.”\n“The above comments have been reported by some newspapers to mean that the President was saying he was too old to cope with the demands of his office. Far from it.\n“As the saying goes, “old wines are tasty” and the President Buhari we have today is a man, like old wine, that has got tastier. At 72, yes, he can’t be called a youth, but he has in quantum the wisdom, the patience, temperance and forbearance that age brings. And all these virtues he has brought to the Presidency, to make a difference in our national life.\n“The President assured the Nigerian community in South Africa that his administration will make a positive impact on the country.\n“Insecurity, as symbolized by insurgency, will be brought to an end, corruption will be fought to a standstill, employment will be created for the teeming army of unemployed, the economy will be revived, and the quality of life of Nigerians will take an upward swing again. These will not come by a sudden flight, but they will happen in the life of this administration.\n“At 72, the Buhari persona has not changed. He remains the simple, honest, incorruptible patriot he has always been. And because Nigerians earnestly desired change, that was why they voted for him overwhelmingly at the general elections in March, this year. All the virtues and values of the Buhari persona will be deployed into governance in the weeks and months ahead.\n“The Nigerian community in South Africa was enthralled as President Buhari spoke with them on Monday. In fact, leaving the venue was an effort, as they swarmed around the President, who shook hands with as many of them as he could.\n“They took his message well. That is the essence of good wine. It gets better with age. And it is a message for all Nigerians, both at home and in the Diaspora.”\nPray for Buhari — Fayose\nGovernor Fayose, who had during the campaigns raised issues about the President’s age, was very conciliatory yesterday, urging that the comments should not be politicised even as he called for prayers for the President to discharge his duties.\n“No, no, we cannot comment on that, but all that we owe the President is to pray for him to be able to do the demands of his office,” the governor’s spokesman, Mr. Lere Olayinka said yesterday.\n“Election is gone, and all that was done in the past is past and the time for election campaign is gone,” he restated yesterday.\nPDP fringe group flays Buhari\nEarlier, yesterday, a fringe group in the opposition PDP had upon the published assertion demanded the resignation of President Buhari from office for the reason of dwindling productivity in old age.\nThe group in a statement issued by one Tunde Lawal said:\n“It’s barely three weeks into the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari and his age is already telling on him, so, what will happen to Nigeria in the remaining 1,440 days of this government? It’s better to find a black goat in the day time rather than looking for it in the night and this is why we are asking President Buhari to resign now because Nigerians will not entertain further excuses of why the APC cannot deliver on its campaign promises.”\nNot part of us— PDP\nThe group was immediately disowned by the mainstream PDP which through a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Chief Olisa Metuh said:\n“This group is absolutely unknown to the PDP and has no connection whatsoever with our party at any level, neither is the content of their statement a reflection of the position or stance of the party.\n“For the avoidance of doubt, our great party has not authorized this group to use its name, acronym or logo to issue statements or make public pronouncements on any matter and we caution those behind them to henceforth desist from such immediately.\n“The PDP, therefore, distances itself from the embarrassing statement by this group wherein it called on President Muhammadu Buhari to resign and went ahead to use offensive and denigrating language on the person and office of the President of our great country.\n“This is completely unacceptable and against the posture of the PDP to engage only in robust and credible opposition while constructively offering alternatives to the programmes and policies of the APC-led government, preparatory to our return to power in the next four years.\n“We note with dismay that the attitude of this group is a direct consequence of the approach adopted by the APC in denigrating and insulting our immediate-past President, Dr. Goodluck Jonathan. “Though we know that former President Jonathan suffered such fate in the hands of the APC, we shall not repay them in the same coin as such is not part of our tradition and values as a party.\nResponding to the PDP Media Watchdog, the National Publicity Secretary of the APC, Alhaji Lai Mohammed in a statement accused the group of mischief and of poor knowledge of the English language.\n“What President Buhari was saying, which was lost on those who issued that jejune statement, is that only his love and passion for the country could have made him, at his age, to come out of retirement to seek the office of President, over 30 years after he presided over the affairs of the country.\n“For 16 years, Nigerians gave the PDP the benefit of the doubt to move the country forward, but instead, the party put Nigeria in reverse gear at a high speed, spinning it towards a doomsday that was only averted when Nigerians showed the PDP the red card. This is what necessitated President Buhari to continuously seek the country’s highest political office, so he can help put the country on a forward march again. Nothing else matters, not for him the excitement of an office he previously held and the quest for personal accomplishment.\n“If the country had been well managed, President Buhari will not at 72 be crisscrossing the whole world seeking solution to Nigeria’s problems”, it said.\nThe party said only anarchists and non-democrats will ask a president who has not spent one month in office to resign, adding: “It rankles when those making these calls are from the ranks of the party that failed to avail itself creditably in 16 years.”\nLabour Party blasts president\nThe National Chairman of Labour Party, Alhaji Abdukadir Abdulsalam also flayed the remarks by the president, saying it was an admission of failure.\nSpeaking to newsmen in Abuja, yesterday, Abdulsalam said: “This is an expression of failure on his part because when he was campaigning, he gave us the impression that he was hale, healthy, and not fragile, has the capacity, ability and agility to carry out the function of state as the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.”\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"http://www.vanguardngr.com/2015/06/old-age-wont-affect-my-job-buhari/#sthash.7iDtMNPx.dpufcc","2":"2179","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.999994278"},{"0":"By Johnbosco Agbakwuru\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari will make a national broadcast on Thursday, February 16, 2023, at 7 am.\nThis was disclosed in a statement issued by the Special Adviser to the President of Media and Publicity, Chief Femi Adesina.\nAccording to the statement, “Television, radio stations and other electronic media outlets are enjoined to hook up to the network services of the Nigerian Television Authority and Radio Nigeria for the broadcast.”\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"https://www.vanguardngr.com/2023/02/breaking-naira-redesign-buhari-to-address-nigerians-today/","2":"121","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9998264313"},{"0":"Seven ‘moments’ Nigerian women hit the ‘front-line’\nBy Alao Abiodun\nAt different points in Nigeria’s rich history, women have taken so many important positions in yearning for change.\nIt should come as no surprise that Nigerian women are sometimes on the front lines of political change. In many ways, history has always repeated itself.\nNigerian women have a long history of mobilising for protests and demonstrations, they have been frontliners, driving change where needed.\nSometimes, Nigerian women have historically employed ‘naked protests’ to seek change.\nOn July 23, 2020, hundreds of women – mostly naked – staged a protest in the northwestern state of Kaduna, Nigeria. They protested at the killing of people in their community.\nFrom the Women’s war protest of the 1910s to the Calabar Women Protest of 1924, the Aba Women’s Riot of 1929, the Abeokuta Women’s Revolt of the 1940s, the “Bring Back our Girls” movement of 2014, and the March against Rape of June 2020, #EndSARS movement, in many ways, women have determined the shape of how Nigerians protest.\nIn celebration of International Women’s Day 2021 themed as ‘Choose to Challenge’, here are seven moments in the history of Nigeria where Nigerian women were at the front-line.\n1. Women’s war protest of the 1910s\nIn the 1910s, women in Agbaja stayed away from their homes for a month in protest due to suspicions among them that some men had been secretly killing pregnant women.\nTheir collective absence pushed village elders to take action to address their concerns.\n2. Aba Women’s Riots of 1929\nThis was a period of unrest in colonial Nigeria.\nThe “riots” or the war was led by women in the provinces of Calabar and Owerri in southeastern Nigeria in November and December of 1929.\nThe protests broke out when thousands of Igbo women from the Bende District, Umuahia and other places in eastern Nigeria traveled to the town of Oloko to protest against the Warrant Chiefs, whom they accused of restricting the role of women in the government.\nThe Aba Women’s Riots of 1929, as it was named in British records, is more aptly considered a strategically executed revolt organised by women to redress social, political and economic grievances.\nThe protest encompassed women from six ethnic groups – Ibibio, Andoni, Orgoni, Bonny, Opobo, and Igbo.\nIt was reported that the war resulted in the death of 51 women.\n3. Calabar women protest of 1924\n3,000 women in Calabar went out to protest a market toll that was required by the government.\nWhen the Colonial officials announced the toll, the women disregarded it and went about their usual market activities but alas they were driven away by colonial police. This however led to a massive revolt by the women\nBack then, the presence of women associations and market women networks helped the protest movement.\n4. Abeokuta women’s revolt of the 1940s\nThese women spent several years protesting the tax increase and the lack of women representation in government.\nThey believed that until they were granted representation in local government, they shouldn’t pay taxes differently from men.\nThis revolt led to the creation of Abeokuta Women’s Union (AWU) under the leadership of Fumilayo Ransome-Kuti.\nThis political organisaton, united market women and middle-class women and also challenged the colonial rule and patriarchal structure.\n5. Bring Back Our Girls movement of 2014\nAfter over 200 girls were abducted from the school in Borno by Boko Haram insurgents, all eyes were on the Nigerian government to act swiftly.\nWhen the response of the government was not yielding positive results, women mobilised in Kaduna, Abuja, Lagos and across the country to protest for the rescue of these girls.\nThe #BringBackOurGIrls and #SaveOurGirls went viral and piqued the interest of the international community.\nWomen from all over the world joined the protest and over a million people signed the petition to mobilise world leaders to help rescue the girls.\n6. Protest against rape and sexual violence in June 2020\nIn June 2020, Nigerian women took to the streets after a series of high-profile rape cases caught the interest of the people.\nFollowing the story of 22-year-old Uwa Vera who was raped and murdered in a Church, more stories of women getting raped and killed surfaced online and this led to a protest organised by women.\nWomen mobilised and held a protest in Abuja and Lagos.\nThe hashtag #NOmeansNo trended online as more victims of rape shared their story. There was a movement to stop victim-blaming and to discourage people from enabling rape with their silence.\n7. #EndSARS movement – Feminist Coalition\nAt the forefront of the revolutionary youth-led movement against police brutality in Nigeria is the Feminist Coalition – a group of young Nigerian feminists collectively mobilizing all facets of the global #EndSARS protests.\nDuring the protests the non-governmental organisation raised $385,000 (£290,000) through crowdfunding and spent part of the money on legal services for those protesters who were arrested, to pay medical bills for those wounded, to provide private security at protest points and daily refreshments.\nThe coalition is the brainchild of Dami Odufuwa and Odun Eweniyi.\nFormed in July, the #EndSars protest was the organisation’s first major project.\nAlthough women’s safety and financial equality are at the core of the organisation’s aims, equality for all people is their vision, and so they decided to fight the injustice perpetuated by the squad by joining in the protests.\nThese women, named and unnamed, are the backbone of a series of resistance. By marching, volunteering, mobilizing, tweeting, speaking, donating, and flagrantly trampling on sexist, they are, without a doubt, the amplifiers of this historical Nigerian revolution.","1":"https://thenationonlineng.net/seven-moments-nigerian-women-hit-the-front-line/","2":"1300","3":"Politics","4":"3","5":"en","6":"0.9998044968"},{"0":"By Emma Ujah, Abuja Bureau Chief\nTHE federal government has paid another set of 14 whistleblowers the sum of N439.276 million for providing tips on tax evaders.\nThe Minister of Finance, Mrs. Kemi Adeosun, who briefed the press yesterday, in Abuja, disclosed that the payment was made this week, after the government received the sum of N13.8 billion from the affected tax evaders, mainly corporate organizations, based on tips by the whistle blowers\nHer words, “The Whistleblower Policy started December 2016. Since then, we have had 8, 373 37communications of which 1, 231 were actually tips.\n“We have conducted 534 investigations; 10 prosecutions and four convictions.\n“This week, we paid whistle blowers the sum of N439. 276 million, it was to 14 people who provided specific tips on tax evasions about companies who deliberately evaded or under-paid taxes. Working on those tips, we have held discussions with those companies and they have paid N13. 8 billion which we have confirmed have been paid to the Federal Inland revenue Service.\n“Under the VAIDS, We are getting far more tips on tax evasions, which of course is a crime against us all and this is a new trend that we thought is worth bringing to your attention. So these people, are being paid this month.\n“This is the first time we are having that number where we have concluded either communications with companies and the companies have actually paid the money to FIRS.”\nMrs. Adeosun said that the Whistleblowing strategy would be revising some of its mode of operations based on what the unit has learnt from a recent trip of its officials to the United kingdom.\nShe disclosed that the federal government was actively preparing cases for prosecution against tax evaders and that very serious actions would be taken at the end of next month, when the tax amnesty would end.\nPayroll irregularities being tackled with IPPIS\nOn the battle against ghost workers, the minister said that there were still some irregularities in the payroll but that her team was paying closer attention to details in the IPPIS to eliminate them.\nShe said, “For instance we are investigating some cases where name on the payroll is different from the name on the bank account.\n“We are looking at that. In some cases, it is as simple as some people got married and did not update their names but in other cases, it is a matter of fraud. This is just to give you an idea of how detailed we go and we keep checking the payroll on a regular basis.”\nMrs. Adesoun also said that over 100 properties of the nation’s foreign missions and federal government agencies which were not captured in an earlier audit were found. “Teams visited foreign missions and discovered that foreign missions and some government agencies had over 100 properties that were not recorded. Some abandoned. And some people trying to sell them off and we have to stop them,” she said.\nOn the performance of the 2017 Budget, she expressed optimism that at the end of the month, about N1. 5 trillion would have been spent on capital projects.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"https://www.vanguardngr.com/2018/05/fg-pays-14-whistle-blowers-n439m-2/","2":"683","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999904633"},{"0":"By Dayo Johnson\nAkure—NINETY TWO mud houses have been demolished in Akure, the Ondo State capital for the construction of N300 million Ultral Modern Motor Park in the state capital.\nConsequently, the state government has paid compensation to owners of the houses.\nCommissioner for Works and Infrastructure, Mr. Gboye Adegbenro said while inspecting progress of various construction works in Akure that the aim of the motor park was to de-congest traffic on major streets of the state capital\nAdegbenro said that the car park project had achieved 70 per cent completion.\nThe project according to him will be inaugurated as part of activities marking the third anniversary of the Governor Olusegun Mimiko administration adding that it will have a clinic, a police post, modern boreholes and fire service station among others.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"http://www.vanguardngr.com/2011/12/ondo-demolishes-92-houses-for-motor-park/","2":"195","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9998989105"},{"0":"BY VICTOR AHIUMA-YOUNG\nBARELY 24 hours after the Federal Government said it had approved N384 billion for the payment of entitlements of workers of the Power Holding Company of Nigeria, PHCN, Organised Labour has rejected government’s position, threatening to shut down the sector next week should government fail to reverse its position.\nUnder the umbrella of National Union of Electricity Employees, NUEE, labour wondered how the government arrived at N384 billion when the technical committee comprising government appointed actuarist – Alexander Forbes, Bureau for Public Enterprises, BPE, PHCN, and the unions charged with the responsibility of computing the exit package of PHCN staff was yet to conclude its assignment.\nReacting to government announcement through its General Secretary, Comrade Joe Ajaero, the workers argued that Alexander Forbes and BPE officials discovered and accepted fundamental errors in the data used for their computation in the course of the committee’s discussion and thus agreed to reconvene on a later date towards addressing the fundamental errors.\nAccording to the statement “It is therefore amazing that figures can be conjured to calculate the exit benefits without reference to the technical committee. The announcement is highly provocative.\n“The figure (N384billion) is laughable because government is also aware that one third of the staff population were excluded and majority of those captured had their entitlement calculated based on two grades lower than their actual grades”.\n“Besides, regularization of casuals who have been in the industry for a long period is yet to be concluded and the value of their exit benefits should form an integral part of the total package.\n“If the money (N384 billion) to be paid to the staff is to appreciate them for their concerted efforts towards the noticeable power improvement in the country, we shall gladly accept it and commend government for the largesse.\n“But if it is for our exit packages, then government should do the right thing. It is imperative to remind government that time without number it has made pronouncement to its commitment to the rule of law which unfortunately has not been demonstrated in this case. This can only be regarded as an act of impunity, since this figure was not a product of consensus by the parties involved in this matter.”\nIt added that. “Calculation of exit package not done on the basis of accurate data is totally unacceptable to us and shall be resisted through all legal means. The Technical and Implementation Committees should therefore be allowed to conclude their assignments without hindrance and resort to the use of armed forces to short change workers in the Sector. Besides, the use of Sacked workers the drivers of this process as lacking in the knowledge of Personnel and Industrial Relations. If it is not reversed, we would behave like Sacked workers effective next week.

It is an effort to gather facts based on various narrations by the different writers.\nIn January 1966, a bloody coup took place in Nigeria which claimed the lives of several important personalities.\nChukwuma Kaduna Nzeogwu is the visible leader of the bloody coup which led to the death of several Nigerian leaders particularly in the northern Nigeria.\nC.K. Nzeogwu was an infantryand intelligenceofficer of the NigerianArmy. He is an igbo man from eastern Nigerian, but was born in the north. His Hausa colleagues in the Nigerian Army gave him the name “Kaduna” because of his love with the town.\nNzeogwu and others who were mostly from the eastern part of the country planned and executed the coup which led to unrest in the country. The perceived tribal consideration of the new military head of state subsequently led to a counter coup and also the Nigerian civil war popularly known as the Biafran war.\nLate literal icon, Prof Chinua Achebe in his book titled, ''there was a country'' wrote about the Biafran war. The book generated a lot of controversy with the perceived sentimental account narrated by the revered writer, bringing back the tensed atmosphere of the civil war itself. Many prominent Nigerian countered the narration of the late writer and termed his book, igbo narration which contained sentiments rather than truth.\nAnother book, ''Half of a yellow sun'' written by Chimamanda Ngozie Adichie was another prominent narration of the civil war story from an igbo perspective which most Nigerian regarded as a sectional account of the reality of war. Both books depict igbo as victims, which many Nigerians feel otherwise, accusing the writers of false narration.\nAccording to the history as written on Wikipedia, In the early hours of January 15, 1966, Nzeogwu led a group of officers on a supposedly military exercise and led them to attack the official residence of the premier of the north Sir. Amadu Bello in a bloody Coup that saw the murder of the Premiers of Northern and Western Nigeria. The Prime Minister, a federal minister, two regional premiers, and top Army officers from the Northern and Western regions of the nation were brutally murdered. The premier of the Eastern region (where most of the plotters came from), the Igbo President of federation and the Igbo Army Chief were the only notable individuals spared . The coup failed, and he was later arrestedin Lagoson January 18, 1966.\nReliable account have it that, Nzeogwu could not have been responsible for sparing the Eastern politicians during the coup because he was in charge of the North, while fellow coupists who were equally from the east were in charge of the Eastern region.\nThe coup failed, as one of those marked for execution in the coupist plan ( G.O.C. Ironsi) seems to be awaren of the plot and was prepared to suppress it after a partial execution. Nzeogwu eventually surrender to Ironsi, but instead of restoring order to the appropriate political leadership, Ironsi at gun point forced the deputies of the civilian murdered leaders to hand over power to him which they did. He became the head of state and made some appointments.\nNzeogwu and other plotters were arrested and transferred to prison In eastern part of the country where they hail.\nThe leniency with which the new leader, General Aguiyi Ironsi (also an Igbo), handled the coup plotters led to the dissatisfaction of northern officers and subsequently resulted in a counter- coup on the 29th of July, 1966.\nIn Nzeogwu's wikipedia profile, it was reported this way, the coup d'état itself failed, as Ironsi rallied the military against the plotters. But Ironsi did not bring the failed plotters to trial as requested by military law and as advised by most northern and western officers. Ironsi then instituted military rule by subverting the constitutional succession and alleging that the democratic institutions had failed and that, while he was defending them, they clearly needed revision and clean-up before reversion back to democratic rule.\nIt was established according Wikipedia that, Nzeogwu was initially detained at the Kirikiri maximumsecurity prisonin Lagos, before later being transferred to the East. He and other January 15 mutinydetainees were subsequently released from jail by governor of the eastern region Lt. Col. Emeka Ojukwu (also an Igbo) at the end of the first quarter of 1967, following demonstrations by Igbo students of the University of Nigeria, Nsukka.\nOn May 30, 1967, The nation of Biafradeclared its independence from Nigeria. Nzeogwu was released from close observation, and asked to go into battle on the side of the Biafrans.\n3.0 UNKNOWN CONSPIRACY\nSince January 1966 when the first military coup took place in Nigeria, many have continued to argue about the agenda of the coup plotters.\nSome say it was a poorly executed national exercise,while others see it as a grand plot by a section of the country to seize power, but in the opinion of this writer, the coup seems to be carried out by two (2) ideological blocs which is unknown to some of the plotters, particularly Nzeogwu who was known as the visible leader of the coup.\nThe first ideological bloc include those who genuinely believe in the coup as a national exercise and are patriotic enough to want to lay their lives for the prosperity of the country. These group consist of Nzeogwu and few others.\nThe second ideological bloc was those coupists that were tribalistic in motive, but displayed patriotic outlook to convince others of their dedication to the national exercise. These group is represented primarily by those who were suppose to execute the coup in the eastern part of the country and probably some from among those who are to execute it in the western region.\nAccording to revelations that emerge from police investigation, it was revealed that the coup was initiated by the second ideological bloc before Nzeogwu was recruited, the coup planning started in August 1965, Nzeogwu was said be recruited in September that year.\nAccording to official police report of the coup's investigation.\nIn August 1965, three officers, Major Okafor, Major Ifeajuna and Captain Oji who were already dissatisfied with political developments in the Federation and the impact of these developments on the Army, held series of discussions between them about the matter and set about the task of searching for other officers who held views similar to their own and who could, eventually, be trusted to join them in the enterprise of staging a military coup d'etat.\nIn September 1965, Major I. H. Chukwuka of Nigerian Army Headquarters Lagos was persuaded to join the group of conspirators, followed in October 1965 by Major C. I. Anuforo, also of the Army headquarters.\nMajor Chukwuma. Kaduna. Nzeogwu was brought in around that time through the efforts of Major Anuforo, an old friend of both Majors Nzeogwu and Okafor. Major Nzeogwu in turn secured the support for the plan of Major A. Ademoyega who had worked with him in the Nigerian Army Training College Kaduna.\nBy early November, the recruiting activities of the group were completed and an inner circle of conspirators emerged.\nWe must note here that, the three (3) officers, Major Okafor, Major Ifeajuna and Captain Oji who initiated the coup were just the actual executors of the coup, there might be shadow parties involved that may have given these young officers the motivation and secret backing to go ahead with the coup before they recruited other members including Nzeogwu.\n3.1 WHY NZEOGWU WAS RECRUITED\nIt is a well known fact that Nzeogwu resent the way the country was being governed at that time.This can be seen in his speech after he successfully executed the plan in northern Nigeria.\nAccording to Nzeogwu, “Our enemies are the political profiteers, the swindlers, the men in high and low places that seek and take bribes and demand 10 percent (from contracts), those that seek to keep the country divided permanently so that they can remain in office as minister or VIPs at least, the tribalists, the nepotists, those that make the country look big for nothing before international circle, those that have corrupted our society and put the Nigerian political calendar back by their words and deeds.”— Kaduna Nzeogwu, January 1966\nHe never hides his resentment. It was also a well known fact that the only person capable of successfully eliminating the Northern leaders was a man like Nzeogwu who was well respected in the north despite being from the east.\nKnowing how much he was ready to get rid of all enemies of his beloved nation, it was easy to get him on board.\nAccording to a Nigerian historian MAX SIOLLUN,what is clear is that Nzeogwu had harbored some anti-government sentiment for several years before 1966.\nMax stated that, Nzeogwu's boss at the Nigerian Military Training College, Colonel Ralph Shodeinde, had in the past reported Nzeogwu to Army Headquarters for allegedly disseminating anti-government rhetoric to junior officers. Shodeinde's report claimed that Nzeogwu had been attempting to poison junior officers' minds against the Government (see Obasanjo: “An intimate portrait of Chukwuma Kaduna Nzeogwu”). Nzeogwu was so disillusioned with the farcical vote rigging that he exclaimed, “It is impossible to vote out a Nigerian minister.”\nExplaining how Nzeogwu recruited his team to execute the plot, Nigeria's former Defence Secretary, Lt-Gen Theophilus Danjuma who gave insight into how Nzeogwu's coup recruitment policy worked said. “Nzeogwu was a very charming person. He had his method, he would start by criticizing government and then watch your reaction…..if you joined him in criticising the government…..then he would say well, we would (sic) fix them one day. That's how he recruited.” Danjuma said.\nMax Siollun had stated that, Some claim that Nzeogwu's participation in the January 1966 coup was part of a grand Igbo agenda to “dominate” the country. He argues that this argument overlooks the fact that Nzeogwu was an Igbo in name only. Nzeogwu was born in the Northern Region's capital of Kaduna to Igbo immigrant parents from the Mid-West Region. Such was his family's affinity to the city of Nzeogwu's birth that they and his military colleagues called him “Kaduna.” When not in his army uniform he wore northern mufti and frequently referred to himself as “a northerner.” Nzeogwu spoke fluent Hausa (the lingua franca of the Northern Region) “like a native” (Forsyth). In fact Nzeogwu's command of Hausa was better than his command of Igbo. It is a mark of Nzeogwu's popularity that when his body was discovered during the Nigeria-Biafra War by federal soldiers, they took his body away for burial with full military honours (but not before his eyes had been plucked out). said Max.\nIn my opinion, the above argument by Max even gave further reason why Nzeogwu was recruited.\nFor such a coup to take place succesfully, there must be competent hand in all region to adequately take care of the identified enemies, but there was no way the initial plotters could convince nothern officcers close enough to the targets to join the plot. They needed someone with credibility enough to gain confidence of junior officers in the north, someone who could convince them to join in the implementation of the perceived national exercise. May be, just may be, Nzeogwu was recruited to fill such a strategic vacuum.\nHere, we must understand the nature of the igbo reasoning even in the present day Nigeria.\nAccording to an igbo associate of mine, Henry Chukwuma who felt frustrated about his effort to be an igbo as well as Nigerian faithfully, he stated that, ''tribalism for our people (igbo) is the order, while nationalism is an exception. Chukwuma noted that, our people know we are tribal and they are proud about it, in fact, we igbo's are exposed to ethnocentric ideas from childhood. Chukwuma said.\nHe further added that, any igbo man or woman not egocentric in nature is considered a bastard, adding that, any nationalistic igbo person may have been brought up outside igbo land or at least, must have traveled far and wide to balance his or her reasoning. If such individual actually grows up and live in the east, they are very rare and should be considered as special igbo, adding that, it would be difficult for such individuals to rally much support for any political engagement.\nChukwuma further added that,nationalistic igbo person is likely not to be trusted by most people in the east because they see them as likely saboteur against the igbo interest. To our people, it is either you are for igbo or against it. Henry said.\nChukwuma didn't stop there, he went further to say, we igbo are not just tribal to other tribes like Yoruba,Hausa and the rest, even among ourselves (igbo), our people are discriminatory against other igbo whom they consider as less igbo.\nFor example, people from Anambra are considered as the original igbo, while people from Imo are considered less igbo. Our Anambra igbo surely discriminate against Imo igbo. In any political or social engagement, hardly will Anambra igbo support Imo or others considered as less igbo to take leadership Chukwuma concluded.\nFrom the above, it could be said that, to some igbo's, igbo superiority against other tribes is a right that must be upheld by all igbo. If you consider other tribes like you consider igbo, you are likely to be regarded as untrusted or a likely saboteour to igbo interest. That may be the reason why Nzeogwu was unaware of the motives of other coupists from unset. He Nzeogwu later confessed, ''it was tribal in the south''.\nNzeeogwu was known to be nationalistic in view, and someone who may never consider participating in any sectional agenda.\nRecently, in an open electioneering campaign, an igbo man (Chris Ngige) who is merely in a political party other than known igbo dominated party (apga) was publicly declared an enemy by some igbo leadership in Anambra state. He was accused of contesting the election under Awolowo, Muslim or hausa party (APC). To them, it is a crime to belong to none igbo controlled party.\nAnother example can be seen in the Imo state Governor, Rochas Okorocha who is a nationalistic leader and a member of none igbo dominated party. He his mostly condemned by some igbo's for what they described as anti igbo (whatever that means).\nAlthough, not all igbo subscribe to such reasoning, but there are considerable number that does and such people stop at nothing to advance such interest through politics.\nSo, Nzeogwu may not have known about the plan of the eastern officers to betray the national exercise for sectional loyalty, a national exercise which may likely not exist in the heart of eastern coupist in the first place.\nIt may be deduced here sthat, while Nzeogwu is an igbo man by nature, the fact that he has different ideology from most igbo's cast him aside as a mere tool in the hand of the other plotters to achieve an earlier designed agenda before his recruitment. ex-Senate President Nwafor Orizu told Alhaji Shehu Shagari that Major Nzeogwu was \"an unknown entity among the Ibos (sic) in the Eastern region.\"\nMajor Abubakar A. Atofarati: CSC 1992 stated that, the aim of the coup is as follows:\nTo establish a strong, unified and prosperous nation, free from corruption and internal strife.\nThe outcome of the half-hearted and ill-fated coup was a change of political balance in the country.\nHere, it can be argued that, while Nzeogwu's interest and desire of officers in the first bloc lie in the aim, the interest and desire of the second bloc lie in the outcome as it was said, nothing ever happens in world politics without people planing it.\n3.2 CIVILIAN ADMINISTRATION NEVER HANDED OVER\nMany have also faulted how Aguinyi Ironsi took over power from the civilian administration. It was expected that, after the coup plotters were apprehended, power was suppose to be restored back to the civilian administration, but ironsi who seems to have other ideas took it for himself.\nWhile Ironsi said the civilian administration voluntarily handed power to him to restore order, that view was countered by various narrations of those who took active part in the process.\nAccording to Nowa Omoigui, In July 2000, at a public book launching ceremony in Nigeria, Chief Richard Akinjide stated:\n\"Talking on the first coup, when Balewa got missing, we knew Okotie-Eboh had been held, we knew Akintola had been killed. We, the members of the Balewa cabinet started meeting. But how can you have a cabinet meeting without the Prime Minister acting or Prime Minister presiding. So, unanimously, we nominated acting Prime Minister amongst us. Then we continued holding our meetings. Then we got a message that we should all assemble at the Cabinet office. All the Ministers were requested by the G.O.C. of the Nigerian Army, General Ironsi to assemble. What was amazing at that time was that Ironsi was going all over Lagos unarmed. We assembled there. Having nominated ZANA Diphcharima as our acting Prime Minister in the absence of the Prime Minister, whose whereabout we didn't know, we approached the acting President, Nwafor Orizu (igbo) to swear him in because he cannot legitimately act as the Prime Minister except he is sworn- in. Nwafor Orizu refused. He said he needed to contact Zik who was then in West Indies.\nUnder the law, that is, the Interpretation Act, as acting President, Nwazor Orizu had all the powers of the President. The GOC said he wanted to see all the cabinet ministers. And so we assembled at the cabinet office.\nWell, I have read in many books saying that we handed over to the military. We did not hand-over.\nIronsi told us that \"you either hand over as gentlemen or you hand-over by force\". Those were his words. Is that voluntary hand-over? So we did not hand-over. We wanted an Acting Prime Minister to be in place but Ironsi forced us, and I use the word force advisedly, to handover to him. He was controlling the soldiers.\nThe acting President, Nwafor Orizu, who did not cooperate with us, cooperated with the GOC. Dr. Orizu and the GOC prepared speeches which Nwafor Orizu broadcast handing over the government of the country to the army. I here state again categorically as a member of that cabinet that we did not hand-over voluntarily. It was a coup. \" Akinjide said.\nCorroborating Akinjide's account, Shehu Shagari in his Book \"Beckoned to Serve\" wrote,\n\"…....….At about 7.00 am, I returned to Dipcharima's residence to meet with some NPC ministers who had gathered there. Dipcharima was then the most senior NPC minister available. We received the latest reports on the situation, first from Alhaji Maitama Sule, Minister of Mines and Power, who had visited the PM's residence by bicycle! We then heard from Alhaji Ibrahim Tako Galadima, the acting Minister of Defence, who had brought along with him Chief Fani-Kayode.\nChief Fani-Kayode said he had been fetched from Ibadan early that morning by rebels and locked up at the Federal Guard Officers Mess in Dodan Barracks, where the mutineers initially made their headquarters. Disguised in army uniform, loyal troops handed him over to Alhaji Galadima, who had called in at the barracks, which was a stone's throw of his residence…………….The acting Minister of Defence assured us that Major-General Ironsi was doing his best to arrest the situation.\nMaitama Sule and I were separately detailed to explore with our absent NPC and NCNC colleagues the possibility of naming someone to stand in for the PM. I was consulting with NCNC ministers at Dr. Mbadiwe's residence when we heard that the Northern and Western premiers, Sir Ahmadu Bello and Chief Akintola respectively, had been assassinated. Hence I rushed back to Dipcharima's residence, where I found my colleagues in a state of shock and desperation.\nHowever, we decided to recognize Dipcharima, a Kanuri from Bornu, as our interim leader; and to ask the acting President, Dr. Orizu (President Azikiwe was away on leave), to appoint Dipcharima acting Prime Minister. We also summoned Major General Ironsi and gave him full authority to use every force at his disposal to suppress the rebellion. He moved his headquarters temporarily to the police headquarters at moloney street to facilitate easy communication with army units in the regions.\nWhile at Dipcharima's residence, we contacted the British High Commission and requested for military assistancein the event that our loyal troops should require any. The response was positive, but the British insisted that the request must be written by the PM; or, in his absence, by a properly appointed deputy. We, therefore, drove to the residence of Dr. Orizu, and requested him to appoint Dipcharima acting prime minister. Dr. Orizu requested to see our NCNC colleagues to confirm whether they supported our proposition, and they joined us soon afterwards. They had apparently been caucusing at Dr. Mbadiwe's residence. He (Mbadiwe) was their choice of acting Prime Minister. This was naturally unacceptable to us since the NPC was the major governing party.\nWhile we were at Orizu's residence, Major-General Ironsi, who had seemingly secured Lagos, came in with some armed escorts. He requested for a tete-a-tete with Orizu. The two had a 40 minutes discussion in another room, while we waited anxiously in the sitting room, with the armed soldiers standing and staring at us. When Major-General Ironsi finally emerged, he talked to Dipcharima sotto voce; and then drove off with his troops. Dr. Orizu then joined us, regretted his inability in the circumstances to oblige our request. He suggested we all return to our homes and wait until we were required. All efforts to get any clarification failed, and we left in utter desperation.\nI was about to break the Ramadan fast on Sunday 16th January, when all ministers were asked to report to the Cabinet Office at 6.30 pm. The whole premises was surrounded by soldiers in battle order that some of us initially hesitated to enter. In the Cabinet chamber were Major General Ironsi, Bukar Dipcharima and Ibrahim Tako Galadima. There were no officials present.\nMajor General Ironsi admitted to us that he had been unable to suppress the rebellion, which he said was getting out of hand. He stated that the mutineers were in control of Kaduna, Kano and Ibadan, and had killed two regional premiers, Sir Ahmadu Bello and Chief Akintola. They had also murdered a number of his best officers, including Brigadiers Maimalari and Samuel Adesujo Ademulegun, the Commander 1st Brigade Headquarters in Kaduna. Ironsi was full of emotion and even shed some tears. When we asked him about the whereabouts of Sir ABubakar and Chief Okotie-Eboh, he said he still did not know but averred efforts were being made to locate them. At this stage Mbadiwe broke down and kept crying: \"Please where is the Prime Minister?\"\nWhen we reminded Major-General Ironsi if he needed to avail himself of the British pledge of assistance, he replied it was too late as the army was pressing him to assume power. Indeed, he confessed his personal reluctance to take over because of his ignorance of government; but insisted the boys were adamant and anxiously waiting outside. He advised it would be in our interest, and that of the country, to temporarily cede power to him to avert disaster. Accordingly, we acceded to his request since we had no better alternative. Ironsi then insisted that the understanding be written.\nSurprisingly, there was no stationery to write the agreement; and all the offices were locked while no official was around. Alhaji AGF Abdulrazaq the Minister of State for the Railways (former NPC legal adviser), managed to secure a scrap paper on which he drafted a statement, which we endorsed. That was the so called voluntary hand-over of power by the Balewa Government to Major General Ironsi! It was agreed that the statement would be typed and Dipcharima would sign it on our behalf. We were then advised to return home and await further instructions. I only got to break my Ramadan fast around 9:30 pm.\nLater at 11.50 pm, Dr. Orizu made a terse nationwide broadcast, announcing the cabinet's voluntary decision to transfer power to the armed forces. Major General Ironsi then made his own broadcast, accepting the \"invitation\". He suspended certain parts of the constitution; set up a national military government, with the office of military governors in each region; and briefly outlined the policy intentions of his regime. Nigeria's first democratic experiment was effectively over. And although the mutiny had by then practically collapsed, military rule had arrived. It was a fact.\nThe following morning, 17 January, Alhaji Kam Salem, the Deputy Inspector-General of Police (then also doubling for the Inspector-General, Mr. Louis Orok Edet, while on vacation), called at my residence to confide that both the PM and Chief Okotie-Eboh had been confirmed killed. He then hinted that Major General Ironsi was still negotiating with the rebels in Kaduna, led by Major Patrick Chukwuma Kaduna Nzeogwu\"\nThen Lt. Col. (later General) Gowon, who was not physically present when the rump cabinet was handing over, says he was later told by Ironsi and other officers (who were outside the cabinet office chambers, and thus did not themselves witness the event) that it was voluntary. He recalls asking three separate times to be certain, but now says that had he known it was not, he would have acted differently on that day as the Commander of the 2nd Battalion at Ikeja which supported Ironsi in putting down the Ifeajuna-Nzeogwu revolt.\nThe substantive President, Nnamdi Azikiwe, also of eastern origin, had left the country in late 1965 first for Europe, then on a health cruise to the caribbean, after allegedly being tipped off by his cousin, Major Ifeajuna, one of the masterminds of the coup and, some say, overall leader. Interestingly, (assuming reports that he had foreknowledge are true) Azikiwe did not notify his alliance partner, the Prime Minister, Alhaji Tafawa Balewa, with whom he had clashed over control of the armed forces during the Constitutional crisis of January 1965, following the controversial December 1964 federal elections.\nIn fact President Azikiwe's personal physician, Dr. Humphrey Idemudia Idehen, abandoned him abroad when he got tired of the \"health trip\", having run out of his personal estacode allowance, unaware that there may have been a good reason why Azikiwe did not want to return to Nigeria, after their original planned return date in December 1965 passed. Not even the Commonwealth Leaders' Conference hosted for the first time by the country in early January was incentive enough for the President to return, for obvious reasons of protocol. However, after the coup, in a statement to the Press in England on January 16, among other things, Azikiwe did not condemn the coup per se, but said:\n\"Violence has never been an instrument used by us, as founding fathers of the Nigerian Republic, to solve political problems. ….I consider it most unfortunate that our 'Young Turks' decided to introduce the element of violent revolution into Nigerian politics. No matter how they and our general public might have been provoked by obstinate and perhaps grasping politicians, it is an unwise policy……..As far as I am concerned, I regard the killings of our political and military leaders as a national calamity….\nMajor Ifeajuna was later to be accused by Major Patrick Nzeogwu, leader of northern operations, of bungling or ignoring an apparent understanding to assassinate General Ironsi in Lagos - an oversight, or \"misguided consideration\" (to use Nzeogwu's words) that caused the failure of the coup. Indeed, Nzeogwu bluntly declared publicly that the execution of the coup in the South was tribalistic. Captain Emmanuel Nwobosi (rtd), leader of operations in the Western region, has since corroborated the view that operations in Lagos were compromised by nepotism. For this and other reasons, over the years, some analysts have come to view Nzeogwu, who was recruited two full months after the plot was already in progress, as a tool in a plot he never fully understood. Indeed, in offering condolences for the death of the Sardauna of Sokoto, ex-Senate President Nwafor Orizu told Alhaji Shehu Shagari that Major Nzeogwu was \"an unknown entity among the Ibos (sic) in the Eastern region.\"\n4.0 VICTIM OF THE UNKNOWN CONSPIRACY\nWhen the eastern region Governor, Emeka Ojukwu after the counter coup declared the secession of Biafra, the only igbo military voice heard against such secession was from Nzeogwu. Other coupist went mute.\nWhere are the other patriotic national officers ready to lay their lives in a military coup for Nigeria? Their much beloved Nigeria is on the verge of civil war and their voice were no where to be heard. What was the reaction of Okafor, Major Ifeajuna and Captain Oji who initiated the coup when the war almost broke out? Nothing.\nOn the eve of the civil war, Nzeogwu whose eastern region was about to go into a civil war with the rest of the country publicly expressed his opposition to the Biafran declaration in an interview despite knowing the consequence of such expression.\nIn the first place, secession will be ill-advised, indeed impossible. Even if the east fights a war of secession and wins, it still cannot secede.\nNzeogwu stated further that, personally, I don't like secession and if this country disintegrates,I shall pack up my things and go. In the present circumstances, confederation is the best answer as a temporary measure. In time, we shall have complete unity. Nzeogwu said.\nTo further establish the nationalistic nature of this patriotic fellow called Nzeogwu, MAX SIOLLUN quoted Nzeogwu's letter before the war to his friend Olusegun Obasanjo In June 17, 1967 where Nzeogwu confessed:\n“You have no doubt heard a lot of rumours about my relations with Ojukwu. We obviously see things quite differently after what he did to my supporters in January 1966. He is also worried about my popularity among his own people. I was to be put back in prison, but he was afraid of repercussions. Right now I am not allowed contact with troops nor am I permitted to operate on the staff. One gentleman's agreement we have is that I can carry on with what ever pleases me.”\nFrom the tone in this letter, we could see that Nzeogwu see's himself less of an igbo, but more of a Nigerian.\nHe also wrote in the letter:\n“I will create a new Nigerian army inside Biafra!! With Igbo, Hausa, Yoruba and all other ethnic groups.” Nzeogwu wrote.\nEven inside Biafra while the war was abut to begin, Nzeogwu was still committed to building a great Nigeria. What a rare patriot we have lost to internal strife.\nIn an interview with Ejindu in 1967, Nzeogwu was asked that, alot has been talked and written about the January coup. But how tribalistic was it really in conception and execution?\nHe responded thus:\nIn the North, no. In the South, yes.\nHe stated that,\n''we were five in number, and initially we knew quite clearly what we wanted to do. We had a short list of people who were either undesirable for the future progress of the country or who by their positions at the time had to be sacrificed for peace and stability''.\n''Tribal considerations were completely out of our minds at this stage. But we had a set-back in the execution. Both of us in the North did our best. But the other three who were stationed in the South failed because of incompetence and misguided considerations in the eleventh hour''.\n'' The most senior among them was in charge of a whole brigade and had all the excuse and opportunity in the world to mobilize his troops anywhere, anyhow and any time. He did it badly. In Lagos, even allowing for one or two genuine mistakes, the job was badly done''.\n'' The Mid-West was never a big problem.\nBut in the East, our major target, nothing practically was done. He and the others let us down. Nzeogwu said.\nThis above submission by Nzeogwu clearly reveal the conspiracy of what truly happened in the eastern part of the country during the first coup.\nThe explanation by Nzeogwu himself was clear, there was of course tribal consideration by those in the east. In the words of Nzeogwu, ''they let us down, because nothing practically was done''.\nIn this text, Nzeogwu made it clear that in the west, it was probably due to incompetence or misguided considerations, but in the east, certainly, it has nothing to do with incompetence, but nothing was practically done to execute the coup.\nWhile Nzeogwu may be committed to a national exercise, the other igbo co-plotters had other ideas. Here we know, Nzeogwu was victim of unknwon conspiracy.\nWhen Nzeogwue was further asked by Ejindu: It has been said that Gen. Ironsi set out to complete your job for you. Was there anything you did not like in his administration?\nNzeogwu replied: Yes, everything. First he chose the wrong advisers for the work he halfheartedly set out to do. Most of them were either mediocre or absolutely unintelligent.\nSecondly, he was tribalistic in the appointment of his governors. Thirdly the Decree 34 was unnecessary, even silly in fact.\nWith the above submission both by Nzeogwu and other events that followed the coup, it was obvious that there was indeed a conspiracy, which Nzeogwu happens to be a victim.\nThe decree 34 gave Nigeria's federal status a setback in 1966 when the then Military government promulgated the Constitution (Suspension and Modification) Decree No. 34 of 1966. Section 1 of the Decree stated that, as from May 24th 1966, Nigeria would cease to be a federation and would be known as the Republic of Nigeria.\nThe decree 34 made far-reaching changes in the political structure of the country and converted it to a unitary sate. The government at the Centre was named the National Military Government while regions were called groups of provinces.Professor Justus A. S,Dr. Ifidon O,Mr. Ige A, and Miss Omotayo O ''Constitutional law 1''.\nCommenting on this Decree, the eminent jurist, Dr. T. O. Elias said: “It would seem that by this Decree, a unitary form of government had been established for Nigeria. The Federation itself was abolished as were the regions as such.”\nProfessor J.D. Ojo also said, “This Decree that was promulgated without taking into consideration the heterogeneous nature of the society was to say the least, an exercise in futility”.\n4.1 VICTIM OF ETHNIC SENTIMENT\nWhen one take a look at the social media, particularly nairaland.com or facebook where young people have access to interract with each other on a daily basis, you see how young people as young as 20 years of age indulge in insulting each other in defence of certain views or opinion particularly on the civil war. These youths who were not yet human when the war took place now see themselves as experts on the civil issue and speak about what they were told with confidence as if they actively participated in the war. Infact, some of them go as far as seeing their fellow youths from across the divide as war enemy that must be annihilated. They promote hate, illogicality and advance the course of sentimentalism that brought about the war in the first place. These are people that i refer to as victims of ethnic sentiments.\nWhile growing up, these young victims of ethnic sentiments grow up to hear what their parents are saying about the civil war or read about what their ethnic people wrote about it. It doesn't matter if what they wrote was true or not, what mattered was that, those who they look up to as mentors, parents, leaders and others have spoken and they cannot be wrong or questioned since they fought and later surrendered to save future generations.\nSome concerned observers of the ugly trend have been wondering how these young people develop such negative attitudes towards issues of national concern, but we must not forget the effect of socialization and upbringing which tutor children and instill certain believe in them.\nHow can a child disbelieve what his parents say about a war in which they suffered greatly? How can he or she disbelieve a story that corrobated what his parents had said about the war, writen by his ethnic adored writer who articulated such story in a widely circulated book outlet? How will he disbelieve a story told by people who nurtured, feed and educated him from childhood? Ofcourse, he can hardly have a different view and even if he did, he his less likely to express such to avoid being seen as opposite to the feelings of majority of his ethnic people. Very few individual can summon the courage to think outside the box and open their mind to the variety of facts to determine truth rather than hold unto myth.These young people have been indoctrinated to hate from childhood,their mind had been shot to objectivity and they hardly reason with logicality.\nWe have now getting to a stage that, instead of seeking to enlist the support of fellows youths towards developmental accomplishments, youths focus on ethnic superiority. They ignorantly create enemy from nowhere and focus on attacking each other for what none of them can actually confirm its genuinity since they were not present during its occurrence.\nWe must make concerted effort to reverse this ugly situation to avoid future catastrophe.\n5.0 WHAT THEY SAY ABOUT NZEOGWU\nDespite killing the most revered political leadership of the northern Nigeria during the coup, those who knew Nzeogwu including the northern officersstill hold that, he was a patriotic officer who did what he did out of patriotism\nAfter his death, the Nigerian soldiers that found his corpse cried most of whom were of Northern origin. This lay credence that he was dragged to the battle front by the Biafrian authorities.\nMajor General Yakubu Gowon, the then head of state referred to Nzeogwu as a detribalized Nigeria and most Nigerians who know him share that view.\nAccording to Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo ''Nzeogwu was \"both a Nigerian & Pan-Africanist\", \"a kind-hearted, open and generous man, who believed that there should be no dividing line on any basis between Nigerians in one part of the country and those in other parts.\" \"He detested injustice and arrogance...\nChukwuma had a dream of a great Nigeria that is a force to be reckon with in the world, not through ineffective political rhetoric but through purposeful & effective action...He had a dream of an ordered and orderly nation, through a disciplined society. He also dreamt of a country where national interest over-rides self, sectional or tribal interest... He had a dream of a country free of graft and greed\" Obasanjo said.\nMaj-Gen. Olufemi Olutoye who was once Nzeogwu's instructor also said, there was no doubt he had traces of eccentricity but he was a very good person.\nHe was very kind and truthful. When he had a point and was convinced, he would stick to it. That was one policy he had.\nGeneral Domkat Bali, one of the key participants in the civil war noted that, '' we believed that he (Nzeogwu) was a genuinely patriotic officer who organized the 1966 coup with the best of intentions who was let down by his collaborators…if we had captured him alive, he would not have been killed. I believe he probably would have been tried for his role in the January 15 coup, jailed and probably freed after some time. His death was regrettable.” Domkat Bali said.\nWhile it may not be completely proven that there indeed exist a conspiracy, I believe the time line of events and actions of key players in the coup as clearly established in the above submission shows the possibility of a conspiracy.\nBut irrespective of what happened during the early days of Nigeria, we must learn from the past and move forward. Accusation and counter accusation is not the best way to heal past wounds, it can never be a way to re-write the wrong of yesterday, rather, it fuels hatred and suspicion. Therefore, all Nigerians irrespective of region or tribe must agree that, those who represented us in the past had committed some error and we must never allow it to repeat itself. 70% of people living today in each region have nothing to do with yesterday's error, greed and conspiracy. They have nothing to do with the mockery of northern region, neither do they participate in the pogrom of the easterners.\nIf we all relate with each other with respect, truth and sincerity, there won't be any reason to remember past mistakes.\nNigerian civil war history http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigerian_Civil_War\nChukwuma Kaduna Nzeogwu profile http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chukwuma_Kaduna_Nzeogwu\nThe Inside Story Of Nigeria's First Military Coup part 1. http://www.nigeriansinamerica.com/articles/781/3/The-Inside-Story-Of-Nigerias-First-Military-Coup-I/Page3.html\nThe Inside Story Of Nigeria's First Military Coup part 2. http://www.nigeriansinamerica.com/articles/1376/1/The-Inside-Story-Of-Nigerias-First-Military-Coup-2/Page1.html\nInterview with Major Nzeogwu. http://maxsiollun.wordpress.com/2008/02/20/interview-with-major-nzeogwu/\nPolice report of january 1966 coup. http://www.waado.org/nigerdelta/nigeria_facts/MilitaryRule/Omoigui/1966Coup-Part1.html\nMajor Nzeogwu's Anti-corruption Coup Speech http://www.igbofocus.co.uk/Nzeogwu-s_Declaration_of_Marti/nzeogwu-s_declaration_of_martial_law_-_january_15-_1966.html\nThe 1966 Intervention of Major Patrick Chukwuma Kaduna Nzeogwu http://www.searchlightnigeria.com/2014/01/the-1966-intervention-of-major-patrick.html\nThough I begged Major Nzeogwu not to stage 1966 coup, he ignored me –Gen.

The Minister of State for Petroleum, Mr. Ibe Kachikwu had made public declaration concerning the PMS price hike to N145, asserting that it is the best for the nation.\n“But the truth is that Mr. Kachikwu’s verbal utterance is a pronouncement of economic malady in disguise to the nation. President Buhari who claims to be the senior Minister of Petroleum has outrightly jettisoned the tenets of democracy by this singular act of his, haven failed to consult relevant stakeholders before the hike”.\nChibuzo in the statement, said “we had advised the President to abdicate his acclaimed position as the Minister of Petroleum”, pointing out that “it would spell disaster on the nation’s economy and here we are as we have been vindicated.\n“Contrarily to this demand the President have remained obdurate and tactically recalcitrant to our demands. It is conspicuously clear that the Minister of State Petroleum , Mr. Kachikwu is only working in line with the President’s directives. And it becomes bizarre to understand why a President who had no knowledge of the downstream sector is being deputized by a more knowledgeable and sophisticated man in the field, coupled with other state engagement of Mr. President.\n“The hike in price of the PMS has affected students in our various campuses negatively, where they are now forced to pay more for intra and inter campus transportation fare. Those who travel from far and near to campuses , have also been subjected more to this social catastrophe. Price of goods and services have skyrocketed to an unimaginable proportion.\n“The timing no doubt has also aggravated the effects of the hike. It is an aberration to increase the price of PMS when the economy presently hangs on an abysmal economic pendulum of glaring adverse effect. Nigerian students under the aegis of NANS Zone B say no to hike in PMS price, hence we demand immediate reversal of the PMS price to N86. Anything short of this will attract the burning wrath of the Nigerian Students in South South and South East Regional block of Nigeria.\n“This we are not sure the Federal Government would be able to quell when it finally comes up.\nStrategic mobilization has began across various campuses for the total showdown, if our demand is neglected. The government must learn to respect and consider students welfare before taking certain decisions with far reaching negative effects such as this, as many of our campuses are already closed down as a result of the Federal Government’s insensitivity to the Education sector and general students welfare.\n“If our Demands are not considered and an immediate reversal is not achieved within the shortest possible time, we will alongside Nigerian Labour Congress (NLC), Trade Union Congress (TUC) and other civil society organisations, occupy and shutdown all federal parastatals and campuses across the eleven States of South South and South East Nigeria.\n“We reiterate, that this decision by the President is inhumane, callous, vile and tyrannical in all respects. It is a fact that the President neglected the students body when taking the decision, and this also has amassed our grievances for the Federal Government.\n“That which happened in 2012 when former President Goodluck Jonathan removed subsidy from PMS would not only happen again, but would be doubled this time around. Unilaterally fixing PMS price has once again brought to fore the dictatorial attributes of President Buhari, as the PPPRA board, which is the board saddled with fixing PMS price is yet to be reconstituted, therefore whatever price being brandished by Federal Government is null and void and we reject same in its entirety.\n“We therefore call on the Nigerian people to rise up to their responsibilities as this government has shown time without number that they don’t mean well for the masses. This government has continued to swim from one economic blunder to the other, dishing out anti masses policies on daily basis.\n“This government has been thriving on propaganda and lies, with Minister of State Petroleum stating that subsidy on PMS has been removed while the Vice President; Prof. Yemi Osinbajo is countering same by saying No Subsidy was removed. Which one do Nigerian masses believe, a government of confusion”.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"http://www.vanguardngr.com/2016/05/pms-price-hike-students-avow-shutting-down-govt-institutions-in-ssouth-seast/","2":"1162","3":"Politics","4":"0","5":"en","6":"0.9999809265"},{"0":"By Abbas Bamalli/Katsina\nThe Katsina State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA) said two persons died in floods that destroyed over 1,500 houses in the aftermath of heavy rainfall in three Local Government Areas.\nAlhaji Umar Mohammed, the Public Relations Officer (PRO) of the agency said over 800 houses were affected in Faskari, 400 in Bindawa and 300 in Sabuwa Local Government Areas (LGAs).\nThe two deaths recorded happened in Bindawa LGA, where the heavy rain lasted almost five hours.\nMohammed said the agency was already looking at how to assist the victims.\nThe heavy rain started at about 10 a.m on Monday and stopped at about 4 p.m..\nIt forced many motorists to abandon their vehicles.\nSome of the residents of Katsina metropolis who spoke to NAN expressed worry over the flooding of some major streets due to the heavy downpour.\nMany motorists driving along Kofar Kaura roundabout and some parts of the layout area of the metropolis were able to divert by using a single lane of the road to their various destinations.\nOne of the motorists, Malam Muhammad Safana, described the situation as worrisome, saying that it could worsen if the heavy rains continued.\n“As you have seen, the rain has caused flooding, which filled some major roads in the city, looking for a route to pass, and also some houses were affected.\n“As I was passing through the Tudun Katsira layout, some buildings were also affected due to the lack of proper drainage in the areas.

Oshiomhole also lampooned the Federal government austerity measures due to fallen prices oil, querying that “ what did they do with our money when oil was N108 per barrel. They said we should tighten our belt but they gave us no belt, that is anti people”.\nThe Governor declare this at the traditional Urhokpota Ground Ring Road Benin City, where he received the former Minister of State for Works and PDP Chieftain, Engr. Chris Ogiemwonyi and over two thousand of his supporters into the APC. About 20 palace chiefs led by Chief Jackson Igbinoba, and different PDP groups one of them led by Chief Arala Osula, dumped the party for the APC.\nOgiemwonyi said he decided to dump the PDP after what he described as the failure of the PDP to fix both the economic, security and other problems bedevilling the nation. He added that Governor Oshiomhole’s developmental strides in Edo state and the achievement of other APC governors convinced him that APC means well for the Edo people and Nigerians in general.\nOshiomhole who received the decampees into the party gave reasons why Nigerians must vote the PDP led Federal government out. His words, “What is buried in the name of PDP can never resurrect because the Bible says, he who die in sin shall perish and languish in hell. And because PDP died in sin, they killed, they embezzled our money, they dehumanized our people, they enveloped Benin with flood, converted our young one to prostitution and reduced Edo from the heart beat to a part of the country that was now remember only by reference to very negative headlines.\n“ It will take PDP more than a hundred years to pay reparation to Edo people. If anybody imagine what has happened in this state for six years, then you can better calculate how much they stole from the treasury of this state and how many miles they set up backwards in terms of where were are supposed to be. And that is why when the President came here to say that Edo will fall, I said well who is speaking. Can a man who is on the ground speak to a man who is on his feet?\n“ PDP has already been fallen and buried in Edo state many many years ago. Yes in the last election we asked our people to vote on the basic of certain sentiments, and the PDP at the Presidential level won 95 per cent of the votes. But now Edo people are asking, what do we have to show for it. The erosion caused by PDP at Queen Ede has destroyed the schools built for Edo child. That erosion is destroying the Catholic Church, it has destroyed several houses, killed many of our people.\n“ Federal PDP shared money to PDP states including states where the President lost election, they did not give one dim to the people of Edo state. Our crime because we voted wrongly. In Auchi, erosion have swept away more then 50 per cent of the houses and swept away others, they shared the ecology money they gave no dim to the people of Auchi. In Esan Central and West, erosion has destroyed a number of communities, PDP produced leaders in Esan land they did not bring one dime to deal with erosion in Esan land, but they gave money to Delta, they gave money to Bayelsa, they gave money to Cross River, they gave money to Niger, Jigawa, Kaduna and others.\n“ What is our offence because we voted wrongly? So when we say APC, Change PDP, Change Jonathan it is informed by evidence. We must change both the party and the driver. PDP has failed for sixteen years they should leave.\n“And let me be very specific, if we had not removed PDP in Edo we wold not have experienced the change we are seeing today in Edo. If we remove PDP from Abuja the way we removed them from Edo we will have power, universities will not be closing for six months, they will not be distributing SURE-P through PDP leaders, they will not be devaluing the currency and they will not be acting like small gods” he asserted.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"http://www.vanguardngr.com/2014/11/jonathans-administration-must-go-oshiomhole/#sthash.t3ChZggQ.dpufThe","2":"1053","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999885559"},{"0":"By Udeme Akpan\nTHE price of petrol has been increased to N151.56 per litre, according to Pipelines and Product Marketing Company (PPMC), a subsidiary of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, NNPC.\nIn a statement obtained by Vanguard, D.O Abalaka of the PPMC, stated: “Please be informed that a new product price adjustment has been effected on our payment platform.\n“To this end, the price of Premium Motor Spirit (PMS) is now one hundred and fifty-one naira, fifty-six kobo (N151.56k) per litre.”\nHe added: “This takes effect from September 2, 2020.”\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"https://www.vanguardngr.com/2020/09/breaking-petrol-price-now-n151-56-per-litre-%e2%80%95-ppmc/amp/","2":"171","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999160767"},{"0":"The Minister of Aviation and Aerospace Development Festus Keyamo has faulted the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) and Trade Union Congress (TUC) protest at the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport in Abuja.\nLabour had early this morning blockaded the airport owing to its faceoff with the Imo State government after the president of the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) Joe Ajaero was beaten up in the South-East state.\nThe move grounded activities at the airport, leaving many travellers grounded.\nBut speaking at an aviation retreat for the Honourable Minister, Permanent Secretary, Directors and Head of Agencies of the Aviation Ministry, in Effurun on Thursday, Keyamo faulted the move and questioned why the unions targeted the sector that was not involved in the maltreatment of the NLC chairman.\n“Aviation was not involved at all.

Bomb scare at the state secretariat of the All Progressives Congress (APC). This happened at a time stalwarts had gathered at the secretariat preparatory to the Obokun-Oriade federal constituency mega rally at Ibokun, the headquarters of Obokun local government area, some 30 kilometres away.\nSome people were alleged to have thrown some substances believed to be explosives from behind the fence. Those who reportedly saw them alerted the party chieftains. Panic ensued. The police were called in. The entire premises combed. No explosive substances found. Two suspects were arrested. The police took them away in their pick up van.\nMany of the APC stalwarts concluded that law enforcement by the police in the August 8 gubernatorial election that has raised so much tension in Osun State would make a lot of difference if the promptness with which the police responded to distress call on this particular occasion is sustained. They added that law enforcement in the poll in which the state government, Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola, is the APC candidate and a leading contender, must also be seen to be carried out in an important manner.\nThe tensed atmosphere in the wake of the bomb scare at the APC secretariat and arrest of suspects soon gave way to relief. In less than one hour later, the party train took off for Ibokun. The APC stalwarts, comprising of men and women, old and young, wielding brooms of different colours, were resplendent in purple uniform. They were met at different points from some 10 kilometres to the rally ground by groups of party supporters, singing, dancing, wielding their brooms, and shouting APC slogans.\nThe atmosphere at the rally group L.A. Primary School, Ibokun was a different ballgame altogether. Billboards announcing Aregbesola’s second term ambition and his achievements of the last three and a half years stood at strategic points. The crowd was impressive. There were all categories of people, many of them dressed in the APC’s purple uniform while others were Aregbesola’s supporters group’s T-shirt, bearing the portrait of the governor. School children, wearing their school uniforms, were not left out of the occasion.\nThe Osun APC Director of Publicity, Barrister Kunle Oyatomi, described the crowd thus: Some critics said we have been renting crowds to attend Governor Aregbesola’s rally. I am sure you will agree with me that you cannot rend this kind of crowd. The crowd, as you can see, is representative of all categories of people in this constituency (Obokun-Oriade), and the fact that they have come to see the governor campaign at their ally shows that they appreciate his good works of the past three and a half years. I make bold to say that the Ogbeni’s good works will speak for him at the August 9 election. We are sure to win the election.\nIndeed, the tumultuous crowd at the rally could have been a question of what Aregbesola’s loyalists see as his ‘sterling performance’ since his tenure started in 2010 which, according to them, has endeared him to the Osun people, and for which he should be re-elected. The loyalists readily point to the Aregbesola’s education policy which they believe has transformed the state and is on the way to putting Osun on a pedestal to compete with other states across the country.\n”The school children in this locality have no reason not to be here & if not to appreciate Ogbeni Aregbesola for all he has done to ensure that learning in schools is carried out without tears”, the interim chairman of the Osun APC, Elder Adelowo Adebiyi, told Sunday Vanguard at the rally ground. Under the Osun education policy, one of the six-point integral action plan of the Aregbesola administration, entitled, ‘Promotion of functional education’, decayed infrastructure is being replaced and there is quality control.\nOther legs of the action plan are banishment of hunger/unemployment, enhanced security/welfare, restoration of healthy living and promotion of communal peace. Under the education policy school children up to primary four are being fed in school. One of the key points of the policy is re-classification into elementary school (5 years), middle school (4 years) and high school (3 years), as against the national education policy of 6-3-3. The Osun education system gives the pupil more time at the middle school which the initiators believe he needs to prepare him for maturity into high school.\nThe education policy with its attendant mega schools to accommodate many small schools brought children from different religious backgrounds under the same room to learn soon sparked controversy. Critics interpreted it to mean the erasure of religious lines especially in schools with bias for religion. The policy was resisted in at least one school before the fire was doused. Oyatomi, the Osun APC image maker, said the crisis was politically motivated.\nHis words: The policy was fashioned out by a team of educationists led by Professor Wole Soyinka to revive the education sector which was practically dead before Governor Aregbesola came into office. Unfortunately, some people tried to politicise it by saying it is anti-Christianity. Nothing could be far from the truth. We have only brought together children of diverse backgrounds to learn under the same roof and conducive atmosphere unlike the former situation where schools were more of pig sties. This administration built no fewer than 25 mega schools for this purpose.\nOyatomi spoke further: School children up to primary four also eat one nutritious meal at school every school day to help their brains develop properly and build a better state in future. According to him, the feeding programme has multiplier effects in Osun as it empowers farmers who supply the schools with the food items. The APC spokesman also spoke on the Opon Imo, tablet of knowledge, distributed to pupils across Osun. The tablet, with 56 e-books, visual training and 10 years past questions, in addition to the Bible, the Quran and traditional religion content, also saves the government huge sums that could have been spent buying books under the free education programme, year in, year out.\nOn the alleged involvement of Aregbesola’s son in the Opon Imo project, the APC spokesman said the son, being a software expert, merely introduced it to government, challenging anybody who has the facts that he (Aregbesola’s son) benefitted financially to make them public.\nOyatomi also described as nonsense the allegation that the state government brought to Osun a school uniform making project for which a huge sum was paid, and, in the process, denying local tailors business. According to him, government facilitated the project to relocate to Osun on the condition that it will employ local hands, thereby creating job opportunities for the people.\nParents are also beneficiaries of the new dispensation on Osun education as they now spend less to educate their children. Even if the parents did not come to the Aregbesola rally for this reason, they possibly had many others bordering on the governor’s achievements in many other sectors.\nThe sectors include agriculture where farmers have access to soft loans and good roads to transport their produce to the market; health where new hospitals are being built and old ones renovated in addition to free health treatment for a section of the people; aggressive infrastructural development which has seen roads rehabilitated and new ones built; youth empowerment which takes care of unemployed youths; the empowerment of security agencies to ensure peace and stop criminality; and ‘robust management’ of the state economy.\nOyatomi was particular about the Osun governor’s achievements in the road sector where, according to him, Aregbesola is bringing to bear his ingenuity as an engineer. Durable roads, the APC spokesman stated, are being built all over Osun. The novel aspect of road construction in the state is that roads are delivered before contractors are paid. This ensures that jobs are done to specifications and are not abandoned. Oyatomi dismissed critics claim that the Osun governor is a religious bigot fighting Christians.\nTo justify his position, the APC spokesman explained: Although the governor is a devout Muslim, and he does not hide it, his cabinet is dominated by Christians. Of the 34 members in the cabinet, 22 are Christians and 12 Muslims. And of the 32 permanent secretaries in the state, 20 are Christians. In the House of Assembly, made up of 26 members, only nine are Muslims. All these are apart from his policies devoid of religious sentiments.\nSo, how do you sustain the unfair tag that the governor is a religious bigot? On the state’s economy, Oyatomi said the state administration has managed it from the point of near bankruptcy when it assumed office to the point that it is now sustainable.\nOur greatest challenge now is that government allocation from the federation account has dropped from about N5 billion every month to about N2.5 billion. This is augmented with about N1.6 billion monthly IGR which government upped from N300 million when it came in. But the downsize of it is that we have workers salary / pension of N3.6 billion monthly to pay. It is a dicey situation, but the statement government has made over time is that we have the capacity to manage the Osun economy.\nThe spokesman pointed out that sourced for N10 billion Sukuk bond that was over subscribed to N11 billion, and another N60 billion bond, out of which N30 billion had been drawn. The over-subscription of the Sukuk bond, according to Oyatomi, told the story of the investors confidence in the Osun economy under Aregbesola.\nAll considered, the Aregbesola administration has a testimonial that justifies re-election, Oyatomi added.\nThe Osun governor arrived the Obokun-Oriade constituency mega rally to a tumultuous welcome. Defying the rain that had threatened before he came, he immediately mounted the rostrum to address the crowd which had waited patiently since 10 am.\nAregbesola burst into song: Let the rain fall to drench us. After all we own our clothes. He warned the opposition in the August 9 poll against dividing the Osun people along religious lines as it would have grave consequences.

The total transfer time can then be anywhere from 48 hours to 7 days.\nBrandBucket has vetted and supports the following registrars:\n- Google Domains\n- Amazon Route 53\n- 123 Reg\n2.

The domain will be transferred from the seller to a BrandBucket escrow account, ensuring a secure hold on the domain during the lease term. We will transfer the domain to you once all payments are complete.\nDuring the lease, you're entitled to use the domain name for your website and email; your agent will guide you through that.\nEach month you will continue to receive an invoice with a balance statement. You have the right to cancel the lease any time or complete all payments early to own the domain outright.\nEstablished in 2007, we are the original business name marketplace. Every year, we sell 1000s of premium domains to entrepreneurs and businesses like you.\nAll of our domain names are handpicked by branding and linguistics experts based on rigorous criteria. You can rest assured that if a domain is on the BrandBucket marketplace, it is a top-tier business name.\nAlmost one out of every four names sold on BrandBucket is sold to a repeat buyer or a referral, which means that people who buy from us once, keep coming back for more.\nThe .com extension is a brand in itself. As the default domain extension of the internet, having a .com domain that is an exact match to your brand name has numerous advantages:\n- Familiarity - People are familiar with .com. Most of the brands and websites they already trust, use the .com extension. Therefore, it serves as a subtle indicator that your business is a legitimate one. A recent study by the NCC Group, a global expert in cybersecurity and risk mitigation, found that roughly half of the consumers are uncomfortable visiting websites ending with a non .com extension, and only 9% are comfortable doing so.\n- Brand Protection - When you own the .com version of a domain name, you have the official online version of that name. Owning an exact-match .com can protect your brand name, as it is unlikely another serious business would use the same name when the .com extension is taken.\n- Easy to Communicate - .com domains are also easy to communicate. When people hear or see your business name without a TLD, they will inevitably assume it ends in .com, making it easy for them to find you online.\nOnce you have received the name into your registrar account, you will be able to:\n- Use the domain as your website address.\n- Setup email addresses, for instance, email@example.com.\n- Use the domain and logo on business cards and other materials.\nIf you don’t have a website built yet, you can put up a simple coming soon page, or you can just leave it until you are ready. You don’t need to do anything right away. Because you own the domain name, you can take your time.\nOur talented community of logo designers designs all logos on the BrandBucket marketplace. They are paid for their efforts, and BrandBucket owns all copyrights for the logos. We will transfer the full copyright for the logo to you upon purchase of the domain name.\nLogo files are delivered to you in the following formats:\n- High-resolution image file (PNG)\n- Editable vector file (.AI)\nEditing your design\nVector (AI) files are entirely editable in programs such as photoshop and illustrator, so you or your designer can make desired changes. If needed, we can make basic color changes/small tweaks to the logo for you after purchase. If you are looking for a complete redesign, we can connect you with a designer from our talented design community at their discretion and price.\nAll of our business domains are carefully chosen for their standout branding qualities. There is only one uhuh.com. However, there may well be other businesses that are using the same brand name. In fact, with common keyword names, it is likely. That is why owning the .com is so essential. In holding the .com, you immediately establish your business as the most official version of that name. It's unlikely any serious business is going to use a brand name where the .com domain is already in use. Many companies believe that owning the matching .com version of a business name provides more protection for their brand than a trademark.\nNo, and it’s not possible for us to do so. Trademarks are industry and region-specific, and to file a trademark for a name or logo, you must already be doing business as that name. Because of this, we can't trademark a name before your company is actively using it. Therefore, you will need to apply for trademark registration after you have purchased the name.\nWhen you purchase a domain from BrandBucket, you will own it 100%. However, all domain names worldwide must be kept registered at a registrar like Godaddy or similar that you choose. You will pay the registration fees to whichever registrar you decide to use. The price of registration varies at each registrar, but it generally ends up being around $10-15 per year for a .com domain name. Registration is annual but can be paid up for years in advance, which we suggest you do.\nBrandBucket serves as a third-party marketplace and escrow agent for domain names. We only offer refunds if either of these two conditions are met:\n- The buyer contacts us within 24 hours of purchase requesting a refund.\n- The seller fails to initiate the domain name transfer within 10 business days from the time of purchase.\nBuyers are advised to perform all necessary diligence prior to making a purchase.\nYour purchase is 100% confidential. Any personal information you share with BrandBucket is kept private, even from the domain seller. We never publicize any sale on our marketplace.\nA brand name is a name that you use to identify a family of products, services, or a single line of products or services that a company offers. For instance, Apple is the brand name used on most products manufactured by Apple, Inc. In this example, the business name and brand name are the same, a common use case.\nYour brand name is who you are to your customers. It is the pillar your business's public image will be built around. The products or services you offer can also have their own brand names. You may want to create new brand names for products or services that differ from your core business offering, for example:\n- UberEats - Food delivery by Uber\n- Amazon Web Services - Cloud computing from Amazon\n- Google Maps - Web mapping service from Google\nRegistered Business Name\nA business name is the legally registered name of your business. You'll use your business name to create contracts, open bank accounts, pay taxes, and any other administrative related activities. Most business names contain the business's brand name, followed by the company's chosen business structure, for example:\n- Walmart Inc.\n- Verizon Inc.\n- Grasshopper LLC\nHowever, they don't necessarily have to be the same. In some cases, the business name is completely different from the brand name. This is most common in large businesses that have multiple brands housed under a single parent company, for example:\n- Brand Name: Google\n- Business Name: Alphabet Inc.\n- Brand Name: MailChimp\n- Business Name: The Rocket Science Group LLC\nA domain name is your website name - the internet address where people can access your website. Think of a domain as the address to the online version of your business. Every domain is one-of-a-kind. No website has the same web address as another website.\nIdeally, your domain name should be an exact match to your brand name. Think of your favorite companies. Odds are, their domain name is identical to their brand name. Apple's domain name is Apple.com; Amazon's domain name is Amazon.com. Having a matching domain ensures that people can easily find your brand online.\nWhat can a top brand name with a matching .com do for your business? Here are few of the many advantages of owning a premium business domain:\nTrust - Online, there are subtle clues that all of us subconsciously take into consideration to determine whether or not a business is legitimate and trustworthy. Having a great business name paired with a matching .com (by far the most trusted domain extension) signals to customers that you care about and are willing to invest in your brand. It makes your business and your brand messaging easier to trust.\nAuthority - Owning a .com version of a fantastic brand name is a big signal to the world that your business means business, right out of the gate. This can lead to accelerated customer acquisition, more industry partnership opportunities, and press attention.\nSEO - Having a business domain that matches what customers are using in searches can lead to increased SEO, higher page ranking, and better quality traffic.\nRetention - Brand retention is critical for organically acquiring and keeping customers. A short, catchy, and unique business name makes your brand easier to remember, and having a matching .com means that consumers who hear about you offline will find you easily online.\nSave on marketing spend - Investing in a premium domain can save you a fortune in marketing spend down the line. You'll spend less of your valuable marketing budget and efforts on brand awareness, as your name will do much of the work for you.\nOur customers are primarily entrepreneurs looking for a quick and easy way to find a great brand name for their company. That's why when evaluating and appraising domain names, our central focus is whether they would also make great business names.\nWhat makes a great brand name? Here are some of the branding and linguistic traits we take into consideration:\n- Length - Great names are concise and to the point. The shorter, the better!\n- Common phrase/expression - Names that are based on real phrases and expressions make great brand names because of their built-in familiarity and inherent catchiness.\n- Letter order - Some letters are more valuable than others and better together, especially when it comes to the first letters of a name.\n- Pronunciation and spelling - Names should be easy to say and understand. It should also be spelled as it sounds.\n- Industry match - Names should be a good fit for a particular industry, or be broad enough to attract buyers from multiple sectors.\n- Longevity - Great brand names are broad enough in scope to grow with a company as it expands and not die when trends fade.\n- Uniqueness - Great brand names are easy to spot because they stand out in a crowd.\n- Memorability - A brand name is no good unless people can easily remember it.\nThese criteria, along with historical sales data and current marketplace conditions, are used to determine whether a name is accepted to our marketplace, and how it's priced. Every name on our marketplace must score high in most or all of these categories to even be accepted. With an acceptance rate of only 10% of names submitted to our marketplace, BrandBucket sets a very high bar for the names we select.\nCustomers Also Loved\nThe following are business names for sale with similar qualities to uhuh.com","1":"http://www.uhuh.com/unreal/moncur.htm","2":"2974","3":"Religion","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999885559"},{"0":"The narrow gauge train travelling from Lagos to Kano derailed at Farin Ruwa, near Jaji in Igabi Local Government Area of Kaduna State, killing the train driver in the process.\nMalam Abdullahi Alhaji, Public Relations Officer, Northern Regional District of the Nigeria Railways Corporation (NRC), Zaria, confirmed the incident to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Zaria on Thursday.\nAccording to Alhaji, Bala Kawu, the driver of the train, died during the incident as the cargo train was conveying soft drinks to Kano.\nHe said the incident happened as a result of vandalization of the slippers and other accessories of the rail track in the area.\nAlhaji said rescue efforts are currently ongoing to recover the remains of the deceased to salvage the situation for the train to continue its journey to Kano.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"https://www.vanguardngr.com/2022/03/one-dies-as-lagos-kano-train-derails-in-kaduna/","2":"199","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.999330759"},{"0":"The chief pastor of the worldwide Catholic Church, Pope Francis has asked everyone to \"pray to the Lord for Nigeria, so that every form of violence might always be avoided\".\nAllNews reports that the West African nation has been engulfed by two weeks of massive protests against the government’s Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS), which were sparked by a video depicting a man being shot by SARS officers in Ughelli, Delta State.\nSARS has long been accused of carrying out harassment, extortion, torture, and murder.\nThe demonstrations, conducted under the banner #EndSARS, led the Nigerian government to dissolve the controversial police unit.\nHowever, the demonstrations have persisted and turned violent as protesters demand broader changes to policing and overall, good governance.\nAmid the unrest in major parts of Nigeria, Pope Francis took to his verified Twitter handle on Sunday to enjoin people to uphold values of social harmony.\nLet us pray to the Lord for Nigeria, so that every form of violence might always be avoided, in the constant search of social harmony through the promotion of justice and the common good.\n— Pope Francis (@Pontifex) October 25, 2020\nSince the protests began, estimates are that at least 100 individuals have lost their lives; 48 of whom were killed on 'Black Tuesday' alone.\nBlack Tuesday is the latest in a long history of police and military campaigns in Nigeria against the civilian population.","1":"https://allnews.ng/news/nigeria-unrest-what-pope-asked-each-person-to-do","2":"292","3":"Religion","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999237061"},{"0":"One of the ponzi schemes in Nigeria, Ultimate Cycler has crashed, sending panic waves across many of its Nigerian members who have invested their money in it as well as those who have equally invested in others such as MMM.\nThe ponzi website, Ultimate Cycler went down early Thursday morning, specifically around 10:30am(Nigerian time), shutting out every member who owns an account with it.\nWhen accessed, the site initially displayed an error line of code, before displaying ”Error 500” in bold letters, then it proceeded to display another message: “Be right back.

Anya, Young Progressive Party, YPP, presidential candidate, Prof. Kingsley Moghalu among others.\nSoyinka, in his presentation, upbraided the administration’s failure to obey court orders particularly on the cases involving Shi’ite leader, Ibrahim El-Zakzakky and erstwhile National Security Adviser, NSA, Col. Sambo Dasuki (retd).\nHis words: “Forgiveness is a virtue. Although, I have the same temperament with my late friend, Tai Solarin, but it is a national embarrassment that our President has refused to obey laws. Citizens should not be the one to choose the laws to obey.\n“We want the government to understand that they are part of the community and have been given a mission of carrying out the will of the people. When we talk about governance, we are talking about an instrument for the execution of people’s policy. Insecurity has reached a certain level that even when we bring experts in they wonder what exactly they have come to do. They are given a certain problem to solve, and when they arrived here they meet another problem.\n“One way of stopping the bloodbath is to reconfigure the nation. States must be given maximum control over their resources. There are some, who prefer to grow rice, there are others who prefer to grow religion and we know where religion has taken us today.\nSome people will like to say, it is not really religion that has gotten us to where we are, I agree with you; but some people have manipulated religion to suit their purpose. The effect of those who manipulated it is disastrous. If some people prefer to grow rice, and others to grow Sharia, then, both sides should be given the means to develop.\n“Those insisting on restructuring do so because they know that there is something wrong with the state of Nigeria. Many times, Nigerians have come together to proffer solutions and the way forward for the country, but after spending so much time and effort, nothing ever comes out of it. The recommendations are left to gather dust. How much longer shall we continue like this?”\nNwachukwu canvasses return to old regions\nNwachukwu, who was the chairman of the occasion, cautioned that Nigeria could only reap the benefits of its potentials through a return to the old regions.\nNwachukwu said: “As we prepare for the elections, it is pertinent to remind members of the INEC that theirs is a sacred trust. Though appointed by the government, they are responsible to the people of Nigeria. To make INEC truly independent, there is the need to review the system of appointing its members.”\nNwodo chides opponents of restructuring\nOhanaeze President, Chief Nwodo, in his speech, said: “Those campaigning against restructuring in Nigeria have painted an unfortunate and untrue picture that those of us in support of restructuring are doing so in order to deny the northern states, who have not yet any proven oil reserves of the ability to survive. This is unfortunate. The new model we propose for Nigeria recognizes that revenue in the world today is promoted by two main sources namely, human capital development leveraging on technology to drive the critical sectors of the economy and agriculture.\n“Nigeria beyond oil must contemplate the implementation of legislative independence to the federating units, sovereignty of mineral and oil resources to the federating units, a painstaking resolve to support all electoral processes and candidates that would bring about this change.”\nAdebanjo harps on restructuring\nA chieftain of the Yoruba socio-cultural organisation, Afenifere, Chief Adebanjo, expressed shock at the differences in opinion shared by President Buhari and Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo.\nAdebanjo said: “It is unfortunate that both President Buhari and Vice President Osinbajo do not understand each other as regards restructuring. I do not know why the Vice President, who is a Professor of Law, does not know what it entails.\n“If you do not restructure, the country would break up. If you say that the unity of the country is non-negotiable, then you do not have a choice than to restructure.”\nWe won’t decide for people — NEF boss\nThe Director-General of the Northern Elders Forum, NEF, Yima Sen, however, differred saying: “As a group, the Northern Elders Forum, NEF, has met several times with the northern governors and the northern traditional rulers over the issue of restructuring and discussions are still ongoing. But one thing we have decided is that we are going to dialogue with our people and know what they want. Most often, the elites push an agenda because they think that is what those they are leading want and they usually do it out of pride and arrogance.\n“We need to move from the level of sentiments to the scientific. It is important that when such important issues are discussed, the elites should be humble enough to ask their people what they want and that is what we are doing. We are not going to decide for our people whether they want restructuring or not. We are going to ask them and listen to what they have to say.”\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"https://www.vanguardngr.com/2018/11/dasuki-el-zakzaky-buharis-failure-to-obey-court-orders-a-national-embarrassment-soyinka/amp/","2":"1323","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999713898"},{"0":"Nnamdi Kanu, IPOB leader\nBy Ikechukwu Nnochiri, Abuja\nMore details about how the detained leader of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, Nnamdi Kanu was arrested have emerged.\nKanu’s lead defence counsel, Mr. Ifeanyi Ejiofor, on Friday night, confirmed that his client was arrested and detained for eight day by Kenya’s Special Police Force, before he was eventually handed over to their Nigerian counterpart.\nEjiofor who made the disclosure shortly after his team were permitted by the Department of State Service, DSS, to have a meeting with Kanu, said his client was arrested in Kenya on June 18.\nIn a statement he posted on his Facebook page, Ejiofor, said his client was tortured and subjected to various forms of inhuman treatment in Kenya, a situation he said worsened his health condition.\nALSO READ: UNIUYO shuts hostels as suspected rival cult groups clash, kill one\nThe statement titled ‘Update on meeting with MNK today, 2nd July 2021’, read: “My Client – Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, was actually abducted by the accursed Kenya’s Special Police Force on the 18th of June 2021 at their International Airport, and consequently taken to an undisclosed residence under dehumanizing conditions.\n“He was tortured and subjected to all forms of inhuman treatment which worsened his health condition.\n“He was illegally detained for eight (8) good DAYS in Kenya before being transfered to their Nigerian counterpart.\n“He was purportedly investigated on a bogus charge while in their custody, ostensibly, awaiting to be handed over after their findings proved him innocent of all the spurious allegations.\n“They later beckoned on their Nigerian Counterpart to take over.\n“Kenyan Government was deeply involved in the abduction, detention and ill-treatment of my client before the illegal handover to their Nigerian counterpart.\n“A scan of his heart showed that the heart has enlarged by 13% due to the dehumanizing treatment meted to him.\n“There will be need for immediate proper medical examination and attention for him.\n“Mazi Nnamdi Kanu conveyed his goodwill message to all IPOB family members worldwide, and craved for your unrelentless prayers.\n“We are going back to the Court for the needful.

It is not a crime to take a vacation after working so hard for 12 good months.”\n“Even while on vacation, the Governor was coordinating his team from his vacation.

These are challenges that require a long period.\n“While that one is going on, anybody who wants to place an order from manufactures will also be signing a contract agreement for the meters.\n“Those who want to import will also be making orders for importations,’’ Balogun explained.\nThe indigenous meter manufacturer said he could not fathom how the NERC came up with such directive, because of the time frame required in the processes.\n“NERC only engaged few MAPs last week and then we have Mojec and others, including two Discos and we still have about 8-9 Discos which are on the process of licensing.\n“However, the process needs to be expantiated so that the media will have a clear understanding of the issues and the directive.\nHe said that according to NERC perspective, meter prices have been benchmarked on what was accepted for consumers to pay.\nHe said that consumer would be paying between N36,000 to N37,000 on single phase meters and between N63,000 and N67,000 on three phase meters, saying that was the position of the regulator.\n“We have the capacity to roll out massively, when the projects kick start and we also pray for that.\n“We have sufficient financial support from financial institutions like the CBN and other financial institutions that will support the schemes to have sufficient fund to rollout meters massively.\nOn April 3, 2018, the NERC introduced the MAP regulation to new investors in the power sector to fast-track the roll-out of meters through the engagement of third-party investors.\nThe Commission issued permits to Meter Asset Providers (MAPs) on April 5 in accordance with section 4(3) of the MAP Regulations 2018, to MAPs that were successful in the procurement conducted by Abuja and Jos Discos.\nSection 4(3) of the MAP Regulation 2018 require all electricity distribution licensees to engage MAPs that will assist as investors, in closing the metering gap and thus eliminating estimated billing in the Nigerian Electricity Supply Industry (NESI).\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"https://www.vanguardngr.com/2019/04/why-may-1-deadline-roll-out-of-new-electricity-meters-not-realistic/","2":"851","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999885559"},{"0":"Sen. Buruji Kashamu\nBy Ikechukwu Nnochiri\nABUJA – An Abuja High Court sitting at Apo, on Wednesday, voided the expulsion of Senator Buruji Kashamu who is representing Ogun East, from the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP.\nThe court, in a ruling that was delivered by Justice Valentine Ashi, equally set aside the expulsion of Ogun State Chairman of the party, Engr Adebayo Dayo.\nJustice Ashi held that the purported expulsion of the duo was unlawful, saying it was done in flagrant disobedience of a subsisting order the court made on December 7, 2017, and further restated on January 9, 2018.\nThe said order had directed parties in a suit pending before it, which included the PDP, not to do anything to jeopardise the subject matter of the litigation.\nWhile re-affirming the order, the court specifically warned the PDP not to carry out any disciplinary action against the Defendants without recourse to the pending proceeding before it.\nMeantime, in his ruling that nullified the later expulsion of the Plaintiffs, Justice Ashi, equally set aside PDP’s letter dated August 1, conveying the expulsion to Kashamu and Dayo.\nThe judge ordered the National Chairman of the PDP, Mr. Uche Secondus, to within 48 hours of his receipt of the court order, show cause why the court’s disciplinary measure should not be deployed against him for aiding his party to violate a valid court order.\nIn the alternative, why he (Secondus) should not be referred to the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) and Minister of Justice for prosecution, before the Magistrates’ Court of the FCT, for obstructing the course of justice.\nThe ruling followed an application marked: M/8696/2018, which Kashamu and Dayo filed through their lawyer, Mr.Charles Ndukwe.\nThe PDP had on December 4, 2017, sued Kashamu and four others, seeking among others things, an order restraining Kashamu and the other defendants from preventing it from carrying out its legitimate activities, including its national convention that was slated for December 9 and 10, 2017.\nHowever, the court, on December 7, 2017, granted PDP’s ex-parte motion and ordered parties to maintain the status quo by refraining from doing anything capable of jeopardising the hearing of both the pending interlocutory application and the substantive suit.\nSued with Kashamu were Chief Makanjuola Ogundipe (PDP South West leader), Alhaji Adewale Adeyanju, Engr Adebayo Dayo and the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).\nOn January 9 when the case came up for hearing, the court, upon complaint by Kashamu and Dayo, vacated their suspension by the PDP on the premise that it was carried out while the case was still pending.\nThe court proceeded to restrain the PDP from taking any disciplinary action against the Defendants without first making recourse to the court.\nNevertheless, on July 24, PDP announced the expulsion of Kashamu and Dayo via a letter dated August 1, a copy of which was served on the Defendants.\nDissatisfied with the action, the duo re-approached the court to seek redress.\nRuling on the matter, Justice Ashi agreed with the Applicants (Kashamu and Dayo) that the order made on December 7, 2017 and restated on January 9, 2018 was still binding on the plaintiff (PDP) and all parties despite the fact that PDP subsequently abandoned the case.\nJustice Ashi noted that even when the main suit was struck out, the counter-claim filed by Kashamu and other defendants was still pending.\nHe rejected PDP’s objection to the suit and held that the legal Action Kashamu filed against the party before the Federal High Court in Abuja was different from the one before his court.\n“In my view, the Plaintiff/Respondent was in error to have expelled the defendants in utter disregard of the order of the court, including the directive that no disciplinary action should be taken against defendants while this suit subsists.\n“The facts before me show that there has been a consistent pattern violation of the orders of this court by the respondent (PDP) with impunity.\n“On the strength of the doctrine of lis pendens, it is wrong for the respondent to have acted this way against the applicants.\n“It is trite law that where a party carries on an activity which is either out rightly by prohibited by a positive court order or where such party, after having due notice of a pending application brought against him to restrain him from so doing and he nevertheless goes ahead to do those very things that are either expressly prohibited by an order of court or in respect of which notice has been given, this court has the jurisdiction to undo what has been wrongly done and put parties back to the status quo.\n“In my view, that is what ought to be the justice of this case. Accordingly, and in consequence, I make the following orders:\n“The purported expulsion of the 1st and 4th defendants from the PDP as announced by the respondent in the media and the letter of expulsion addressed to them and two others, which letter is dated the 1st of August 2018, is hereby set aside and nullified as an act done in gross and wilful violation of an express order of court made on the 8th of December 2017 and the 9th of January 2018 directing parties to maintain the status quo and in particular, not to acrry out any disciplinary action against the applicants without first having recourse to this court.\n“The said letter of expulsion of the applicants made by the respondent on the 1st of August 2018 is hereby set aside and declared null, void and of no effect, in that it was made in gross violation of the aforesaid subsisting orders of the court.\n“The National Chairman of the respondent party herein (PDP) is hereby ordered to show cause by affidavit, within 48 hours of the service of this order on him, explaining while the court’s disciplinary measures should not be meted out on him on the account of the contemptuous and gross violation of this court’s order made on the 9th of January 2018 or explaining why this court should not refer his conduct to the Attorney General of the Federation for prosecution before the Chief Magistrate’s Court of the FCT for the offence of obstruction of the course of justice.\n“The case is fixed for the hearing of the cause to be shown, as ordered herein on the 17th of October 2018”, Justice Ashi held.\nComments

114 LG roads\n……Commissions Lay-By, Slip Road in Alapere\nLagos State Governor, Mr. Akinwunmi Ambode on Saturday flagged off a week long commissioning of 114 roads newly constructed in all the 57 Local Government Areas and Local Council Development Areas (LCDAs) in the State, with a pledge to commence the construction of second round of another 114 roads across the State soon.\nThe construction of the inner roads, which is an initiative of the Ambode administration and in fulfillment of his campaign promise, was geared towards massive intervention on access and link roads, boost security and increase the socio-economic well-being of residents of the State.\nThe newly constructed 114 roads which were designed with walkways, medians, street lights and standard drainage systems, were selected two per each of the 57 LGs and LCDAs in the State.\nSpeaking at the formal flag off of the commissioning ceremony in Ikorodu North LCDA, Governor Ambode said the remarkable feat was not only an eloquent confirmation of a promise kept, but a testimony of the popular saying that nothing can stop a people who have resolved to move forward.\nThe Governor, who was represented by his deputy, Dr, Mrs Idiat Oluranti Adebule, recalled the contract of hope which he signed with the people during the electioneering and his inaugural speech, adding that the completion of the 114 roads was a glorious dawn of community development accelerated through inclusive governance and a historic leap of faith for his administration and the citizens.\n“This means that the road network in our State of Excellence has increased by 56.1 Kilometers. It means that we have added 112 Kilometres of walkways and covered drains. And it means additional 56.1 kilometres of our roads are being lit by independent powered street lights to improve the security of our neighborhoods, the visibility of pedestrians, commuters and motorists as well as creation of a night economy.\n“At a time the national economy is facing financial challenges, our administration is able to inject over N19 billion into the economy of our State, stimulating employment and engaging the business sector.\n“No fewer than 89 local companies executed the road project with thorough supervision by the communities and government. About 5,700 direct jobs were created for professionals, artisans and laborers in the construction industry. A larger number of people, approximately 10,000 suppliers and dependants felt the positive impact of this stimulus package in their lives,” Governor Ambode said.\nGiving an insight as to how the roads were selected, the Governor said in line with the principle of civic engagement of his administration, Community Development Associations (CDAs) were encouraged to suggest the roads requiring construction according to their needs, adding that the CDAs were also motivated to participate in the monitoring of the projects with the view to taking ownership on completion.\nHe said Jimoh Street in Ikorodu North LCDA which was the first to be commissioned, was one of the community driven projects, adding that the road was picked as the first to be commissioned in appreciation of the diligence of the contractor, DC Engineering for being the first to complete the project within the stipulated six months. He said the road, no doubt, would go a long way in improving the State and make it a preferred investment destination worldwide.\nBesides, Governor Ambode said the 114 roads would be an annual rite to make Lagos a true megacity, adding that the process for the second round of the 114 road projects had already begun, and urged the residents to be part of it and guard the infrastructures being provided by government jealousy.\nIn a similar development, Governor Ambode also commissioned the Ketu-Alapere Lay-by and 700m concretized Slip Road, saying that it was another mission statement of his administration’s commitment to making life better for residents and investors in the State.\nSpeaking through his Deputy, the Governor said that the new look of Alapere-Ketu Lay-By, was characterized by the construction of a two-lane access road from Iyana Oworo inwards Alapere-Ketu that would relieve traffic flow towards Lagos-Ibadan Expressway and Ojodu-Berger axis.\nHe said that provision was also made for pedestrian safety with the integration of a two-metre wide walkway and drainage on one side of the lay-by access inwards Alapere-Ketu, to ensure that vehicular movement is not impeded by pedestrians.\nGovernor Ambode urged transport unions to educate their members on observation of State Traffic Laws and road etiquette for the safety of all, saying that the provision of the lay-by will considerably reduce travel time for all motorists therefore, commercial vehicles have no cause to create gridlocks in order to get to their destinations.\nApart from being concretized, the Slip Road also comes with horticulture, artworks, walkways, covered drains and street lights, and is designed to last for at least 25 years.","1":"http://thenationonlineng.net/ambode-flags-off-commissioning-114-lg-roads/","2":"1041","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999637604"},{"0":"File: Governor Akinwunmi Ambode of Lagos State, during his visit to President Muhammadu Buhari, at the Villa, on Friday, April 29, 2016.\nGovernor Akinwunmi Ambode of Lagos State, on Friday, paid a visit to President Muhammadu Buhari at the State House, Abuja, where he lauded the President’s recent overseas trips aimed at attracting foreign direct investments into the country.\nGovernor Ambode who spoke to State House Correspondents shortly after the visit expressed high optimism that the President’s trips would in no short time begin to yield benefits in the interest of all Nigerians.\nThe Governor specifically commended President Buhari for his purposeful leadership to restore the nation’s place in the comity of nations, saying his recent trip to China and the profitable discussions will go a long way move Nigeria forward, including Lagos.\nHe said the investment pact signed with the Chinese Government will benefit the people of Lagos, especially with the coming of the Lagos-Kano Rail Project and the Lagos Metro-rail project expected to cost about $2.5billion.\nIt would be recalled that President Buhari recently returned from a one week visit to China where Nigeria signed series of investment pact expected to yield about $6 billion investment for Nigeria and also expected to have positively huge impact on key sectors of the Nigerian economy including power, solid minerals, agriculture, housing and rail transportation.\nHe said the visit was therefore to thank President Muhammadu Buhari for his laudable plans for Nigeria and especially Lagos State.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"http://www.vanguardngr.com/2016/04/ambode-visits-aso-villa-commends-buharis-economic-drive/","2":"348","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9998340607"},{"0":"For her third World Cup, Francisca Ordega wanted to stand out.

That is my statement, we cannot guarantee the implementation of constituency projects in the 2016 budget. As a government, constituency projects are championed by members of the National Assembly. Like the legislature, members of the executive are politicians who canvassed for votes.\n“Lawmakers are aware that oil barrels had dwindled to about 800,000 per day. This has led to the inability of government to finance the budget.

It is just the midpoint of the range we have. If it falls to $70, we are ready with additional measures. We have organised a set of measures around $73 dollars.

Someone told me that to prosecute an effective governorship election in Imo that about 5 billion naira could be needed. It will sound outrageous until you start. You will start with notice me philanthropy and mid-night meetings.\nThose who come to the meetings will have to go back with something. This early stage of warming up to small gods costs quite a bit.\nThen when the time comes you may have to buy the ticket of a good party. You saw what happened in Port harcourt in 2019. A newcomer with loads of money can stage an ambush, on the eve of the primaries, and mop up all the delegates. So you have to be alive to small things like booking and seizing hotels and bureau de change facilities.\nAfter you have captured a good ticket, you have to resurrect and renovate the structures of the party in the state. If you have an existing godfather then your job is not daunting, you are a baby being carried on the back. Structures of opposition parties in many states have seasonal lives. They go into hibernation after elections and have to be resurrected.\nThe god-fatherless, after buying his ticket, must keep money to fight off hyenas who will come to make clams to it. Sometimes he will pay ransoms and let sleeping dogs lie. Some other times he will have to fight the fight in court. At every stage , at every turn, he is hemorrhaging money.\nWhen campaigns get underway, he will discover that everybody around him will become a mercenary. His bishop, his cousins, his bosom friends. They will all want to be paid for running errands and for praying for him. He will need thugs to strengthen the security already purchased from the police. He will have to hire the boys. That is the way it works.\nHe will go from church to church seeing priests, ‘collecting’ prayers and blessing their pockets. It’s all quid pro quo. Everywhere he goes, he will be expected to drop something and promise something. The traditional rulers will want his gifts. And that tribe that loves long robes, has large eyes.\nWhen he sends money to people, half of the money will get lost in transit. He will never know because receipts are never issued. He will discover after the elections that many of the seeds he sowed, fell by the way side, and were eaten by hungry birds.\nWhen he has his rallies, he will get some people free, but he may have to hire others. There are agents that furnish crowds. And there are all kinds of crowds. Those who remain come rain or shine cost much more. There are the vociferous ones but they have no endurance. So he must know what he wants. He will have to pay to prevent others from scattering his crowds. That’s the way it works. You pay to fetch the crowd. You pay to protect it . Sometimes, you pay to get value, some other times you pay to prevent sabotage. They go hand in hand. You pay rain doctors to stop rain. Then you pay some other rain doctors who come frowning, not to bring rain.\nWhile campaigning, he will have to keep an eye over his shoulders. He can’t afford to sleep or lose concentration. Because his name can go missing from his party’s list, anytime. So he will keep in touch with his party’s secretariat, nursing their moods and greasing their palms.\nBut he must not be deceived. The eve of the elections is critical. He will have to keep money for the election eve. Election gifts expire quickly in Nigeria. So he will start recharging the gifts he had given earlier, two-three days to the election.\nOn election day, money has to reach his agents. Those who have run successful elections will tell you that money has to reach many other institutions and actors too. You can name them. These govt institutions collect theirs in hundreds of millions naira. Those transactions are too filthy to be mentioned here. But every agency that takes part in elections expects gratifications. They collect in bulk and share to their officers.\nThe ground game on election day is very important. If his agents are infiltrated, they can sign fake result sheets and sell him off. So he must keep a tight leash on his network. After the counting of votes, he must stay awake and police his results. And it’s no easy task. Money will chase the result sheets from all angles, so he must be on ground to use money and prevent evil.\nIf he wins and is announced winner then he is lucky. He can take a deep breath before resuming his fasting and prayers.\nMany of the winners would have borrowed from friends and strangers. Many governors get into office with debts running into billions of naira. That is why when they lose, it’s truly a tragedy.\nWhen they win they begin the process of repayment from state coffers. But often times, the cases go to court and the sleeplessness is prolonged. And because the lawyers know what is at stake, some of these lawyers have smartly branded themselves election petitions experts. And they demand hundreds of millions of naira in fees. Behind the scenes some of the senior lawyers will tout their closeness to the judges and to convince a party to an election case to cough out humongous sums. So our friend who has just won his election but who is troubled by a sore loser may be asked to make provisions for some judges by his lawyers. This is the country. That is why judges love election tribunals.\nConsequently, a winner of a governorship election who travels all the way to the supreme court would have to cough out so much money in legal fees. Someone once said the desperate ones could spend up to a billion running helter skelter.\nSo imagine a man of ordinary means who borrows billions and wins, and borrows a billion to defend his victory, only to lose at the Supreme Court. He will be in all kinds of trouble. He might have taken one of two new chieftaincy titles he would not know what to do with again. He might have asked one or two relations to leave certain jobs in or outside the country to come and chop. He might have promised his former headmaster a new house. He might have sent one girl friend to the state liaison house in Abuja. All the appointments he made for which he has collected accolades and gratitude will all be reversed.\nElection losses are especially difficult to take when one has been through seven seas and managed to sit on the throne for seven months. One might have bought secondhand tractors and established a new construction firm under a new name and awarded all roads contracts to that company. One might have dusted up a former governor friend and placed him to chop in the state’s refuse collection agency where nothing can be tracked and two hundred million naira can be siphoned monthly.\nIf only we could sanitize our electoral processes. And put a tight legal lid on electoral expenses. And conclude all litigations before elected official are sworn in.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"https://www.vanguardngr.com/2020/01/why-election-losers-cry-from-the-heart/","2":"1506","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999961853"},{"0":"FG ends feeding of inmates in 2024\nStates should brace up for the responsibility of feeding inmates in Correctional facilities from January 2024, the Federal Government said on Friday.\nThe Minister of Interior, Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola who announced this in Owerri, Imo state capital, said States should take maximum advantage of the constitutional amendment to improve the conditions of inmates in their domains.\nHe said the step would help to further decongest the custodial facilities, which harbour state offenders who make up more than 90 percent of the total number of inmates nationwide.\nAregbesola also reiterated the need for a comprehensive review of the nation’s criminal justice system in a bid to addressing the alarming figure of inmates who are awaiting trial and languishing in jail.\nThe Minister spoke at the commissioning of the Command Headquarters of the Nigerian Correctional Service (NCoS) in Owerri.\nAregbesola, in a statement by his media aide, Sola Fasure, said the Buhari-led administration has done a lot in making the reformation process at Custodial Centres impactful through increased budgetary provision as well as the upgrade of old and construction of new infrastructure at the facilities.\n“One big challenge we have at Corrections is congestion, especially at the urban centres where the population density is high and human relations are more complex, leading to higher crime rate and the need to keep some people behind bars.

The faceoff that emerged yesterday between Afenifere, the Yoruba Socio Cultural group and the Northern Elders Forum, NEF over the feasibility and competence of President Goodluck Jonathan’s reelection was a recall of the mutual suspicion that existed between Nigeria’s first indigenous regional leaders.\nWhile the conflict of the forefathers was essentially centered around regional domination, the conflict that burst yesterday is on the surface focused on the fate of the more than 200 Chibok secondary schools abducted last April.\nAt the peak of the distrust between Nigeria’s founding fathers, the late Northern leader, Sir Ahmadu Bello was quoted as saying that his priority in filling job vacancies in the north would be “first a northerner, then an expatriate and then a southerner and that on contract.”\nBello’s assertion was to be the basis of the chasm and subsequent hostility that shadowed relations between the two sides of the country since independence.\nThe hostility which was fueled by the annulment of the June 12, 1993 presidential election Chief Moshood Abiola was only partially soothed by the election of General Olusegun Obasanjo as president in 1999. However, since the Obasanjo phenomenon and the relegation of the north from its position of political dominance, the seeming discomfort of the north in playing second fiddle in the polity has taken a central role in the polity.\nIt has been especially so under President Jonathan who has generally been affirmed to be Nigeria’s most “troubled” leader. Jonathan has been troubled by the insurgency fanned by what was once thought to be a mainly Islamic agenda. The Islamic Boko Haram group which started by killing Christians, burning and bombing churches has lately expanded its agenda to killing non conforming Islamic leaders bringing to question the real motif of the group.\nWhile some allege that it still has an Islamic agenda, the gruesome and unrestrained brutality of the group has given vent to a political agenda.\nSo when the NEF last Monday urged President Jonathan to forget re-election if the Chibok girls are not returned, the group whether advertently or inadvertently rekindled the regional distrust that existed between the north and the south.\nIn a statement issued by Barrister Solomon Dalung and Dr. Hakeem Baba-Ahmed, the group alleged that the ongoing insurgency in the north was aimed at politically and economically weakening the north to allow the easy reelection of President Jonathan.\n“We also reject the notion that multiple internal security challenges such as attacks on villages, ethno-religions conflicts and banditry springing up by the day in many parts of the north are all a coincidence,” the statement said. “Indeed, we are convinced that most of these conflicts are being engineered to weaken the North politically and economically by interests which intend to exploit such weaknesses for electoral benefits.”\nAlleging that the administration was deliberately allowing the crisis to fester, the NEF said:\n“The lack of a strong will at the level of the presidency to fight it, as well as deep-seated corruption and incompetence in governments and in the management of our security challenges has allowed a band of terrorists to take and hold vast parts of our land and populations hostage, while every citizen lives in fear that they will be its next victim.”\nThe NEF which has such prominent Jonathan bashers as Dr. Junaid Mohammed, Prof. Ango Abdullahi in its fold and had never hidden its revulsion of a second term for Jonathan or the aspiration of any other southerner, was quick to push forward its most notable agenda, to wit, that Jonathan should not re-contest.\n“In the light of our firm conviction that the insurgency and related security challenges pose threats to the 2015 elections and the survival of our nation, we strongly advise President Goodluck Ebele Jonathan to bring an end to the insurgency in all its manifestations and produce the Chibok girls before the end of October, 2014. The circumstances under which our fellow citizens in and around Gwoza in Borno State in particular live and die will not be tolerated by any people who have a government and a leader sworn to defend them, and they must be reversed immediately. In the event that President Jonathan fails to do this, Nigerians will be left with the only conclusion that he has forfeited his right to ask for our mandate beyond 2015.”\nAfenifere in a sharp rebuttal was quick to enter the fray yesterday. The group in a statement issued by its spokesman, Mr. Yinka Odumakin said the statement by the NEF was an exposure of the linkage between the Islamic Boko Haram sect and some northern elites.\n“By linking the electoral fortune of President Jonathan in 2015 to “Bring Back Our Girls” latest by October as well as ending Boko Haram at the time, the “elders” have just confirmed the suspicions in the land that the activities of the Islamic Sect Boko Haram is either enjoying the sponsorship of some elites of the North or at the least having their sympathy.”\nAfenifere was quick to spot out what it referred to as the unwillingness of the northern elders to condemn the activities of Boko Haram while focusing on the alleged failures of the president.\n“In all the sound and fury of the Forum, we searched in vain any outright condemnation of Boko Haram. And this has .been the pattern of most reactions from the majority of the elites of the region who always appear politically correct to the insurgents while using their activities to rattle the government. The most audacious of this perfidy is this direct put by the Northern Elders Forum.”\n“A traumatized country that has been held in anxiety over the fate of the abducted girls cannot but challenge these elders at this stage to appeal to their wards in Boko Haram to release the innocent young girls who now appear cannon fodders in the struggle for “we want our power back”.\n“A time has come to let these elites know they can no longer play the ostrich by burying their heads in the sand and think no one sees them because they are seeing no one.”\n“We, however, frown at the disingenuous attempt by unconscionable elites who are now dishing out two months ultimatum to end an insurgency that they prepared the atmosphere for in decades of exploitation and iniquitous dealings with their own people. Can they name one country that has defeated terror in 60 days?”\n“How many rulers have we had in Nigeria since 1960 and how many come from the North? Why did it not occur to any of them that the Almajiris should go to school?” “The country has suffered enough of the errors of these leaders which has now produced terror in the land, they should stopping pouring salt on the injury,” Afenifere said.\nNorthern Elders on Jonathan\n•Administration is insensitive to the plight of\n•Toying with corruption\n•Has put politics ahead of governance\n•Has closed its eyes to the Boko Haram scourge in the North\nAfenifere on Northern Elders\n•They are cuddling Boko Haram\n•Refusing to condemn Boko Haram\n•Prefer to cite alleged incompetence of Jonathan\n•Not sincere about Chibok girls\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"http://www.vanguardngr.com/2014/08/2015-afenifere-north-fight-dirty/#sthash.QhqOjKY6.dpuf","2":"1594","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999980927"},{"0":"Remarks by His Excellency, Dr. Goodluck Ebele Jonathan, Former President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria\nThe Southern Christian Leadership Conference,\nAtlanta, on Thursday 14th, January, 2016.\nI thank the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, for inviting and honoring me today, and especially so, as this invitation comes right about the period when the world stands still in recognition of the selfless sacrifice of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.\nWhen we think of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), it is virtually impossible to separate this worthy body from its founder, the late great Dr. Martin Luther King Jr, or from epoch making landmark events of the American Civil Rights movement.\nI am pleased to know that the Southern Christian Leadership Conference is not just one of the great American institutions, it is also one of her more potent vehicles for the advancement of liberty and freedom for all God’s people.

These included his cook, his doctor and luggage officer.\nHis predecessor in office went to the same meeting with 150 officials and family members the year before.\nWherever they are given government accommodation and feeding, members of President Buhari’s entourage receive reduced allowances, thereby saving the government some money.\nIn public diplomacy, experts say that it is better conducted through face-to-face interaction than through third parties. This is even moreso at the level of heads of state. To do by it by proxy is to miss the effect of fostering strong interpersonal relations between leaders, by which nations benefit.\nPresident Buhari has so far visited Germany, South Africa, USA, Niger, Tchad, Cameroon, Benin, Ghana, South Africa, India, Iran and Malta, where we are presently for the Commonwealth Summit. Mostly, these were due to either the United Nations, EU, African Union or energy and security-related summits. They were mostly undertaken to attend specific meetings, not State Visits. Looking at these assignments, the trips are inescapable for the President. What would Nigerians say of their leader when see the array of world leaders assemble, as they would shortly be doing discussing climate change in Paris on Monday and their own President is missing from the table?\nThose of us who were around under Abacha read all the taunts about him being a sit-at-home leader. Abacha was despised for not representing his country abroad.\nPresident Buhari’s foreign visits have been marked by punishing schedules. They are always business-like and results-oriented.\nAll trips have been marked by tight schedules. Meeting after meeting, happening back-to-back morning, afternoon and evening. The President has had to travel overnight for some of these meetings.\nThe visit by any president to another country is the highest act in international relations.\nIt sends out a message that that county is important to the visitor.\nIt is not like your usual vacation abroad. Official discussions involving political leaders, the military, the diplomats and at times, business people are held at multi- track levels. In foreign policy you stand on a quick sand of events and you slip up if take a rest or lose focus. Governments also know that their achievements at home will be meaningless if they cannot project them abroad. Who or where are the foreign investors,whose hand you are seeking if you can’t travel meet them? Will they come if they don’t know about the country? President Buhari demonstrated a keen understanding of these when in the first week of his taking the office, he brought together foreign policy and all three cardinal objectives of his administration-security,economy and war on corruption- by embarking on visits to neighboring countries.\nIn our recent history, much of the West had ignored Nigeria under the corrupt PDP administration for many years, which warranted the country’s tilt towards some Asian countries.\nAs a consequence, this country has suffered past isolation of various types, including the denial of access to the arms-purchase market.\nAs a member of the then Standing Committee of the Nigerian Guild of Editors, I remember being in a delegation that visited the Aso Rock Villa, to beg the government at that time not the execute the writer and activist, Ken Saro-Wiwa.\nAt the meeting with the Number Two man in that government, Major-General Oladipo Diya, he announced to everyone’s shock and disbelief that Ken had been executed. “Honestly,” he muted, “I think he has been executed about two days ago.”\nWhat followed that pronouncement was a global outrage.\nThe then Foreign Affairs Minister, Arch. Tom Ikimi representing Nigeria at the Commonwealth meeting in New Zealand, shattered the feelings of the leaders of those countries when he announced to them that he had not been briefed about the executions and begged for time to talk to the leaders back in Nigeria.\nNigeria faced an imminent expulsion from the group and would have been so sacked but for the intervention of the then President of South Africa, late Nelson Mandela.\nIn place of this extreme form of sanction, a suspension and and a barrage of sanctions followed and remained in place until an appreciable remorse was was shown and progress made towards the return to democracy by Nigeria.\nThroughout that period of time, it was difficult being a Nigerian in the international space.\nAs council members of the UN Human Rights Commission, Africans would caucus in Geneva without us Nigerians. Like lepers, we were shunned wherever we showed up.\nI mentioned this short narrative to illustrate two things: one, for a country to do the right things all the time and two, you don’t know the joy being a part of international gatherings until you suffer the pain of exclusion from them.\nShort of begging the world, there was nothing that the Abacha government didn’t do to be taken back into the Commonwealth.\nAnd it is against this background that I felt the need to pen this opinion in the hope of bringing better understanding to fellow countrymen and women on the current subject matter.\nThere is no reason to be angry with anyone criticizing President Buhari for traveling abroad. In politics, even if President Buhari were to bring with him a suitcase full of cash and a pot gold each time he returned from a trip, someone will criticize him, saying that the journey is wasteful.\nThe PDP will kick, knowing that they got 16 years and did nothing with it. Those who didn’t do much during their term of governance will find it instructive to fault whatever the President is doing.\nIf President Buhari is successful as a leader, the PDP will be history.\nMy own point here is that he is doing a great job and the fruits are here, and many more will soon come. He is working to strengthen diplomatic relations, trade and the security of our nation. He holds serious meetings with serious investors and has fetched us investments in the range of billions of US Dollars.\nNow, countries such as France, UK, The U.S are supporting Nigeria with intelligence, weapons and training for our military against Boko Haram and the economic saboteurs in the Delta region.\nPresident Buhari will definitely make Nigeria great,what the PDP fooled us for 16 years.\nAll heads of countries around the world now take Nigeria seriously. His foreign trips are for business, security of the country and bilateral contacts- contacts that get actualized by follow-ups and the love and support a leader enjoys at home and abroad.\nToday the world is in a warm embrace of President Muhammadu Buhari.\nNigerians should be proud of the attention, love and admiration, importance, respect and investment he is bringing to Nigeria. These trips are not for enjoyment.\nLastly, to answer those who ask all the time, what is he bringing back home?\nWe are not a country of beggars. It is good if something is in the bag as the leader comes home from a trip.\nCulturally, we never return home from a trip without a souvenir for everyone left at home. Yes it is good he declares something upon his return.\nBut the most important task for the President at this time is to reset the image of Nigeria abroad, given the damage it sustained over many years in the past.\nSo far, in fairness, the President has projected a large image of Nigeria and of himself which should be a matter of pride for all our citizens. Marketing of Brand Nigeria can never be more important than currently it is.\nThe President is doing a great job for the nation. He needs to be supported.\nGarba Shehu is Senior Special Assistant to the President, SSAP (Media and Publicity)","1":"http://www.pmnewsnigeria.com/buharis-trips-are-not-for-enjoyment-by-garba-shehu/","2":"1841","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999923706"},{"0":"By Dele Sobowale\n“In times of crisis; facts first.” CNN Advert, March 2020.\nNigeria, like all nations in the world today, faces an economic and a health crisis. Unlike others, our nation is burdened by three other major problems. The first is crisis of leadership at the topmost levels of government in Nigeria. The second is the stark reality that there is no ruling political party – as it is known in all democracies. The third disaster, which is inextricably tied to the first, is what can only be described a President who has no luck. Just before Buhari’s army of sympathises, led by his loudspeakers in Aso Rock, think that luck is irrelevant at this time, or one is insulting Buhari, permit me to take our readers, especially the young, through African history.\nSir Milton Obote would be remembered by those of my generation, or older, as the man who led Uganda to independence in 1962 during the “wind of change blowing through Africa.” (Sir Harold Macmillan, British Prime Minister). Like most first generation African leaders in the 1960s, he was overthrown by the military in 1971 and went into exile in Britain. When military rule went out of style late in the 1990s, Obote was recalled to lead Uganda. History has recorded that Obote was kicked out a second time by the army in 1985. No reason to bring other examples from Europe and Asia. Some individuals are just unlucky. No reason why some of them cannot be Nigerian leaders.\nREAD ALSO:50 soldiers killed by Boko Haram in Yobe\n“Luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity.”\nHarvey B Mackay, 1994. VANGUARD BOOK OF QUOTATIONS p 146.\nIt is necessary to take the matter of luck first in the situation in which we find ourselves now. I am aware that those who benefit from our national distress will not want us to consider facts that are embarrassing or inconvenient. For a man who makes his living from hauling human waste, a tragedy occurs when there is no sh*t to carry. Many Buhari’s sympathisers are in that category.\nSince independence in 1960, Nigeria had experienced two recessions, in 1984 and 2016 – both of short durations. The third is underway and inevitable in 2020. All three will be debited to the account of one Head of State – President Muhammadu Buhari. That is a fact which his loudspeakers in Aso Rock cannot deny. They can only offer explanations; but cannot alter the facts. By contrast, General Gowon, in 1973-5, had such an unprecedented deluge of dollars, that Nigeria donated $100 million to the African Development Bank to help poorer African nations. Obasanjo returned in 1999 to see crude oil prices surging upwards. His administration was able to leverage our improved economic future trends to get us out of the debt trap in which we found ourselves. He also established the Excess Crude Account, ECA – which was finally run down by Buhari’s government this year. Goodluck Jonathan was really the good luck President. Crude oil prices went up to $100+ and stayed up for four of his five years – as the Age of Oil went into the twilight zone. Under Gowon and Jonathan, the economy grew at averages of six to eight per cent. Those were our finest periods from the standpoint of economic growth. Only Gowon’s regime took us to full employment – meaning anybody who wanted a job could literally get one.\nWhile Buhari cannot be held totally responsible for the recession of 1984, because he took no part in the coup which brought him to power, the fact remains that he was ill-prepared for it and he had no clue regarding how to manage an economy in distress. Virtually all the measures he introduced made the situation worse. When failure stared his regime in the face, he and the late Major-General Idiagbon resorted to authorised violence. Grandmothers and housewives were whipped by twenty-year old soldiers while on queue for essential commodities – sugar, salt, detergents and soaps, baby food etc. The scarce commodities returned to shop shelves and markets after he left in 1985.\nThe recession of 2016 should not have caught Buhari and the All Progressives Congress, APC, by surprise – if they were really embarking on ruling the nation instead of just seizing NNPC and CBN for whatever reason. Buhari ran for President in 2003, 2007, 2011 and 2015. He lost three times and won in 2015. The least that would have been expected of anybody aspiring to leadership in any country is that they should have a good grasp of what they are likely to inherit – if they win. That explains why effective leaders elsewhere appoint their cabinets within days of getting to office instead of five months as Buhari did in 2015 and 2019. He was unprepared. Any half-decent economist could have predicted that a recession was coming in 2015/2016 even if Jonathan had been re-elected. But, GEJ had Dr Okonjo-Iweala who could have foreseen that possibility and the government would have taken pre-emptive steps to minimise its impact. Mrs Kemi Adeosun was not and can never be in the same class as her predecessor. Nigerians paid dearly for it. We failed to learn our lessons.\n“The APC government has dragged our country down the gutter. This was not what we promised in 2014/15 when we campaigned vigorously for a Buhari Presidency.” Dele Momodu, THISDAY, March 28, 2020, last page.\nDele and I have two things in common. We both worked our hearts out for Buhari. I toiled like a galley slave in 2011 and 2015. In 2011, I actually developed an outline for Economic Governance if Buhari won at my own expense. It took two months of 2015 to realise I had made a grave blunder. Buhari is not worth it. Dele still believed in Buhari and, on March 21, 2020, he wrote about his encounter with the President – who massaged his ego by telling Momodu that he reads his columns. I have been hearing that story since 1987. Reading the two articles, it is clear that my namesake is almost at breaking point with regard to Buhari. He even tried to advise the President on March 21. Pure waste of time.\n“Advice is seldom welcome; and those who want it most always want it least.\nEarl of Chesterfield, 1694-1773, VBQ, p 5.\nIt is doubtful if Buhari reads newspapers himself. Most likely, he reads only what his aides cut out for him. I never flatter myself that he reads my articles. He might not even understand them. I will suggest to my fellow pen-pushers to forget Buhari as a reader – unless they write articles that flatter him. At, any rate, it is impossible to advise a leader, who in the midst of our worst crisis, retires to “the other room” and only addresses the nation through loudspeakers.\nIt is a fact that stewards are not hired for their intelligence but their reliability. Buhari, hunkered down behind his loudspeakers, cannot hear what Nigerians are saying. A President, whose Vice President, Ministers and heads of Departments and Agencies, as well as party leaders cannot access except through a fence – called Chief of Staff – has already deliberately cut himself off from the people he rules and is about to ruin irredeemably. And, now the “fence” is temporarily broken.\n“Every country has the government it deserves.”\nJoseph De Maistre, 1753-1821, VBQ, p 80.\nSince his first prolonged illness during his first term, Buhari has been governing by remote control. He emerges occasionally to make totally forgettable utterances. There has been nothing inspiring Nigerians to make the great efforts and sacrifices necessary to reverse out head-long descent into crushing poverty and anarchy. We already summarised the legacies left behind in relatively short periods by others. In two months time, Buhari would have spent five years in office. His first four years were characterised by excuses and failures. When he chose to re-contest for office and ran with the slogan TAKING NIGERIA TO THE NEXT LEVEL, an article was published on these pages titled THE NEXT LEVEL IS PURE ANARCHY. I was under no illusion that Buhari would allow a free and fair election to be conducted. He would win. Not because of a great performance but because of his cynical reliance on the almajiri votes. He got the votes and now the almajiris are being driven off the streets of Kano and Kaduna states which gave him second term. And, pray what had he done for the millions who voted him into office? Nothing.\nUnfortunately for Buhari and Nigeria, he failed to heed the warning in another article titled THE REVOLT OF THE ALMAJIRIS – in which he was warned that male young almajiris are joining bandits and kidnappers in droves. They are no longer satisfied with the pittance dropped into their beggar’s bowls. They want more. All it takes is the first successful operation fetching thousands of naira at once and a bandit or kidnapper is born. A senator (name withheld) told me that his kidnapped wife recognised one of the beggars who came to their gate for alms. The beggar-turned-bandit had not been seen in the community after his gang collected N5 million as ransom. The North has hundreds of thousands of them now. Premature abolition of street begging in some Northern states without making provisions for their livelihood will certainly add thousands more to hardened criminals in that region. That was before COVID-19.\n“Anger supplies the arms.” Virgil, 70-19 BC, VBQ, p 10.\nIf anyone in Buhari’s government thinks that the pandemic has provided all the excuses for abandoning Nigerians to their disastrous fates, then that person deserves to have his head examined. COVID-19 will certainly add millions of Nigerians to the number of people with nothing to lose. Even the village idiot knows that a hungry man/woman is an angry person. Unprecedented millions of Nigerians face imminent starvation in the months to come on account of recession, COVID-19 and poor leadership. They will acquire weapons. Depend on it.\nAt a time we need a visible leader to reassure us that efforts are being made and measures put in place to minimise the awful impacts of the challenges facing us, an announcement was made by one of the loudspeakers that what other world leaders do – including Africans – is not necessary. We deserve the President who has no luck.\nBut, he will also deserve the anarchy that may follow any time soon.\n“We have no other country…. We must stay here together.”\nGeneral Buhari, January 1, 1984.\nCOVID-19 has done ordinary Nigerians a favour. All the countries of the world have slammed their gates in the faces of our political leaders. Nobody can hope to escape this time. Yes, we must stay here together now….\nTHANK YOU EX-PRESIDENT JONATHAN\n“I never quarrel with those I don’t respect.” US President Richard Nixon.\nI am not on twitter directly. But a lot of my friends and my PA on it drew my attention to ex-President Jonathan’s post in response to my published apology to him. His comments portray true nobility of spirit seldom found in people who have achieved great heights in life. I cannot thank him enough for his broad-mindedness. Like all our leaders, he was a victim of his close associates while in office. It might be of interest to him to know that I was tougher on Babangida in 1985-1992. One fateful visit to the Ministry of Justice Library in Lagos in 2018 altered my views about IBB. The same might still happen to GEJ.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"https://www.vanguardngr.com/2020/04/a-president-without-luck-and-a-nation-on-verge-of-anarchy-1/","2":"2576","3":"Politics","4":"2","5":"en","6":"0.9999885559"},{"0":"Chief of Staff to the President, Abba Kyari has raised alarm over the refusal of some lawmakers who just returned from foreign trips to be screened at the nation’s airports.\nKyari in a letter to the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila said the issue was reported to his office by the Minister of Health, Osagie Ehanire.\nThe letter dated Saturday, 21st March, 2020 tagged confidential and obtained exclusively by TheNewsGuru.com, was signed by Kyari himself.\nKyari in clear terms told the Speaker to order all lawmakers who just returned from foreign trips to submit themselves for compulsory screening at any of the NCDC centres nearest to them.\nTNG reports that as at Sunday night, the number of coronavirus cases in the country had increased from 27 to 31 with three new cases in Lagos and Atiku’s son who tested positive.","1":"https://www.thenewsguru.com/news/nigeria-news/article/leaked-memo-buharis-cos-abba-kyari-writes-gbajabiamila-over-lawmakers-refusal-to-be-screened-at-airport/","2":"192","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999332428"},{"0":"By Jethro Ibileke\nJustice Joy Okeaya-Inneh of a Benin City High Court on Friday issued an interim injunction restraining embattled National Vice Chairman (South-South) of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Chief Dan Orbih, the State Secretary of the party, Hilary Otsu and nine others from participating in the national convention of the party, scheduled to hold from 30 to 31 October, 2021 in Abuja.\nOthers restrained from participating in the convention by the court order in the suit marked B/218/os/2021, include the member representing Oredo Federal Constituency, Omoregie Ogbeide-Ihama, Hon.

Nobody has said that the bribe was given to somebody in CBN. It said it was given to some top government and political officials in Nigeria.\nâ€œAs far as I am concerned, at this level, I place them on the sameÂ level of accusation that the Governor of the CBN is pursuing a Northern agenda. When they begin to give names, when they trace the money to Nigeria or to a Nigerian, I would expect EFCC to swing into action.\nâ€œAs I speak to you, to the best of my knowledge, not a single Nigerian has been named in the issue. Is it a true story? I do not know. I think that as they continue tracing the money, they would end up finding where it went.â€\nThe immediate past Governor of the apex bank, Professor Chukwuma Soludo, had in an interview with Vanguard in 2006, when CBN was planning to introduce the polymer notes, said: â€œWe are planning or not planning is not the word. The whole issue of this currency policy is evolving include the clean note policy.\n”That is part of the master-plan that we are planning. It links also to the design, to the restructure that we mean. The polymer technology is new, and is not being used widely around the world.\n”People who advocated the idea do think that is the best thing that has happened while those against it think it is the most horrible thing.\n”We, atÂ CBN, are open to examine our actions, but will be guided by what is in the best interest of Nigerians.\n”For example, I want to get down to what you said about security features.\n”Most people think that the polymer is more difficult to counterfeit than the paper, and that the major reason people are moving to the polymer is because of the security.\n”In Chile, they launched it last week, and was the major argument that they had.\n”People say the marks can washout because they are plastic. We are open. We are going to have presentations from the various groups.\n”If we have any cause to change one side or the other, we will also subject it to serious scrutinising in terms of technology and compatibility with the master-plan that we are developing for the mint.\n”The cost-benefit analysis will also be considered. The major reason people call for the polymer is that it is durable, it is plastic and it can last for an average of three to nine years or more. It is also more expensive to print.\n”For us, it is going to be another cost-benefit analysis and also given the technology that we have.\n”It will cost us a lot of money to begin to redo them.

He left the PDP with his teeming supporters and party stalwarts across the Southwest to partner the party of the progressives – APC – towards the attainment of these noble objectives.”","1":"http://thenationonlineng.net/new/pedro-joins-apc-2/","2":"263","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999370575"},{"0":"By Michael Eboh\nLead investors of the proposed $1.5 billion ship repair facility, Badagry Ship Repair and Maritime Engineering Company (BSMEC), Monday, disclosed that its decision to site the project in Badagry, rather than in the Niger Delta was based on a sound and rigorous feasibility studies.\nThe decision to site the project outside the Niger Delta has been a source of controversy, as different groups in the region have condemned the move, while some threatened to shut down the operations of Nigerian Liquefied Natural Gas Company, NLNG, in the region, especially in Rivers State over the alleged location of the Drydock in Badagry, Lagos.\nThis was even as the NLNG had dissociated itself from the ownership of the project, stating that its only involvement lies in encouraging investors to consider building dry docks in the country.\nBSMEC, in a statement by its Project Director, Mr. Laolu Saraki, stated that for every wise investor, the place of a research-backed feasibility study cannot be relegated, adding that a painstaking process was carried out in order to produce a tested feasibility study.\nAccording to him, the purpose of the feasibility study was primarily to answer some of the questions and concerns, one of which is if it is commercially viable to develop a new shipyard for the repair of large ships including LNG carriers. He said, “To answer this question, two fundamental pieces of information are required; the revenue available and the costs of developing and then operating the shipyard.\nThis information was then input to a business model to produce a business plan. “The pre-project technical consultant, Royal HaskoningDHV, took a completely independent approach working from first principles to establish the input for the business plan.\n“To determine the revenue, Royal HaskoningDHV carried out a market study using raw data, local and regional, on vessel movements and fleet characteristics. This provided a picture of the total market available to a large ship repair yard situated in Nigeria.\n“From the range of available vessel types and sizes identified, a coherent target mix was derived that would efficiently utilize the shipyard facilities. The only mandatory ship type to be included in this mix was large LNG carriers. A view was then taken on the proportion of the available market for the coherent target mix that the new shipyard could reasonably expect to capture.\n“The resulting projected throughput was an average of 12% of the available market across the coherent target mix. The revenue could then be calculated by applying current market repair rates to the projected throughput.” Continuing, Saraki noted that, “The cost of developing a new large shipyard is dependent on the site conditions where it is constructed.\nTherefore a search was made of the whole Nigerian coast and inland waterways for a location which provided the best technical balance of factors including access to deep water, good ground conditions, local workforce, free trade zone, transport links, access to suppliers and contractors.\n“In addition to this, the perceived attractiveness of the location for ship owners and for investors was taken into account. Royal HaskoningDHV concluded that for the purposes of the feasibility study, Badagry Port should be the selected site to provide data input to the business model.\n“Following the positive conclusion of the study, Royal HaskoningDHV was commissioned to manage an open competition to select the Lead Investor to take the project forward. Accordingly, potential investors and developers made written submissions, which were evaluated against a common set of criteria.\n“The successful organization was Badagry Ship Repair and Maritime Engineering Company (BSMEC), a consortium of five Nigerian companies. Although we have been provided with the feasibility study, we do not have any onus to follow its findings.”\nSaraki further stated that BSMEC is free to develop the new shipyard in whatever location and to carry out whatever throughput of business it wishes as long as it includes the capacity to repair large LNG carriers.\nAccording to him, in return for the undertaking to include the LNG carrier repair capability, BSMEC is able to call upon the promotional support of the initiators of the feasibility study, namely Nigeria LNG, Hyundai Heavy Industries and Samsung Heavy Industries.\nHe, however, reiterated the unwavering commitment of BSMEC to bring this concept to reality and use it as a veritable platform to contribute substantially to Nigeria’s economic growth.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"http://www.vanguardngr.com/2015/09/why-badagry-emerged-preferred-site-for-lng-shipyard-project-bsmec/","2":"932","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999847412"},{"0":"Going to an Ivy League School or college is a magnificent achievement.

Secession is the new demand for states and local governments.\nVideo game kids\nFor too long, post-1967/70 children who didn’t experience Nigeria’s civil war have been playing with fire. They have been behaving as if war is just another video game, in which contestants can score points without bloodshed and real-life consequences.\nWar costs more than data plan on a digital device; it’s more than virtual experience on a console. Nigeria’s civil war cost more than one million lives, displaced and disrupted the lives of millions more, and left even a greater number stranded with permanent scars.\nForty-seven years after the war ended, the country has yet to recover and both the Igbo and non-Igbo political elite have been hand-in-glove in betraying any hopes for genuine progress.\nNo lessons have been learnt. This is largely because the older generation whose responsibility it is to shine the light and call the rascals on all sides to order prefer to play politics with the country’s future. Those who are not playing politics are maintaining criminal silence, which is just as reprehensible.\nTail wags the dog\nIt’s time to call a spade by its name. When Kanu was released on bail on April 28 most well-meaning Nigerians across ethnic lines who had called for his release, genuinely believed that he would respect his bail bond by disciplined and restrained conduct, especially in his public utterances. But no. Not only did he dishonour his bond, he persisted in making inciting and vexatious comments and behaved as if the installation of the Republic of Biafra at which he would be crowned the new potentate was only days away. MASSOB leader, Ralph Uwazuruike, has also been trying to out-trash Kanu’s war and secessionist rhetoric.\nOn May 29 IPOB/MASSOB organised and led the shutdown of many parts of the South East, with mobs subjecting those who wanted to continue their normal lives to violent attacks.\nPolice and fishwives\nStrangely, the police and the entire security apparatus looked on. Strangely, too, the governors of the entire South East and their political leaders, including Senator Enyinnaya Abaribe, who posted Kanu’s bail bond, turned a blind eye. Are we a serious people?\nKanu’s conduct and utterances since his release on bail are deplorable; but no less deplorable are the so-called Arewa youths and their “Kaduna Declaration.”\nThe fellows have no right under the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria to deploy a traffic sign, much less order fellow citizens to leave their places of residence. That ultimatum was an insult on our collective sensibilities and must be condemned.\nIf the current feeble political leadership had not infected our security services and turned the police into fishwives, Uwazuruike, Kanu and the Arewa youth jokers will all be in custody by now; they have become a danger to themselves and to the society. I laugh when the Inspector General of Police and his men pretend not know where the fellows are.\nI’m also appalled by the mushrooming of ethnic groups whose singular purpose appear to be how to break up Nigeria and leave with their own fragments of the whole. From Yugoslavia to the Soviet Union to Sudan, breakups have hardly ended in the romantic tales canvassed by the instigators.\nOf course, diversity and multiculturalism have their challenges, but there’s not a single one of the countries mentioned above that was not better off and more prosperous together than they are today. To put it bluntly, all the countries are worse off.\nIt’s been said in some quarters that after watching the South West produce a president on the heels of the OPC terror; the South South getting the same chance after Niger Delta gangs held the country hostage; and the North using Boko Haram to pave the way for Buhari, South East youths want to take the same violent route to power.\nThe subtext is more complex than it seems; yet there are those who think that if two wrongs don’t make a right, we might as well try a third.\nThere’s no point living in denial. The country is facing difficult times: millions of youths cannot find meaningful jobs, while millions more cannot get a decent education. The few who get it cannot get a fair chance to compete, while infrastructure is breaking at the seams.\nFamilies across the length and breadth of this land are eking out a living with increasing difficulty, while the government grapples with a telling recession. It’s tough; and the harsh times appear to have made Nigerians more vulnerable to exploitation by ethnic and religious chauvinists and bigots.\nYet, in spite of the odds, there is strength in Nigeria’s diversity and promise in its vibrant market of 180 million people.\nThe conflict resolution mechanism is flawed; and because of the lack of transparency at the centre the states are getting away with murder.\nPower to the people\nShould there be more devolution of powers and responsibilities to the states? Yes. But you only need to inspect the havoc in many of the states to understand that until citizens themselves begin to hold governments at all levels to account, 180 million countries out of Nigeria will produce the same result.\nWe’ve seen it play out in fallen nations: those who valorise secessionist hubris or who cannot tolerate others that are not like themselves will ultimately replace one form of tyranny with another. The nonsense must stop.\n*Ishiekwene is the MD/Editor-In-Chief of The Interview magazine and board member of the Paris-based Global Editors Network\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"http://www.vanguardngr.com/2017/06/biafra-quit-notice-nonsense/","2":"1406","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999790192"},{"0":"We’ll retrieve Olusola’s mandate – Fayose\nEkiti State Governor, Ayo Fayose, on Tuesday expressed confidence that his deputy, Prof. Kolapo Olusola, would be declared winner of the July 14 governorship election by the state Election Petitions Tribunal.\nFayose alleged that the governor-elect, Dr. Kayode Fayemi, is holding on to “stolen mandate” which would be retrieved at the tribunal.\nThe governor claimed that the election was marred by irregularities.\nOlusola, who was the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) candidate in the poll, has declared his intention to challenge the result of the election announced by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) at the tribunal.\nThe PDP candidate has up till August 3 to submit his petition as the 21-day window to challenge the result is expected to close on that day.\nFayose spoke in Ado-Ekiti on Tuesday during an unscheduled visit to the new Erekesan Market (Oja Oba) which is nearing completion.\nThe governor, who was cheered by market women during the visit, urged the people of the state to remain calm and be law abiding.\nFayose pleaded with PDP members and sympathizers to keep their cool in the face of alleged intimidation and provocation by the All Progressives Congress (APC).\nSpeaking on the market, Fayose said he was pleased with the pace of work on the project and quality of work done by the contractors.\nFayose said: “This is the only legacy project we have not completed as we have delivered others such as the flyover, the new high court complex, the new Governor’s Office and the dualization of Ado-Ikere Road among others.\n“Though time is no longer on our side, we will surely push this project and as at now only finishing touches remain to be done.\n“I will complete it and commission it before I leave.

How do we feed our population that is supposed to double in about a generation from now? How do we provide jobs for them and employment? Now, these are the challenges. It cannot be business as usual. We cannot sit in the cool and comfort of our past and think that we will be able to bring about change. Change has to come.”\nBelow is an excerpt of the interview:\nHow do you, as someone who is seen as Africa’s elder statesman, say to these African leaders like the former Angolan President, José Eduardo dos Santos?\nThe fact that José Eduardo dos Santos decided to go, for me, is some comfort. That he handpicked somebody to succeed him may not be good as it should be. Maybe that somebody may not do it the way he would have wanted to do it. So, let us see what happens in Angola.\nI know you are sitting here with the benefit of the years you have had in leadership position but you also remember what it is to be like that young man who was imprisoned by military regime. Would you have been happy to be told ‘let us wait and see’?\nYes, I would have been happy to be told ‘let us wait and see’.\nBut you were imprisoned?\nI was put in prison.\nIs it because you believed in freedom of democracy?\nI spoke for democracy. I said if any military man wants to continue to rule, he should put off his military uniform and contest election and for that, I was put in jail. But when I was in jail because Nigerians and the international community stood for me, I came out of jail. When I was released from jail, the hope I had materialized. I am an optimist. I am always full of hope. I look for the best even in the worst of situation.\nBut again, we go back to the same point when you have an elite that is either controlling the ruling of the country or controlling, in the example of José Eduardo dos Santos’s daughter, who runs some of the lucrative business in the country. You can see why it would be disheartening for Africa’s youth.\nThere is a limit to how much you can take on unless you are truly a devil I incarnate and when there is too much pressure, you will give in.\nSo, your message to the youth is to maintain that pressure and to continue believing.\nYes, I believe that they must be ready to also make a bitter sacrifice and that means not accepting the status quo. Look at what happened in Burkina Faso, the leadership there did not want to go, but when pressure was too much, they gave up.\nYou were a big supporter of President Buhari but at the moment, there are a lot of concerns about his health. There are concerns about Nigeria’s economy. What worries you?\nPresident Buhari has not disappointed me. Yes, he is fighting corruption, he is fighting insurgency. We are not there yet and it is not a one night wonder. With what he has done, we should credit him and encourage him to do more.\nIs there something you want to say as a clear message to Africa’s leadership in terms of what they have to do to achieve what the continent is capable of achieving?\nStop doing what is wrong like impunity and corruption. Africa is not destined to have. People try to make excuses, there should be no excuse and then we must place our individual countries and Africa above all interests. I believe that this is what we should do and if we do this, we will get there.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee

children in sub-Saharan Africa\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) says 29 million to 44 million Africans may get infected with COVID-19 in the first year of the pandemic if containment measures fail, according to a study.\nThe WHO Regional Office for Africa in Brazzaville, Congo, disclosed this in a statement posted on its website.\nThe UN health agency also said the study revealed that 83,000 to 190,000 people in Africa could die of COVID-19 in the first year of the pandemic.\n“The research, which is based on prediction modelling, looks at 47 countries in the WHO African Region with a total population of one billion.\n“The new estimates are based on modifying the risk of transmission and disease severity by variables specific to each country in order to adjust for the unique nature of the region.\n“The model predicts the observed slower rate of transmission, lower age of people with severe disease and lower mortality rates compared to what is seen in most affected countries in the rest of the world.\n“This is largely driven by social and environmental factors slowing the transmission, and a younger population that has benefitted from the control of communicable diseases such as HIV and tuberculosis to reduce possible vulnerabilities,’’ it said.\nThe lower rate of transmission, however, suggested a more prolonged outbreak over a few years, according to the study.\nIt also revealed that smaller African countries alongside Algeria, South Africa and Cameroon were at a high risk if containment measures were not prioritised.\n“Containment measures, which include contact tracing, isolation, improved personal hygiene practices and physical distancing aim to slow down the transmission of the virus so its effects happen at a rate manageable by the health system.\n“Physical distancing is not about the confinement of people but rather avoiding unnecessary contacts as people live, work and socialise as a means to interrupt transmission,’ it said.\nThe statement quoted Dr Matshidiso Moeti, the WHO Regional Director for Africa, as saying:“ While COVID-19 likely won’t spread as exponentially in Africa as it has elsewhere in the world, it likely will smoulder in transmission hotspots.\n“COVID-19 can become a fixture in our lives for the next several years unless a proactive approach is taken by many governments in the region. We need to test, trace, isolate and treat,” it further stated.\nIt further said that the predicted number of cases that would require hospitalisation would overwhelm the available medical capacity in much of Africa.\n“There will be an estimated 3.6 million–5.5 million COVID-19 hospitalisations, of which 82,000 – 167, 000 will be severe cases requiring oxygen, and 52, 000 –107, 000 will be critical cases requiring breathing support.\n“Such a huge number of patients in hospitals will severely strain the health capacities of countries,’’ it stated.\nIt said a survey of health services in the African region undertaken in March 2020 based on self-reports by 47 countries to WHO, revealed that there were on average, nine intensive care unit beds per one million people.\n“These will be woefully inadequate. Additionally, the physical access to these services to the general population is very low, suggesting many people will not even have the chance to get to the needed care.\n“Diseases that can be managed can easily become more complicated as a result.\n“The study recommends that countries across Africa need to expand the capacity, particularly of primary hospitals and ensure that basic emergency care is included in primary health systems,” it said.\nThe statement further quoted Moeti as saying, “The importance of promoting effective containment measures is ever more crucial, as sustained and widespread transmission of the virus can severely overwhelm our health systems.\n“Curbing a large scale outbreak is far costlier than the ongoing preventive measures governments are undertaking to contain the spread of the virus,” it said.\nAll countries in the WHO African Region were using these results through the WHO country offices to inform their containment actions.\nThe detailed methods and results were currently in press at the British Medical Journal-Global Health after extensive peer review and validation.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"https://www.vanguardngr.com/2020/05/covid-19-may-infect-44m-africans-who/","2":"898","3":"Health","4":"3","5":"en","6":"0.9999961853"},{"0":"A yet to be identified man has threatened to commit suicide by climbing a telecommunications mast.\nThe incident occurred on Friday in Jalingo, the Taraba State capital in the north-eastern part of the country.\nAccording to eyewitnesses, the man was seen approaching the mast with chains around his waist without knowing that he had the intention of climbing the mast.\nSpeaking to Channels Television, two persons – Mohammed Aminu and Suleiman Musa – explained that they suddenly discovered that the man was already at the peak of the mast.\nREAD ALSO: Court Orders Remand Of Former AGF Adoke For 14 Days\nThey added that he started shouting and throwing down papers with a short message entitled ‘To Whom It May Concern’.\n“I did not know when he climbed the mast; I’m the guardsman here,” said Aminu who added, “This is the first of its kind.”\n“He was throwing down some papers which were picked by some persons,” the guardsman narrated.\nThe man, however, made a demand that he would only terminate the suicide mission if the founder of Synagogue Church of All Nations (SCOAN), Prophet T.B.

Presidential Candidate of the Labour Party in the February 25, 2023 election and first petitioner in the ongoing case at the Presidential Election Petition Court, PEPC, Peter Obi, has in his response to the legal team of President Bola Tinubu, declared that anarchy only reigns where the rule of law is trampled upon.\nObi said this through his legal team in response to the written address by Tinubu’s lawyers who had argued that an interpretation of the law requiring 25 percent of the total lawful votes cast 24 states and the Federal Capital Territory could lead to anarchy.\nAccording to Obi’s media team, in a release on Friday, the LP candidate through his legal team has given a principled response to the threat of Anarchy from the Presidential Candidate of the All Progressives Congress, APC, and the 2nd and 3rd Respondents in the petition, Bola Ahmed Tinubu and Kashim Shetimma, “that if the Court interprets the Electoral Act section 134 against them it might lead to breakdown of law and order.”\nThe release read in part, “Recall that Tinubu’s legal team, led by Wole Olanipekun, had in their final address to the court threatened that, “Any other interpretation different from theirs will lead to absurdity, chaos, anarchy and alteration of the very intention of the legislature.”\nHowever, “Peter Obi’s lawyers led by Dr Livy Uzoukwu and Onyechi Ikpeazu disagreed saying instead that what will lead to anarchy is where the rule of law is trampled upon or truncated, that in such situations anarchy reigns supreme!\nAccording to Obi, “A sentence in the 2nd-3rd Respondents’ address alarmed the Petitioners and millions of Nigerians. The 2nd-3rd Respondents went too low and abandoned discretion when they claimed as follows: “Our submission is that the Petitioners are inviting anarchy by their ventilation of this issue of non-transmission of results electronically, by INEC.”\n“Obi’s legal team noted that they found Tinubu’s outburst as “a cheap, misguided, and destructive blackmail clearly intended to target the country’s judicialism and constitutionalism. It also aims at cannibalizing our democracy.\n“The legal team also noted that the careless and absurd statements of the 2nd and 3rd Respondents intend to raise the issue of insecurity if the Petitioners were to emulate the bad example of the 2nd-3rd Respondents but remarked that such will never happen because of the petitioner’s discipline and peaceful disposition and believe in the rule of law.\n“Still underscoring the pointlessness and the supererogatory of the Respondent’s threat, Obi’s legal team wondered, ‘When has it become offensive for Petitioners to canvass a ground prescribed for the challenge of an election in section 134(1)(b) of the Electoral Act 2022?\n“The legal eggheads attributed the needless flare-up and effusion of the Respondents to desperation taken too far which can be extremely dangerous.\n“Let the 2nd-3rd Respondents know that where the rule of law is trampled upon or truncated, anarchy reigns supreme.”\nThe Electoral Court is expected to enter judgement in the matter soon.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"https://www.vanguardngr.com/2023/07/where-rule-of-law-is-trampled-upon-anarchy-reigns-supreme-obi-replies-tinubu/amp/","2":"738","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999504089"},{"0":"WHEN the just concluded Lagos City-Wide Crusade kicked off on September 8, not many people envisaged that the General Superintendent, Deeper Christian Life Ministry (DCLM), Pastor William Kumuyi, 74, could withstand the rigour of the 18-day non-stop event, let alone travelling from one location to the other with all the stress involved. But he did, in what some participants described as utmost sacrifice for the salvation of souls.\nThe results were overwhelming, as the crusade, organised by the DCLM, in conjunction with the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) recorded over 40,000 converts to the Christian faith, aside diverse miracles that took place.\nIn Ikorodu, alone, over 4,682 people made decision for Christ, while in Badagry, over 5,000 people received salvation. In Epe, information gathered revealed that about 4,000 people got converted, while in Agege over 1,500 people reconciled themselves with God.\nIn Surulere, a 22-year old man, Uche Nwaogbola, deaf and dumb from birth, spoke for the first time. His teacher in the deaf and dumb class, Ms Lovett Osondu, was amazed, saying: “It is a miracle.” Martins Nwankwo, who was paralysed and bed-ridden, was also miraculously healed at the Surulere crusade.\nIn Shomolu crusade, which held at the University of Lagos, a 200-level Law student, Miss Ayomide Akinbode, testified to her miraculous healing. A year ago, according to her, she noticed a lump in her breast and visited several hospitals without a solution but after Pastor Kumuyi’s prayer, the lump disappeared.\nChairman of CAN, Isolo, Ejigbo and Oshodi Province, Archbishop Peter Febusoro, who was overwhelmed with the manifestation of God’s power, pointed out that the crusade not only brought unity within the Christendom, but also helped to rebuild lives, which were in shackles.\nFebusoro said: “It was a well organised crusade. Everything was in order. Everybody that came saw the presence of the Holy Spirit. I just think that such a thing could be coming up once in awhile so that people can be revived. It will help to reshape the lives of people in the state because a lot of things have been happening in terms of criminal activities, immoral acts and other vices.\n“The crusade could tackle these acts. Like in Isolo, most people who attended the crusade would have by now changed from their wayward ways of doing things and come to God. Pastor Kumuyi talked on so many things that would touch the lives of the people,” the CAN chairman stated, hoping that other churches will capitalise on it to achieve what the crusade was envisioned.\n“That is why I said that I hope the crusade would come once in a while because it will bring unity among the Christendom. Christians were not as united as the other religion. But with this crusade, we have seen unity. For me, it is a joy,” he stressed.\nThe Managing Director of Jones-Olu Nigeria Enterprises, Jones Bagbe, was particularly concerned about the follow-up of the converts to establish and sustain their conviction in Christ, noting that it would enhance positive socio-moral disposition in Lagos State.\nAccording to him, the level of immorality, criminality, cultism and waywardness in the state is on the high side, but the crusade had brought a lease of life to many families.\nBagbe said: “The impact of the crusade can never be overemphasised, looking at the participation and the joy that pervade every arena where the crusade was held. It will drastically reduce the level of criminality in the society. Therefore, the crusade has been a huge success, judging from the report so far received and the testimonies that were shared in the various locations, as well as the response to altar calls.\n“By now the first and the second batches of the crusade must have conducted their water baptism for the converts, and this is one of the ways to measure the spiritual impact of the crusade,” he noted.\nThe Lagos State Moderator of Deeper Christian Life Ministry (DCLM), Pastor Joseph Fasanmi, had, earlier at a press conference, stated that the crusade was to address not only the alarming rate of robberies, cultism, drug abuse and corruption, among other ills, in the state, but also to usher people into the kingdom of God.\nFasanmi explained that respective governments in Lagos State, since the advent of democracy in 1999, had made significant efforts to improve the socio-political and economic situation, noting that their collective actions could not “sufficiently lift the state because of the people’s attitudinal dispositions, moral and spiritual make-up.”\nHe pointed out that unless the “heart of man was changed and turned around by God” to undertake salutary and positive designs, government’s measure would ultimately be feeble and less impactful.\nAccording to him; “the leaders, themselves, are outcrops of a depressed environment, and cannot be expected to provide enduring solutions to the multifaceted challenges facing mankind and summed up in one word – sin. We make bold to state that it is only a completely changed heart of man by God through the gospel that can bring about a fundamental and unadulterated transformation in our broad landscape.\n“All those that have conquered the basic challenges of development have done so because, at one time or the other in their chequered history, they had embraced the commanding imperatives of the gospel,” he added.\nKumuyi, while noting that the crusade was a divine assignment, stated: “I think the secret is the grace of God. This is the first time we will go through like this for 18 days non-stop, travelling from place to place in the state.\n“We give the glory to God and the cooperation of the people as we have worked together in unity. There is unity in strength and I felt the unity of the people, not only Deeper Life but CAN, everybody, even the media too,” he added.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"http://www.vanguardngr.com/2015/10/lagos-city-wide-crusade-records-over-40000-converts-diverse-miracles/","2":"1342","3":"Religion","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999732971"},{"0":"By Emem Idio, Yenagoa\nFollowing the arrest of the Accountant General of the Federation, AGF, Ahmed Idris by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, over alleged N80bn fraud, the Academic Staff Union of Universities, ASUU, has urged the EFCC to also beam its searchlight on the administration of Integrated Payroll and Personnel Information System, IPPIS, managed by the embattled AGF.\nThe Chairperson of ASUU, Federal University Otuoke, FUO, Bayelsa State, Dr Socrates Ebo, who made the call in a statement in Yenagoa while reacting to the arrest of the AGF, said it is no longer news that both the Auditor General of the Federation and the Head of Service had separately decried the corruption in IPPIS.\nHis words: “Since the deployment of the payment platform, no lecturer can say for certain what his salary is.

All developers agree to these terms and we have reminded Parler of this clear policy in recent months,” the company said in a statement.\n“We recognize that there can be reasonable debate about content policies and that it can be difficult for apps to immediately remove all violative content, but for us to distribute an app through Google Play, we do require that apps implement robust moderation for egregious content,” the statement continued.\nGoogle said that in light of “this ongoing and urgent public safety threat,” it is suspending Parler listings from the Play Store until it “addresses these issues.”\nApple similarly threatened to ban Parler from its app store, BuzzFeed News reported Friday.\nThe tech giant sent Parler an email Friday noting “numerous complaints regarding objectionable content” on its platform, and accusations that Parler was used to “plan, coordinate, and facilitate the illegal activities in Washington D.C.” on Wednesday, according to the report.\nA Parler spokesperson was not immediately available for comment.\nThe app has increased in popularity since the election, drawing in prominent conservative voices.\nParler has branded itself as a pro-free speech platform, citing its decision to largely not moderate content. Posts with election misinformation that may be flagged on traditional mainstream platforms, such as Facebook and Twitter, are left untouched on Parler.\nThe site was also rife with posts about the deadly riot at the Capitol on Wednesday, when a mob of President Trump supporters stormed the Capitol.

It followed a decision announced by Facebook the day before to ban Trump’s account indefinitely, at least until President-elect Joe Biden’s inauguration.\nTrump does not appear to have created a personal Parler account yet, but the app was experiencing outage issues early Friday evening after Twitter announced its decision to ban the president.\nCopyright 2024 Nexstar Media Inc.

Also recovered were £27,000 and N23m cash.\nThe EFCC has intensified investigation into the roles played by some apartment owners and tenants on how the cash was brought into the Towers, The Nation has learnt.\nThe anti-graft agency is said to be suspecting that some owners or tenants may have been complicit in the matter.\nA source said: “The more we investigate this $43.4m haul, the more we get fresh facts. It has become imperative to interact with some owners or tenants of apartments in the Towers.\n“We have invited a former governor and other high-profile owners and tenants for interaction. It is just to ask a few questions on whether or not they were aware of such movement of cash.\n“We have clues linking some occupants of the Towers to the cash haul. And in line with sections 16 and 17 of the EFCC (Establishment Act) 2004, we are inviting these landlords or tenants.\n“Unless we get to the root of this case, Nigerians may not know the truth or otherwise about the cash.\n“We are not saying that those invited are guilty of any infraction or having link with the $43.4million but we need to hear from them – in line with the ongoing profiling of those in the Towers.”\nSections 16 and 17 of the EFCC Act reads: “A person when – (a) whether by concealment. removal from jurisdiction, transfer to nominees or otherwise retains the control of the proceeds of a criminal conduct or an illegal act on behalf of another person knowing that the proceeds is as a result of criminal conduct by the principal, or (b) knowing that any property is in whole, or in part, directly or indirectly represent another person’s proceeds of a criminal conduct, acquires or uses that property or has possession of it, commits an office and is liable on conviction to imprisonment for a term not less than five years or to a fine equivalent 105 times the value of the proceeds of the criminal conduct or to both such imprisonment and fine.\n“(1) A person who, without lawful authority (a) engages in the acquisition, possession or use of property knowing at the time of its acquisition, possession or use that such property was derived from any offence referred to in this section, or\n(b) engages in the management, organisation of financing of any of the offences under this Act; or(c) engages in the conversion or transfer of property knowing that such property is derived from any offence under this Act; or\n(d) engages in the concealment or disguise of the true nature, source, location, disposition, movement, rights with respect to or ownership of property knowing that such property is derived from any offence referred to in this section, commits an offence under this Act and is liable on conviction to the penalties provided in Subsection (2) of this section.\n”The penalties for offences under subsection (I) of this section shall be imprisonment for a term not less than 15 years and not exceeding 25 years.”\nMeanwhile, there were indications yesterday that the EFCC had been able to trace how the controversial 7B apartment, where the $43.4m was kept, was acquired.\nAnother source said detectives discovered that the 7B Apartment was bought in the name of a company allegedly owned by the wife of a senior government official.\n“Since investigation is still ongoing, we will not release the identity of the owner of the company. Doing so might jeopardise investigation,” the source said, adding that the EFCC had interacted with “some people from the company.”\nA National Intelligence Agency (NIA) source said of the apartment: “What happened was that because of the nature of the covert operations which the apartment will be used for, it was necessary to manage the process well.”\nOnly the Deed of Assignment was acquired by Thabis Ventures Limited on behalf of NIA. “And immediately the process for the purchase of the apartment was completed, the ownership was clearly stated in the name of NIA.

Photo by Gbemiga Olamikan\n*Says Nnaka holding Nigeria to ransom\nBy Ikechukwu Nnochiri\nABUJA — The Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Mr. Abubakar Malami, SAN, has denied allegation that he demanded kickback from United States-based attorney, Mr. Godson Nnaka, who is laying claim to 40 per cent of $458 million loot the US government seized from late military dictator, General Sani Abacha.\nMalami said the only communication his office had with Nnaka or his counsel was “only out of professional courtesy.”\nAccording to him, “allegations of a kickback demand are untrue and simply reek of desperation.”\nThe AGF, in a statement made available to Vanguard, yesterday, said there was need for him to address specific misconceptions about the role he had played so far towards securing the return of the Abacha loot from the US.\nThe AGF maintained that the stolen funds, which were frozen in various jurisdictions in the US, would have been returned to Nigeria since, if not for an appeal filed by Nnaka, wherein he is claiming 40 per cent of the forfeited loot as part of his legal fees.\nNnaka holding Nigeria to ransom\nMalami, who accused Nnaka of “holding Nigerian people to ransom and unnecessarily depriving them of the forfeited funds,” said he had already engaged a lawyer to challenge the competence of the appeal.\nHe further challenged the US-based attorney to adduce evidence that he (Malami) requested for a kickback from him.\nGiving his side of the story, the AGF said: “In 2013, as part of its Kleptocracy Asset Recovery Initiative, the USDOJ commenced a forfeiture proceeding to confiscate approximately $550 million that had been corruptly obtained by late General Abacha and his associates (the ‘Abacha Case’).\n“A portion of the Abacha loot, valued at $458 million, has now been forfeited to the United States. On December 17, 2015, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia entered final judgment forfeiting certain Abacha assets valued at $458 million.\n“The forfeiture proceeding as to those assets is, therefore, concluded and the forfeited assets are ripe for repatriation to the innocent victim – Nigeria.\n“However, Godson Nnaka has filed an appeal against the judgment of forfeiture, falsely claiming to be entitled to a portion of the assets as compensation for legal services allegedly rendered to Nigeria.\n“The USDOJ has represented to us that the appeal is the only issue delaying repatriation of the forfeited assets to Nigeria.\n“They have explained that the forfeited assets are not located in the United States and that only upon disposition of the appeal would the United States then have a final judgment upon which it can seek the retrieval of the forfeited assets which are frozen in multiple foreign jurisdictions and return same to Nigeria.\n“The forfeiture of the remaining $100 million in assets is still pending. The forfeiture of these assets is being contested by certain individuals, who are related to Atiku Bagudu (General Abacha’s associate) and who claim that these assets are the subject matter of a private family trust. In this regard, we are co-operating with the USDOJ by providing them with the documents, information, witnesses and other evidence required to secure expeditious forfeiture of this portion of the Abacha loot.”\n“Nnaka claimed to have been retained by former Attorney General Olujimi sometime in 2004, however, the purported letter of instruction from Olujimi states that it is predicated on Nnaka’s representation that there are looted funds in United States banks.”\n“However, the records the Abacha case indicate that the USDOJ, initiated the Abacha matter based on United States Civil Asset Forfeiture statutes and that the funds in question are not located in the United States but are in multiple foreign jurisdictions.\n“Even assuming Nnaka did have a proper letter of instruction from Olujimi, Nnaka never brought any action in the US to recover the monies but claims to have been travelling around to meet with the Abacha family and others for discussions. As stated above. The USDOJ filed its forfeiture action against the Abacha loot in 2013, some 11 odd years after Nnaka claims he was hired.\n“In spite of the above, Nnaka never stopped trying to defraud the Federal Government of Nigeria or to extort settlement from the Federal Government of Nigeria.\n“In 2016, he hired a lawyer to file an appeal in both his name and the name of the Nigeria against the Court’s order striking his filings and dismissing his claim.\n“Nnaka would have needed a separate retainer agreement to act on behalf of Nigeria in any asset recovery litigation.\n“Put differently, Nnaka did nothing to identify, trace and recover the Abacha loot. Even if he did identify assets, he did not actually recover anything on Nigeria’s behalf. All the asset forfeiture litigation was handled by the USDOJ without Nnaka’s participation or assistance.\n“Instead, Nnaka has at each point attempted to intervene and shore up his baseless claim to a 40% fee for doing absolutely nothing. Such conduct is corrupt and seeks to deprive Nigeria of its rightful funds.\n“The office of the AG never negotiated any terms with Nnaka or his counsel. The only communication with Nnaka was only out of professional courtesy. He was advised to follow due process in requesting instructions as outside counsel retained by Nigeria in this case did. He was advised to submit his proposal to President Advisory committee on corruption, the office of the Solicitor General, the Department of State Security and based on evaluation and recommendation from the above bodies, the Office of the Attorney General would consider his request.\n“Nnaka’s allegations of a kickback demand are untrue and simply reek of desperation.\n“We should remember that the person making these accusations was disbarred by at least two bar associations in the United States and one occasion instructed clients to lie on his behalf to the Court! We challenge Nnaka to prove his allegations!”, Malami added.\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"http://www.vanguardngr.com/2016/09/edodecides-nigerians-react-debate-obaseki-ize-iyamu-2-gov-candidates/","2":"1367","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999675751"},{"0":"The presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Tinubu, has replied the presidential standard-bearer of the Labour Party (LP), Peter Obi, who labelled him unfit to contest in the 2023 presidential election.\nTinubu in his response also berated Obi for saying his (Tinubu) supporters are backing him for his money, stressing that he is hale and hearty.\nThis was contained in a statement issued on Tuesday by the Director, Media and Publicity of the APC Presidential Campaign Council, Bayo Onanuga.\nThe statement read in part: “Since he is not Asiwaju’s doctor and is not privy to his medical record, Obi has again disgracefully elevated what has for long been a beer parlor gossip and social media lie being propagated by his IPOB supporters.\n“Obi in his characteristic manner is amplifying falsehood which should not have a place in decent political campaign.\n“We believe that political leaders should be guided in their utterances and be sticklers for the truth, but Obi has thrown all caution to the wind, pronouncing on issues he has no moral and professional competence to make a judgement call on.\n“We want to make it crystal clear to all the traducers of the All Progressives Congress presidential candidate that Asiwaju Tinubu is not ill.

If, as a Commander-in-Chief, Mr. President cannot face a political debate, how then can he vigorously engage international competitors?”\nPDP also tasked the President to muster the courage to “face his failures and avail Nigerians of his sectoral performance scorecards, as well as present his future blueprint, if any, to enable the electorate weigh him alongside our presidential candidate.”\nThere’s no credible opposition—APC\nReacting, APC, in a statement by Deputy National Publicity Secretary, Yekini Nabena, said: “From silly conspiracies on the shape of the President’s ear, a ludicrous allegation of a presidential body double named Jubrin from Sudan, tales on the #NextLevel- Nigeria campaign and the rested certificate issue, Nigerians have been entertained by the comical displays of Peoples Democratic Party, PDP.\n“It is now clear that we have no credible opposition political party, but a gang of selfish and mercantile politicians that will do anything to return to elective office.”\nThe ruling party also alleged that the Dubai meeting attended by Atiku and other PDP leaders was “a last-ditch effort to raise presidential campaign cash from foreign financiers by mortgaging key national economic assets, particularly the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, NNPC.”\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"https://www.vanguardngr.com/2018/11/youre-no-match-for-atiku-pdp-tells-buhari/","2":"604","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9992935658"},{"0":"You are the next President, Ondo monarchs tell Tinubu\nTraditional rulers in Ondo State have promised to work towards the emergence of former Lagos State governor, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, as President of Nigeria.\nThe monarchs said Tinubu’s antecedent stood him out as the next person to take Nigeria to the place of her dream.\nThey spoke separately when Tinubu visited traditional rulers in the three senatorial districts of the state.\nOba Fredrick Obateru-Akinruntan, the Olugbo of Ugboland, who spoke at Okitipupa, headquarters of Okitipupa Local Government, said Tinubu has the charisma and ability to turn the country’s fortune around.\nHe said all traditional rulers in Ondo South have blessed and endorsed him for the number one job.\nIn Akure, the Ondo State capital, Chairman, Ondo State Council of Obas, Oba Aladetoyinbo Ogunlade Aladelusi, Odundun II, said Tinubu would transform the country technologically and in other sectors.\nOba Aladetoyinbo described Tinubu as a maker of men even those he rarely knew.\nHe said the prayers of the obas in Ondo Central Senatorial District would ensure Tinubu becomes the next president.\nOn his part, Tinubu informed the monarchs that he was running for the presidency because he is seriously bothered about the development of Nigeria.\nTinubu stated that Nigeria would compete favourably with Russia in the exploration of oil and gas if its natural resources were properly harnessed\nHe said he knew the problem of the country and if given the opportunity, Nigeria would be ranked among the best nations in the world.\n“I don’t run away from battle. I am very particular and passionate about democracy. During MKO’s time, we tried but we could not get it. When they came to meet us to support Buhari, we sought your support and Buhari became the president.\n“I have gone to inform Buhari that I want to contest, particularly now that it is remaining few months for him. It is not a matter of fight, the constitution stipulated it. Buhari told me to go ahead and declare.\n“I informed Buhari so that people would not say who did I inform before taking the decision. I am the most qualified to become the president. I will ensure that our children get employed, there will be industries and all- round development across the country.\n“Ondo State is abundant in natural resources and Akeredolu is really trying. The job of a president is all about the brain and I have it. Inform everyone that I want to contest. I will make Nigeria to be more developed than Lagos.\n“It is a pity that ordinary brake pads Nigeria cannot produce. I will turn Nigeria around for good. All I seek are your prayers and support for me to become the president. It is your son that wants to contest and I’m that your son.\n“Lagos State was the worst state in Africa when I became governor. We were generating megre revenue then but we did our best then. Look at Lagos now, it generates over N40 billion in revenue\n“Division is one of the problems in Nigeria too but there is no division in Lagos because any tribe or religion is welcome as they can contest and win elections and that is why Lagos is thriving.\n“I am here to seek the blessing of our royal fathers for my presidential ambition because I know where the problems are and if given the opportunity in 2023, Nigeria will be ranked among the best nations in the world.\n“I am imploring all eligible voters to get their Permanent Voters Card (PVC) revalidated for them to exercise their civic responsibilities,” Tinubu said.","1":"https://thenationonlineng.net/ondo-monarchs-to-tinubu-you-are-next-president/","2":"841","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.999917984"},{"0":"By Emma Amaize\nWARRI- HUNDREDS of Ijaw natives from Delta, Edo, Ondo and Bayelsa states residing at Aladja and other Urhobo communities in Udu Local Government Area, Delta State, have started relocating from the localities, as anxiety shoots up over the 14-day quit ultimatum slammed on them by the Urhobo Progress Union, UPU, Youth Wing, Udu chapter, over alleged kidnap of Urhobo people.\nVanguard learned that despite the peace efforts by the Ijaw Youth Council, IYC, UPU, youth wing, and other groups, Ijaw residents in Udu communities feel unsafe since November 17 when the ultimatum was issued and started packing bag and baggage in the last two days to avoid possible hostile response.\nThough the president of Federated Youth of Isaba kingdom, Ogugu Moses, denied that his people were the aggressors, he said in a statement: “On the 11th of November 2016, we the people of Isaba Kingdom released one female and six males of Aladja indigenes alive to Nigeria Navy, Army and Chairman, Delta State Waterways and Land Security Committee, Chief Boro Opudu.”\nHe claimed that Aladja people attacked and burnt Ayama and Pamie, two Isaba communities on 10th, 11th and 12th of November and the seven persons released by Isaba people to government security agencies were strangers found in their territory during the offensive.\nHowever, Urhobo youth leaders insisted on Tuesday that the whereabouts of four natives taken hostage by Isaba people were unknown and demanded their release before they would attend any peace meeting with their Ijaw counterparts.\nThey insisted that Ijaw youths were the ones that occupied Ayama and Epama, two Urhobo settlements becausesome Ijaw oil thieves were prevented from using Ayama as a bunkering route.\nIYC chair, Ogulagha kingdom, Burutu area, Mr Doubra Okotete, who corroborated our findings, said: “There is serious tension in Udu right now as Ijaw people are leaving Udu kingdom because of the inability of the state government to handle the dispute promptly.”\nHe also wondered why the president general of UPU, Chief Joe Omene, should support such an ultimatum by UPU, Udu youth wing, saying: “It is like pouring fuel into fire instead of fighting to quench the fire.”\nHe said: “There is serious tension all over…people have started packing out of their houses and relocating to other areas. Some youths have been engaged in breaking into people’s houses and doing away with their properties and so many crimes are being committed by Udu youths, having created the space for crimes to take place.”\nHis words: “Governor Okowa should sit up, as a matter of urgency, and prevail on the Udu Kingdom by extension the Urhobo to put a stop to the current situation before it develops into an ethnic crisis.”\n“The current situation is solvable if only the government is sincere and willing to make peace. Ijaw People are currently moving out of Udu kingdom, leaving their houses and properties. For those thousands of people moving out, what do you think will be their reaction to other innocent Urhobo sons and daughters living and doing businesses within their own areas, be it offshore or onshore,” he said.\nOkotete, however added: “The ijaw nation is not ready and would never go into crisis with our brothers of the Urhobo nation because what we share as a people are far more than what should tear us apart or break our long-aged relationship. Therefore, I call on Urhobo Leaders in all strata to live up to expectations by prevailing on the Udu kingdom to reconsider its decision and douse the already raised tension.”\nComments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of Vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.","1":"http://www.vanguardngr.com/2016/11/ijaw-indigenes-flee-urhobo-land-tension-rises/","2":"848","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999313354"},{"0":"Ibrahim Babangida has threatened to pull out of the ruling Peoples Democratic Party, PDP,\nBy JOSEPH ERUNKE\nABUJA–DR Maryam Abdullahi, a delegate representing Civil Society Organisation, CSO, at the on-going National Conference, Tuesday, accused former military President, Ibrahim Babangida of starting religious crises in Nigeria.\nDr Abdullahi said the former military ruler pushed Nigeria into membership of the Organisation of Islamic Conference, OIC, without the consent of the people he was ruling, a development, she said started religious crises in the country.\nShe insisted that the relationship between Christians and Muslims deteriorated when Nigeria was admitted as a full member of Organisation of the Islamic Conference.\nAbdullahi, specifically said Babangida, who pushed for Nigeria’s full membership of OIC, did that to manipulate religion in order to perpetuate himself in the office, insisting that this was the beginning of mistrust between adherents of the two faith because of mutual suspicion of possible Islamization of Nigeria.\nAbdullahi spoke while making her contribution to the debate on the report of the conference Committee on Religion, during plenary.\nThe delegate who spoke to the applause of her colleagues, said: “The relationship between Christians and Muslims deteriorated when Nigeria was admitted as full member of Organisation of the Islamic Conference.\n“This made Christians to start resisting any move that would portray Nigeria as an Islamic state.\n“Consequent to this, there is the prevailing mistrust and disharmony between the adherents of the two religions in the country.\n“Mr. Chairman, the then Head of State, that pushed for the admission of Nigeria into OIC did not do that in consultation with the Muslims. He did that in order to manipulate religion as a political tool to perpetuate himself in office and now Nigeria is the worst for it,” she said.\nShe, however, cautioned against viewing every political policy from religious perspective, explaining that OIC an economic forum not only for Islamic states but also for countries that have Muslims minority.\nDr Abdullahi appealed to the conference to allay the fears of Nigerians that nobody would Islamize or Christianize Nigeria and urged political class to stop manipulating religion and ethnicity in order to achieve a political goal.\nShe called for strengthening of the Nigeria Inter-Religious Council in order to promote inter-religious peace and stability, while also calling for inter-religious dialogue in Nigeria.\nBut the recommendations by the Committee on Religion that governments at all levels shall not utilize public funds to sponsor any religious pilgrimages for any category of citizens and government functionaries generated heated arguments among delegates.\nSimilarly, the recommendation for establishment of a National Religious Equity Commission to be jointly chaired by a Muslim and a Christian, generated heated debate among the delegates.\nWhile some delegates applauded the report, others condemned the two recommendations, describing them as unnecessary.\nThe immediate past Minister of Education, Professor Ruqayyatu Ahmed Rufa’i, in her contribution, commended the work of the committee and supported the recommendation that government should stop sponsorship of delegations on any pilgrimages.\nBut she disapproved the recommendation for establishment of a National Religious Equity Commission, arguing that Nigeria already had too many commissions and that there were bodies on ground, especially the National Human Rights Commission to deal with such issues as stipulated in the committee’s recommendation.\nAlso contributing, another delegate, Mr. Atedo Peterside, said he endorsed over 90 percent of the report in view of the excellent work done by the committee but disagreed on the recommendation for establishment of a National Religious Equity Commission.\nHe argued that establishing the commission was like what he described as “using a single evidence to arrive at different results.”\nMr Peterside drew the attention of the delegates to the situation in France where he said religious organisations came together to address some of the problems they faced instead of bringing the government into it.\n“I have strong reservations in this. We should not allow government to get into religion under any guise. Countries that don’t take religion so seriously make far progress than those, who embrace religion.\n“As beautiful as this report is, we should be careful.

Ibrahim Babangida (retd.) yesterday joined the league of Nigerians calling for the restructuring of the polity to give states more power.\nMany groups, including governors elected on the platform of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), have voted for the restructuring of the country—to douse the agitation for secession and for equity.\nGen. Babangida was the Chief of Army Staff in the Muhammadu Buhari military government that toppled the civilian government of President Shehu Shagari on December 31, 1983.\nBut 18 months after, on August 27, 1985, he led the palace coup that edged out Buhari and his Chief of Staff, Supreme Headquarters (second-in-command), the late Gen. Tunde Idiagbon. He ruled as Military President till August 27, 1993, when he was forced to “step aside”.\nHe ran a political transition that ended with the election of the late Chief Moshood Abiola on June 12, 1993. Although adjudged widely as Nigeria’s freest and fairest ever, the election was inconclusive after results had been released in all the states. Babangida annulled the election.\nIn a statement he personally signed yesterday, Gen. Babangida canvassed:\n- devolution of power to states;\n- adoption of state police;\n- doing away with federal roads;\n- rejection of secession and hate speeches; and\n- a caution for the media.\nHe said the “drums of war are easy to beat, but their rhythms are difficult to dance”.\nHe said there was nothing romantic about war because “war is bad, condemnable and must be avoided”.\nBabangida said the fact that Nigeria had not realised its potentials as a great nation was not enough reason for it to want to demolish its foundation.\nBut he said it was time to restructure the country, with devolution of more powers to states.\nHe also said the nation was ripe for state police because policing has become sophisticated.\nBabangida, in a statement he personally signed, said the Civil War between 1967 and 1970 was preceded by similar hate speeches which the country had been witnessing in the past few weeks.\nHe said he cried out because he is still nursing the pains of the injury he sustained during the Civil War.\nThe former military leader urged the media to exercise caution in their reportage of volatile comments.\nHe said: “Nigeria, my dear country, is not a stranger to crisis, nor is she immune to it. In a profound sense, she can be said to have been created out of crisis, a nation state that will continue to strive to subdue and transcend crises. In over a century of its formalised colonial architecture, Nigeria has grown and made remarkable progress in the midst of crises.\n“The most tragic and horrendous episode in Nigeria’s history has been the 30-month Civil War of July 1967 to January 1970, in which many of our compatriots lost their lives. Indeed, many others also suffered terrible injuries of human and material dimensions.\n“So, who really wants to go through the depth and dimensions of another Civil War in Nigeria again? Who does not know that that Civil War was preceded and started by intolerance and a series of hate pronouncements, hate speeches, hate conducts and actions that were inflicted upon one another by the citizens?\n“Today, with a deep sense of nostalgia, I still carry within my body the pains of injury from the Civil War: there is nothing romantic about war; in any form, war is bad, condemnable and must be avoided.\n“I need hardly say I am very worried by the current ongoing altercations and vituperations of hate across the country by individuals, well-known leaders, religious leaders, group of persons and organisations.\n“We need to remind ourselves that conflicts are not evidently the stuff of politics and governance, particularly so of democracy, hence we must apply caution in our utterances, body language and news reportage.\n“The management of conflicts is the acid test of maturity, of mutual livelihood and of democratic governance. We cannot and we must not allow the current hate atmosphere to continue to freely pollute our political landscape unchecked.\n“Personally, I reject the proceedings of hate and their dissemination and urge my fellow citizens to strongly condemn the scourge and orgy of the current crisis which, in my view, is an outcome of vengeful appetites within the multiple contexts of our democratic governance and the profound inequalities that have distorted our social relations.\n“Nonetheless, it is not the place of leaderships to fuel and hype conflicts nor should we allow losers and gainers of our governance regimes to make pronouncements and threats that exploit our ethnic, religious and geopolitical construct. Democracy, anywhere in the world, is a work in progress; and one that is subject to constant evolution and debate.”\nBabangida cautioned those calling for civil war to break Nigeria to desist from such a venture because the consequences of war were “tellingly unpalatable.”\nHe said: “The drums of war are easy to beat, but their rhythms are difficult to dance. Starting wars or political upheavals comes with the slightest provocation, but ending them becomes inelastic, almost unending with painful footages of the wrecks of war. I have been involved and its ripples are tellingly unpalatable, with gory details of destruction and carnage.\n“I am a Nigerian, a citizen, patriot and concerned stakeholder. It is my strong belief that Nigeria can attain greater greatness if we all nurture our minds in the direction of building a nation, and accepting responsibility for its successes and failures.\n“We cannot deny or repudiate our progress at nation-building in spite of the limitations and challenges that we have continued to experience. As a people, we need a proper study and understanding of our history in order to correct the warped perceptions of our past so as to minimise the dangers of badly skewed stories of our democratic experience in governance; and to regenerate mutual confidence and uphold the tenets of living together as one country.\n“No one government or administration can provide all the answers to the myriad of problems and challenges confronting us as a country; no matter how determined, resolute, committed and motivated such a government is.\n“The citizens have their roles to play, and their obligations to fulfill in order to motivate government in achieving its stated goals and objectives. Governance is a function of the leadership and the followership. It is a two-way traffic that demands certain responsibilities from those involved.\n“Of late, Nigeria has become so sharply divided with emotions running high on the least provocations. Once tempers are that high, the fault-lines become easily visible and with the slightest prompting, the unexpected can happen.\n“But I want to believe that Nigerians are still their reasonable selves, highly endowed in various skills and intellectually empowered to compete anywhere in the global arena. As a Nigerian, I have had the rare privilege to benefit from robust relationships from different people across the socio-political divide; East, West, North and South.\n“I have also immensely interacted with persons from all the numerous tribes, cultures and ethnic configurations dotted across the entire gamut of Nigeria’s expansive lands. I have made friends, built alliances, nurtured relationships and sustained linkages amongst Nigerians of all shades and opinions.\n“In fairness, Nigerians are great people. In those hours, moments and duration of friendship and camaraderie, no one talks about origin, geopolitical zones or even states. The issue of religion does not dictate the flow of discourse. We deal with ourselves based on our character and content, and not the sentiments of what part of the country we hail from.\n“The inalienable fact that Nigerians can live in any part of the country to pursue their legitimate aspirations is a strong indication that we have accepted to invest in the Nigerian project, and are no longer driven by mutual suspicion but mutual respect.\n“That we have not fully realised our potentials as a great nation is not enough reason for us to want to demolish the foundation of our nationhood or rubbish the labours of our heroes past; both of which are borne out of our collective efforts to build a truly great nation, and great people.\n“If we have repeatedly done certain things and not getting the desired results, we need to change tactics and approach, and renew our commitment. It is our collective responsibilities to engender a reform that would be realistic and in sync with modern best practices.”\nIn Babangida’s view, it is time to restructure Nigeria with devolution of more powers to states.\nHe said restructuring would strengthen our structures to make the union more functional, based on our comparative advantages.\nHe added: “For example, restructuring has become a national appeal, as we speak, whose time has come. I will strongly advocate for devolution of powers to the extent that more responsibilities be given to the states while the Federal Government is vested with the responsibility to oversee our foreign policy, defence, and economy.\n“Even the idea of having Federal roads in towns and cities has become outdated and urgently needs revisiting. That means we need to tinker with our constitution to accommodate new thoughts that will strengthen our nationality.\n“Restructuring and devolution of powers will certainly not provide all the answers to our developmental challenges; it will help to reposition our mindset as we generate new ideas and initiatives that would make our union worthwhile.\n“The talk to have the country restructured means that Nigerians are agreed on our unity in diversity; but that we should strengthen our structures to make the union more functional based on our comparative advantages.”\nTo Babangida, Nigeria is ripe for state police – in line with global best practices.\nHe said: “Added to this desire is the need to commence the process of having State Police across the states of the Federation. This idea was contained in my manifesto in 2010 when I attempted to contest the presidential elections.\n“The initial fears that state governors will misuse the officers and men of the state police have become increasingly eliminated with renewed vigour in citizens’ participation in, and confidence to interrogate power. We cannot be detained by those fears and allow civilisation to leave us behind.\n“We must as a people with one destiny and common agenda take decisions for the sake of posterity in our shared commitment to launch our country on the path of development and growth. Policing has become so sophisticated that we cannot continue to operate our old methods and expect different results.”\nHe pleaded with the media to exercise caution and weigh security implications in their reportage.\nHe said: “I also want to appeal to the Nigeria media to be more circumspect in their news reportage. They should always weigh the security implications of the contents of their news and the screaming headlines that stare us in the face every day, especially at this fragile period of our political emanations. The media play an important and remarkable role in shaping the flow of discourse.\n“Their level of influence is also not in doubt, but as the fourth estate of the realm, it has a greater responsibility to moderate public discourse in a manner that will cement inter- and intra-cultural relationships. If Nigeria works, it benefits all her citizens; if it fails, it hurts all her citizens too. The media should be patriotic in its present engagements to berth a new Nigeria of our dreams.”\nBabangida said Nigerians should remain united by seeing strength, determination, commitment and confidence in their diversities rather than adversities.\nHe said: “On a final note, I really wish we see strength, determination, commitment and confidence in our diversities rather than adversities.\n“As a heterogeneous country with flourishing skills and numerous endowments, we should dictate the pace in Africa and lead by example of what is possible amongst a people that are focused and determined to pursue common national goal.\n“As a former Military President who had the rare privilege to travel around Africa to sustain the African cooperation through peace-keeping operations, I have come to the conclusion that nations are driven by a common ideal and not by the homogeneity of their race.\n“I saw Somalia, such a homogeneous conclave yet one of the most troubled countries in Africa today. I saw South Sudan, which broke away from the old Sudan, but peace and stability have eluded them. Rwanda genocidal experience is not romantic either.\n“But a President from the minority ethnic group has repositioned the country to assume its pride of place in the comity of nations. That a people share common identity, language, history, doctrine, culture, mores and values is not synonymous with development, growth, stability and peace.\n“When we went into peace-keeping operations in Sierra Leone, Somalia, Liberia and Congo, we had in mind to sustain oneness in Africa even though we are a continent of different countries all bearing different logos and identities. Our motivation was simply that we are Africans.\n“I am therefore appealing to the sensibilities of all of us, young and old, leaders and followers, groups and organisations, that in the interest of peace and stability of our country, we need to sheathe the sword. At 76, I have seen it all. I have seen war. I have fought war.\n“And I have survived war, even though I still suffer the pains and injuries of war, it is part of the selfless sacrifice to keep the union afloat. We must build a country that is forward looking for our children and future generations of Nigerians.\n“We cannot afford to toy with the destinies of the 170million Nigerians by the shape of our discourse and the content of our interaction.\n“We must carry out conscious attitudinal orientation that will change the mindset of our youths and the held beliefs of the elderly. We must explore the therapies of dialogue and constructive engagements in our desire to make life more meaningful for our people.\n“My friends cut across all regions, zones and states. I am proud to be a Nigerian because I see hope in the youthful population of Nigerians. I see remarkable skills and raw talents that can stimulate enterprise and innovations.\n“This is the end of the Holy Month of Ramadan, a month in which Muslim faithful have dedicated their lives to seek closeness to God, and forgiveness of their inequities. It is a month of penance; a month of prayer for physical, moral and spiritual rejuvenation, regeneration and rebirth. I urge my countrymen and women to use the occasion to look ahead with hope and renewed dedication to the service of our country.”","1":"http://thenationonlineng.net/ibb-backs-state-police-power-states/","2":"3108","3":"Politics","4":"1","5":"en","6":"0.9999885559"},{"0":"Vice President Professor Yemi Osinbajo\nVice President Yemi Osinbajo, SAN, has said that his primary assignment in government is to serve the people and honour God.\nProf. Osinbajo stated this on Sunday during the 65th birthday and retirement thanksgiving service for a notable Nigerian pilot, Capt. Usman Saleh Yahaya, which was held at ECWA Goodnews Church, Maitama, Abuja yesterday.\nThe VP said, “the scriptures say that we are the salt of the earth. Every time people ask me, they say, oh, why are you in government? And I say, why not?\n“The calling of God upon our lives is that we must be in service.

Now, salt is to make things better.\nThe VP then extended the issue to the church as an organization saying “it is the duty of the church never to lose hope. As a matter of fact, the only reason why hope is one of the central pillars of the church is because the history of mankind, the history of people, started from hopelessness. That is why we are there to give hope.”\nExpressing optimism in the country’s bright future, Prof. Osinbajo added, “I’m very confident that no matter what we are seeing today, our country will be great. I’m very confident that as the Scriptures say, weeping may endure for a night, but surely joy will come in the morning.”\nALSO READ: Suspended Sit-At-home: Fear as Imo residents go about their businesses\nIndeed prominent Nigerians from all walks of life have continued to praise Osinbajo for his service and dedication as Nigeria’s number two citizen.
